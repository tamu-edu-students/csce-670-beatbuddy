### Project Overview

BeatBuddy is a cutting-edge song recommendation tool that transforms the way you discover new music. By analyzing audio clips or music you've listened to, our algorithm suggests personalized tracks tailored to your unique tastes. But that's not all - our comprehensive search functionality allows you to explore songs by lyrics, genre, and more. Plus, our intelligent system recommends similar songs based on your preferences and ratings, ensuring you'll always find your next favorite track.
