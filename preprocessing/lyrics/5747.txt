14 ContributorsSay Goodbye Lyrics[Verse]
I do so much shit for you, but yet, all you do is call out my wrongs
I am always there for you, but yet, all you do is call out when I'm gone
Just make up your mind, I don't wanna waste my time
Stop sayin' that you love me when you don't even try
I been up since the AM, bottlin' up my emotions 'cause
When I say, "What's wrong?", that's another fuckin' wrong

[Chorus]
So I'm done, say goodbye
Go ahead and cry, yeah, you had all this time
So I'm done, say goodbye
Go ahead and cry, yeah, you had all this time

[Bridge]
And I've learned you can't do this like I can
You did me dark, goddamn
And I've learned you can't do this like I can
You did me dark, goddamn

[Chorus]
So I'm done, say goodbye
Go ahead and cry, yeah, you had all this time
So I'm done, say goodbye
What's the point of tryin' now when you had all this time?
