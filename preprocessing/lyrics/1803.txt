Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away
And the other watches him close from that wire
He says he wants to as well
But he is a liar

[Chorus]
I'll believe it all
There's nothing I won't understand
I'll believe it all
I won't let go of your hand
[Verse 2]
Two birds on a wire
One says, "C'mon," and the other says, "I'm tired,"
The sky is overcast and I'm sorry
One more or one less
Nobody's worried

[Chorus]
I'll believe it all
There's nothing I won't understand
I'll believe it all
I won't let go of your hand

He says that he will
But he's just a liar
Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away and the other
Watches him close from that wire
He says he wants to as well, but he is a liar

[Outro]
Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away and the other25Embed
