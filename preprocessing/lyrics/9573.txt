I'll have a blue Christmas without you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
(Ah, ah)
Won't be the same, dear, if you're not here with me
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's when those blue memories start callin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
(Ah, ah)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ah ooh)
(Ooh, ah ooh)

[Outro]
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
(Ah, ah)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)You might also like12Embed
