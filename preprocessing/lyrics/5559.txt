26 ContributorsThese Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
One of these days, the ground will drop
Out from beneath your feet
One of these days, your heart will stop
And play its final beat

[Verse 2]
One of these days, the clocks will stop
And time won't mean a thing
One of these days, their bombs will drop
And silence everything

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's alright, yeah, it's alright
Said it's alright

[Chorus]
Easy for you to say! Your heart has never been broken!
Your pride has never been stolen! Not yet, not yet!
One of these days, I bet your heart'll be broken!
I bet your pride'll be stolen! I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet!
One of these days, one of these days

[Verse 3]
One of these days, your eyes will close
And pain will disappear
One of these days, you will forget
To hope and learn to fear

[Chorus]
Easy for you to say! Your heart has never been broken!
Your pride has never been stolen! Not yet, not yet!
One of these days, I bet your heart'll be broken!
I bet your pride'll be stolen! I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet!
One of these days, one of these days

[Bridge]
But it's alright, yeah, it's alright
Said it's alright, yeah, it's alright
Don't say it's alright, don't say it's alright
Don't say it's alright

[Verse 4]
One of these days, your heart will stop
And play its final beat

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's alright

[Chorus]
Easy for you to say! Your heart has never been broken!
Your pride has never been stolen! Not yet, not yet!
One of these days, I bet your heart'll be broken!
I bet your pride'll be stolen! I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet!
One of these days, one of these days
