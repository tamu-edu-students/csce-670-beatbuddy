4 ContributorsWhen Scars Become Art Lyrics[Verse 1: Gatton]
So how
Will I trust you
When you say that you will love me? 'Cause she said that, too
And how
Will you love me?
I was told I didn't deserve love, at least that's the theme

[Verse 2: Gatton & Brooke Young]
Now don't say
Don't say that you'll stay for good
Don't tell me what I want to hear 'cause you think you should
And teach
Teach me to heal my scars
I've heard it said, that beauty is when scars become art

[Chorus: Gatton & Brooke Young]
'Cause I wanna love you for good
For good or for bad
When times get sad
And when we fight
And I wanna love you for good
For good or for bad
When you make me mad
'Cause you're the love of my life

So take my hand
I wanna grow old with you beside me
So take my hand
I wanna grow old with you beside me-e-e-e
So take my hand
I wanna grow old with you beside me, ohhh
So take my hand
I wanna grow old with you beside me

[Chorus: Gatton & Brooke Young]
'Cause I wanna love you for good
For good or for bad
When times get sad
And when we fight
And I wanna love you for good
For good or for bad
When you make me mad
'Cause you're the love of my life

[Outro: Gatton]
Now how
How will I move on?
You taught me how to love again and now you're gone
And how
Will I bear the pain?
I guess for now I'll leave these flowers here, at your graveEmbed
