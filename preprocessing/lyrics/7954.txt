I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, hm yeah, but I had to kill her
I had to put her six feet under
And I can still hear her complain

[Verse 1]
I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, hm yeah, but I had to kill her
I knew I'd miss her so I had to keep her
She's buried right in my backyard
[Verse 2]
I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, hm yeah, but I had to kill her
She bitched so much, she drove me nuts
And now I am happier this way
Woah, woah, yeah, take it for what it is

[Chorus]
I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, hm yeah, but I had to kill her
I had to put her six feet under
And I can still hear her complainYou might also like5Embed
