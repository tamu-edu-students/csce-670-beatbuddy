27 ContributorsFar from Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another day in this carnival of souls
Another night settles in as quickly as it goes
The memories of shadows, ink on the page
And I can't seem to find my way home

[Chorus]
And it's almost like
Your heaven's trying everything
Your heaven's trying everything to keep me out

[Verse 2]
All the places I've been and things I've seen
A million stories that made up a million shattered dreams
The faces of people I'll never see again
And I can't seem to find my way home

[Chorus]
'Cause it's almost like
Your heaven's trying everything
To break me down
'Cause it's almost like
Your heaven's trying everything
To keep me out

[Chorus]
'Cause it's almost like
Your heaven's trying everything
To break me down
'Cause it's almost like
Your heaven's trying everything
Your heaven's trying everything to break me down
To break me down
