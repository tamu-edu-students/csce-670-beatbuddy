And irony is okay, I suppose, culture is to blame

You lack substance when you say something like, "Oh, what a shame"
It's just a self-referential way that stops you having to be human

I'm sure that you're gonna say that I was sexist
I feel like you're running out of all the things I liked you for

[Chorus]
Why can't we be friends when we are lovers?
'Cause it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

When at your best, you're intermediately versed in your own feelings?
Keep on putting off conceiving, it's only you that you're deceiving
Oh, don't have a child, don't cramp your style, I'll leave it

[Chorus]
Why can't we be friends when we are lovers?
'Cause it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

In front of some sket who wanted bit on your—
