38 ContributorsMama Said Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done"
"The brightest flame burns quickest"
Is what I heard her say
A son's heart's owned to Mother
But I must find my way

[Chorus]
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still (be still)

[Verse 2]
"Rebel," my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still

[Bridge]
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

[Verse 3]
Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah-yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see
[Chorus]
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So, let this heart be still

[Outro]
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So, let this heart be still2Embed
