6 ContributorsRoss And Rachel Lyrics[Verse 1]
Started out as friends, only friends
But I knew from that moment (I knew from that moment)
That I was falling fast, falling fast
But you never noticed (You never noticed)

[Pre-Chorus]
I lived right down the hall
Like a fly, on the wall
Knew you better than you knew yourself (Yourself)
Couldn't get you alone, so I'd sit by the phone
I, put myself through Hell
Could you even tell?

[Chorus]
Thank God I waited
Thank God that I waited
'Cause my love never faded
I, just needed patience
It was always you
Yeah, it was always you
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah

Thank God I waited
Thank God that I waited
'Cause my love never faded
I, just needed patience
It was always you
Yeah, it was always you
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah
You might also like[Verse 2]
Remember when you slept at my place
We were kissin' and touchin' (Kissin' and touchin')
I thought you mind had changed
But you woke up and said it was nothin'
We're nothin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I lived right down the hall
Like a fly, on the wall
Knew you better than you knew yourself (Yourself)
Couldn't get you alone, so I'd sit by the phone
I, put myself through Hell
Could you even tell?

[Chorus]
Thank God I waited
Thank God that I waited
'Cause my love never faded
I, just needed patience
It was always you
Yeah, it was always you
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah
Thank God I waited
Thank God that I waited
'Cause my love never faded
I, just needed patience
It was always you
Yeah, it was always you
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Thank God I waited
Thank God that I waited
'Cause my love never faded
I, just needed patience
It was always you (Always you, yeah, haha)
Yeah it was always you
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah
Thank God I waited
Thank God that I waited
'Cause my love never faded
I, just needed patience
It was always you (Always you, yeah, haha)
Yeah it was always you

[Outro]
Yeah it was always you
Yeah it was always you
Yeah it was always you
Yeah it was always you
Oh yeah, yeah-yeahEmbed
