6 ContributorsBalloon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't know how to spin
But it can feel good just to
Move my limbs with the flow
I'll be your guy or I'll be your girl
If you wanna get down on the floor

[Hook]
Something's inside me
I feel like a god
Everything shaking in my eyes I see spots

[Verse 2]
I hear it again
Spinning through my head
Let the notes just sway out of tune
I could jump high
Or crawl to the floor
But I'm always just between the two
Maleena told me that the fruit will go bad
Live in this moment
Cus it could be your last

[Hook]
Lee Lee go round ring around the rose
In a dark lit club late at night
She cannot stop spin out of control
And her head just flies out of sight

Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover2Embed
