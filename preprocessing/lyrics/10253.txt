Lie next to me, baby
Don't call for days
Days just go on
Lie next to me, baby
Don't call for days
Days just go on

[Verse 1]
Look into the mirror, and I don’t know what to do
Mama telling me come here to show me what’s on the news
A kid of 9 years was hiding away the truth from their parents and their peers that he was bullied at school
They found him in his room hanging up from the ceiling
Mama told me, "Roger, you better tell me just how you feelin'"
I laughed, "Mama, you don’t gotta worry ‘bout a thing"
Gave her a kiss, caught my bus, and I cried along the way
I was getting picked on in the lunch line
All my friends ate, I ain't never touched mine
While my girl's fuckin’ ‘round with another guy
Dark thoughts started weighing on my young mind
But I ain't never been the type to go and unwind
So if you ask, my reply is just “I’m fine”
Until I get home, my mind doesn’t comply
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I just lie in my bed and just lie in my head
You might also like[Chorus]
Everything’s alright
No sleepin', it replays all night
No eating, only take small bites
No speaking, keep my jaw locked tight
Mama asking, “Everything alright?"
I smile, “Everything’s alright
I promise, everything’s alright"
Everything’s alright

[Bridge]
Everything's alright (Yeah, I’m fine)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright (It's okay)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright (Don't worry about it)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright (It's all good)
Everything's alright (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I’ve tried, and I’ve tried, I don't think I can do it
Only thing by my side is my mama and music
And I know that she gon' cry, maybe never get through it
But I don’t wanna be alive and Death is telling me "Prove it"
Bullies telling me "Do it", teachers think that I’m stupid
My nightmares turn to dreams; they get more lucid and lucid
Feel like a waste of a human, my friends find it amusing
So I just hope they get a laugh at what I’m ‘bout to go through with
Open the drawer and I find a boxcutter and slide it down my wrist
And let the blood run and spill off the sides
I scream and I cry, cause, yes, it hurts to die
But I can slowly feel the pain make its way out my mind
I’m sorry that I wasn’t good enough for you guys
Or strong enough to fight the pain, so I’m saying goodbye
As my life subsides, I close my eyes
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And just lie in my bed, and just lie in my head

[Chorus]
Everything’s alright
No sleepin', it replays all night
No eating, only take small bites
No speaking, keep my jaw locked tight
Mama asking, “Everything alright?”
I smile, “Everything’s alright
I promise, everything’s alright"
Everything’s alright

[Bridge/Outro]
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright
Everything’s alright...11Embed
