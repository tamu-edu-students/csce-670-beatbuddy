I found you at the window again
Looking out, watching the leaves falling in
And it was something like a dream
Wow, so perfect, couldn't talk to me

[Pre-Chorus: Samuel T. Herring]
Time moves slow
When you're all alone
And the time moves slow
When you're out on your own
And the time moves slow
When you're missing a friend
And the time moves slow
When you came to the end

[Chorus: Samuel T. Herring]
Running away is easy
It's the leaving that's hard
Running away is easy
Running away is easy
It's the living that's hard
And loving you was easy
It was you leaving that scarred

[Verse 2: Samuel T. Herring]
But what was I to do?
Just couldn't help myself falling in love with you
And what could I say?
Oh, if I had another chance
To make you stay
Cause when you ran away
I knew just what you were thinking that day
You just didn't love me like I do
Like I love you
The sad thing is we're better off this way

Time moves slow
When you can’t have a thing
Time moves slow
When you're lost in the dream
Time moves slow
When you wait by the phone
And the time moves slow
When you're all alone

[Chorus: Samuel T. Herring]
To run away is easy
It's the leaving that's hard
Running away is easy
Running away is easy
It's the living that's hard
And loving you was easy
It was you leaving that scarred

[Outro: Samuel T. Herring]
Cause when you're so alone
Time moves slow
When you're so alone
Time moves slow
When you're so alone
Time moves slow
