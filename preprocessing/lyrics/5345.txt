15 ContributorsYou Win Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
I couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down, my baby
I find out everybody know that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We gotta level before we go and tear this love apart

[Chorus]
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me, you win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through, you win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be, following you (I'll be, I'll be)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, girl

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, I shake you from now on
I'm gonna break down your defenses, one by one
I'm gonna hit you from all sides, lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you
You better beware, I swear
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside the greatest love of all
You might also like[Chorus]
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me, you win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through, you win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be, following you (I'll be, I'll be)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, girl

[Chorus / Outro]
You win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through, you win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be, following you (I'll be, I'll be)
Oh, oh girl
You win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth (No life)
No other could see me through, you win again
(No other could, no other could)
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me, you win again (This battle of love)
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through, you win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me, you win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete1Embed
