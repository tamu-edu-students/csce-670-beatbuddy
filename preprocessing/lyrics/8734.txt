Hey girl, with your head in the clouds?
I wanna love you, I wanna love you
Hey girl, I'm tryin' to figure you out
I wanna know you, I wanna know you

[Verse 1]
Held her as close as the dress
Pressed against my chest
I was seeing stars
Held her right in my left
Tryin' to catch my breath
Where the feelings are

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
La, da-da, da-da
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Heaven's above

[Chorus]
Hey girl, with your head in the clouds?
I wanna love you, I wanna love you
Hey girl, I'm tryin' to figure you out
I wanna know you, I wanna know you
Oh, good God, I'm tongue-tied
I'm a landslide when you move
Hey, girl with your head in the clouds?
I wanna love you, I wanna love you

Wrapped up in her again
I was starting to spin
A record I can't pause
An all-time heroine
With an angel's skin
And a human's flaws

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
La, da-da, da-da
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Heaven's above

[Chorus]
Hey girl, with your head in the clouds?
I wanna love you, I wanna love you
Hey girl, I'm tryin' to figure you out
I wanna know you, I wanna know you
Oh, good God, I'm tongue-tied
I'm a landslide when you move
Hey, girl with your head in the clouds?
I wanna love you, I wanna love you

[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, heaven's above)
Hey girl, with your head in the clouds?
I wanna love you, I wanna love youEmbed
