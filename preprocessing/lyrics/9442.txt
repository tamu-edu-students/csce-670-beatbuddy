7 ContributorsOceans & Galaxies Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know there's ten thousand miles between us now
Like the light of the moon looking down
I wish that I could reach you
Wish that I could crash upon your shore
How your waves made me love to drown

[Verse 2]
I need your touch but I don't know how
To write a line in the silver clouds
But you can reach me with your mind
We can cross the borderline
Wish I could fly at the speed of sound

[Chorus]
If we're ten thousand miles apart
When we're standing in the dark
We're still looking at the same stars
I'd cross oceans and galaxies for you
Oh, there's nothing I wouldn't do
Ten thousand miles apart
We'll never be too far

[Drop]
We'll never be too far
Ten thousand miles apart
You might also like[Chorus]
If we're ten thousand miles apart
When we're standing in the dark
We're still looking at the same stars
I'd cross oceans and galaxies for you
Oh, there's nothing I wouldn't do
Ten thousand miles apart
We'll never be too far (We'll never be too far)

[Bridge]
(I'd cross oceans and galaxies for you)
I'd cross oceans and galaxies for you
(Oh, oh woah)
(Oh, oh woah)
We'll never be too far

[Drop]
We'll never be too far
(We'll never be too far)
(Woah, oh woah)
Ten thousand miles apart
We'll never be too far1Embed
