I saw someone who looks just like you
In the back seat with her hand out the sunroof
I swear it was the dress that I gave you
And I wonder if your favorite color still blue?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're full of love, and wild and free
Chasin' every dream and possibility
You're more than I could ever be-e-e-e

[Chorus]
I hope He treats you better than I ever could
'Cause you deserve the world times two
And our simple Sunday afternoons
I hopе He's home for you evеn though I had to lose you
For you to find who fills your heart
Even if I'm not the one you choose
(Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ohh)

[Verse 2]
I thought I caught a glimpse of me and you
In our kitchen where I cooked your favorite food
And if I'm being honest, I was a fool
So say the word and I'll come runnin' back to you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And you're full of love, and wild and free
Chasin' every dream and possibility
You're more than I could ever be-e-e-e

[Chorus]
I hope He treats you better than I ever could
'Cause you deserve the world times two
And our simple Sunday afternoons
I hope He's home for you even though I had to lose you
For you to find who fills your heart
Even if I'm not the one you choose

[Bridge]
Ohh, oh-oh-oh, ohh, oh-oh-oh
Ohh, oh-oh-oh, ohh, mmm

[Chorus]
I hope He treats you better than I ever could
'Cause you deserve the world times two
And our simple Sunday afternoons
I hope He's home for you even though I had to lose you
For you to find who fills your heart
Even if I'm not the one you choose
(Ohh, ohh, ohh)
And I hope He's home for you
(Ohh, ohh, ohh)
And our Sunday afternoons8Embed
