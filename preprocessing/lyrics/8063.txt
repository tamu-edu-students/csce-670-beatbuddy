Running through my mind
The things I haven't told you (The things I haven’t told you)
Now I know I shouldn't lie
But I'm too scared to show you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, don’t you wanna know?
Could get out of my hands when you lie in my bed
Been tryna take it slow
But I'm losing control and God only knows, that I

[Chorus]
Wish that I could be your lover
I never met a girl like that
I could treat you like no other
Wanna be yours so bad
Let me make you feel real
Baby we, maybe we make love all night
Oh, oh, oh
Wish that I could be your lover
Wish that I could be your—, wish that I could—

[Verse 2]
Funny that I find
You don't wanna fight it (You don't wanna fight it)
Baby, there's no need to be shy
'Cause I can tell you like it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, don't you wanna know?
Could get out of my hands when you lie in my bеd
Been tryna take it slow
But I'm losing control and God only knows, that I

[Chorus]
Wish that I could be your lover
I nеver met a girl like that
I could treat you like no other (No other)
Wanna be yours so bad
Let me make you feel real
Baby we, maybe we make love all night
Oh, oh, oh
Wish that I could be your lover (Wish that I could be your—)
Wish that I could be your—, wish that I could—

[Bridge]
Baby, I want
Baby, I need it, I
You got me all in my feelings, I
I could be wrong (I could be wrong)
But baby, I mean it, I’ve held back for far too long
Oh, woah, woah
You’re my only
Leave my body when you hold me
So when we gonna
Baby, when you, love me when you
Baby, can you? Oh
[Chorus]
Wish that I could be your lover
I never met a girl like that
I could treat you like no other (No other)
Wanna be yours so bad
Let me make you feel real
Baby we, maybe we make love all night
Oh, oh, oh
Wish that I could be your lover (Wish that I could be your—)
Wish that I could be your—, wish that I could—Embed
