All of my friends finally convinced me to get out of the house
To help me forget, to help me move on
Then I heard you're back in town
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me that you were comin'

[Chorus: Shay Mooney & Dan Smyers]
So I should probably go to bed (Ah)
I should probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead (Ah)
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the mornin' (In the mornin')
I'll be callin' (I'll be callin')
Sayin' "sorry" for the things I said
So I, yeah, I should probably go to bed

[Verse 2: Shay Mooney]
So I don't undo the got-over-you
That I took so long to find
'Cause all it would take is seein' your face and I'd forget

[Chorus: Shay Mooney & Dan Smyers]
So I should probably go to bed (Ah)
I should probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead (Ah)
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the mornin' (In the mornin')
I'll be callin' (I'll be callin')
Sayin' "sorry" for the things I said
So I, yeah, I should probably go to bed

Before I question my decision
Is it love? I know it isn't
Now I'm all up in my head again
'Cause I know I don't have the self-control
To walk away if you walk in
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know
I should probably go to bed

[Chorus: Shay Mooney]
Ooh, I'm all up in my head (I'm all up in my head)
Ooh, I, I should go to bed (Go to bed)
Ooh, I'm (Go to bed) all up in my head (Go to bed)
Ooh, I, I should go to bed

[Outro: Shay Mooney]
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me that you were comin'
So I should probably go to bed7Embed
