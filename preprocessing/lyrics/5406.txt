Free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountaintop
Why don't you please yourself?
If it feels so good, then don't you, baby, don't you stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Baby, don't you—

[Verse 1]
Don't stand there waiting all of your life
For the night to come and find you
The clock is ticking, baby, now is the time
For someone to come and hold you

[Pre-Chorus]
You are a name, not a number
Extraordinary colours
Don't you hide undercover, baby

[Chorus]
Free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountaintop
Why don't you please (Please), yourself (Yourself)?
If it feels so good, then don't you, baby, don't you stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Baby, don't you—

If you feel it, if you feel it, take it (Over)
If you feel it, if you feel it, take it (Over)
If you feel it, if you feel it, take it (Over)
If you feel it, if you feel it, take it (Don't tease me)
If you feel it (Don't), if you feel it, take it (Don't tease me)
If you feel it (Don't), if you feel it, take it (Don't tease me)
