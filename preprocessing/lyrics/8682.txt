Feelings change, winter comes
Now your heart's colder than stone
Leavin' me outside
I can't face what I know
Pullin' us apart is all I'm good for
Left our love to die

[Post-Chorus]
I have hope, am I wrong?
Is part of us still, a part's still alive

[Chorus]
Feelings change, winter comes
Now your heart's colder than stone
Leavin' me outside
I'm to blame all along
Kept my own coat of ice on
Left our love to die

[Post-Chorus]
I have hope, am I wrong?
Is part of us still, a part's still alive

[Bridge]
Why do you leave me to wonder
If this is worth fightin' for?
Know I deserve what's comin'
But after thе pain, is there more?
Why do you lеave me to wonder
If this is worth fightin' for?
Know I deserve what's comin'
But after the pain, is there more?

Feelings change, winter comes
Now your heart's colder than stone
Leavin' me outside
I'm to blame all along
Kept my own coat of ice on
Left our love to die (I left our love to die)
Feelings change, winter comes
Now your heart's colder than stone
Leavin' me outside
I'm to blame all along
Kept my own coat of ice on
Left our love to die

[Post-Chorus]
I have hope, am I wrong?
Is part of us still, a part's still alive

[Outro]
Feelings change, you let go
Now you can't help where we are
Leavin' me outside
I can't face what I know
Pullin' us apart is all I'm good for
Left our love to die1Embed
