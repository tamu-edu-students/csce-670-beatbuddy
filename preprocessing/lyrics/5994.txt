4 ContributorsTrip to Valhalla Lyrics[Verse]
My mother told me
Someday I will buy
Galley with good oars
Sail to distant shores
Stand up on the prow
Noble barque I steer
Steady course to the haven
Hew many foemen
Hew many foemen

[Chorus]
My mother told me
Some day I will buy (Buy)
Galley with good oars
Sail to distant shores
Stand up on the prow
Noble barque I steer
(Steady) Steady course to the haven
Hew many foemen
Hew many foemen

[Rise]
(My mother told me)
