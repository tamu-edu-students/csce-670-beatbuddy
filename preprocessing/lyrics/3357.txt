10 Contributors​life got crazy Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like I'm living it twice
Saw all this shit in my mind
On my way back to you
Had twenty in the tank
And a pocket full of change
But I made that shit last for you

[Chorus]
Before life got crazy
Laying up in your bed
We was waking up with no cares
It feels like maybe
We could bring it right back
Back before we got on track
And life got crazy

[Verse 1]
Rolling Stoned
Big blunt rolled
Open road
I ain't worried 'bout much
I know
Shit is different
Hanging on baby
You might also like[Bridge]
'Cause we living so fast
Tryna break bread with the homies
Got a big head, yeah you know me
Life's like that
Never get ahead, moving slowly
Then it went left, went Ginobili
When life got crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like I'm living it twice
Saw all this shit in my mind
On my way back to you
Had twenty in the tank
And a pocket full of change
But I made that shit last for you

[Chorus]
Before life got crazy
Laying up in your bed
We was waking up with no cares
It feels like maybe
We could bring it right back
Back before we got on track
And life got crazy
[Verse 2]
Even if I go to hell I won't be lonely
If I was sinning I was sinning with the homies
Even if I go to hell I won't be lonely ever
At least I have my homies in there

[Bridge]
'Cause we living so fast
Tryna break bread with the homies
Got a big head, yeah you know me
Life's like that
Never get ahead, moving slowly
Then it went left, went Ginobili
When life got crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like I'm living it twice
Saw all this shit in my mind
On my way back to you
Had twenty in the tank
And a pocket full of change
But I made that shit last for you

[Outro]
Before life got crazy
Life got crazy
Got crazy
For real
Life got crazy on you
Just got to keep going
Even if I go to hell I won't be lonely
If I was sinning I was sinning with the homies1Embed
