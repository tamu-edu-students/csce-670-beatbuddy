5 ContributorsRide Or Die Lyrics[Verse]
I follow you into another night
We stay awake until we lost in time
We don't hear them calling, lights won't fade away
I will stay here forever on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
At the bar at the hotel, and on my head, whoa
Dropped eyes in the motel, and that's when you said
I'll be here in the morning, you can touch the sky, no I
Don't like that I'm all in, you're my ride or die

[Chorus]
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-ra
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-ra-da-ra
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-ra
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-ra-da-ra

[Verse]
I follow you into another night
We stay awake until we lost in time
We don't hear them calling, lights won't fade away
I will stay herе forever on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
At the bar at thе hotel, and on my head, whoa
Dropped eyes in the motel, and that's when you said
I'll be here in the morning, you can touch the sky, no I
Don't like that I'm all in, you're my ride or die
