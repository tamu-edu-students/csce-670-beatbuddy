22 ContributorsAnd I Love Her Lyrics[Verse 1]
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

[Verse 2]
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

[Bridge]
A love like ours
Will never die
As long as I
Hold you near me

[Verse 3]
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love herYou might also like31Embed
