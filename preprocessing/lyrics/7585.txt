I've been cursed, I've been crossed
I've been beaten by the ones that get me off
I've been cut, I've been opened up
I've been shattered by the ones I thought I loved

[Chorus]
You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain to wash away, wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway (Anyway)
All you left behind (Behind)
Is a chalk outline (Outline)

[Verse 2]
I've been cold in the crypt
But not as cold as the words across your lips (Lips)
You'll be sorry, baby, someday
When you reach across the bed, where my body used to lay

[Chorus]
You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain to wash away, wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway (Anyway)
All you left behind (Behind)
Is a chalk outline (Outline)
You might also like[Bridge]
All you left behind (Behind)
Is a chalk outline (Outline)
(All you left behind)

[Chorus]
You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain to wash away, wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway (Anyway)
All you left behind (Behind)
Is a chalk outline9Embed
