Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold
If she floats then she is not
A witch like we've thought
A down payment on another
One at Salem's lot

[Chorus]
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants
That legendary divorce is such a bore

[Verse 2]
As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead, I had a dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before
You might also like[Chorus]
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants
That legendary divorce is such a bore

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants
That legendary divorce is such a bore30Embed
