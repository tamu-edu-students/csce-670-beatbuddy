Hi there, say hello without being extra
Let’s start, without introductions
No touching, back off back off
I like it like this balance, balance

[Verse 2]
It's me, it's me nothing different
What are they gossiping about me these days?
The searching light scanner, scanner
What's my score today? Jealous, jealous

[Pre-Chorus]
"Why does she like that kind of outfit?
What’s that blank face she’s making?
Maybe it's because of stress?
I'm worried about her''

[Chorus]
Yellow C-A-R-D
If you cross this line, it’s a violation, beep
Keeping manners stop here, it’s mi-mi-mi-mine
Please keep the li-li-li-line

[Post-Chorus]
Hello stu-P-I-D
If you cross that line, I’ll get serious, beep
Stop it, keep the distance
Cause we don’t know, know, know, know
Comma, we don’t owe, owe, owe, owe
(Any-anything)

I don’t care what your secret is
All of your stories
Let me politely decline, not my business
I like it like this talk, talk less

[Verse 5]
Still me, still me, no need to be surprised
I’m sure you’re gonna say “My gosh!”
Your eyes getting busy, check-checking
Like playing spot the difference, oh hashtagging

[Pre-Chorus]
''She’s walking so straight, she might trip and fall
Wonder if she knows everyone’s whispering about her
I think she’s hanging out with that person everyone’s talking about
She has problems''

[Chorus]
Yellow C-A-R-D
If you cross this line, it’s a violation, beep
Keeping manners stop here, it’s mi-mi-mi-mine
Please keep the li-li-li-line

[Post-Chorus]
Hello stu-P-I-D
If you cross that line, I’ll get serious, beep
Stop it, keep the distance
Cause we don’t know, know, know, know
Comma, we don’t owe, owe, owe, owe
(Anything)
[Bridge]
Let me do this comfortably
Hey you, do you understand what I’m saying? Huh?
I don’t believe it
I’m sure you still don’t know
Am I wrong? Am I the bad guy again? Huh?
I don’t believe it
Turn on your signal lights, you have no class, knock, knock, knock, knock
'Nough, I won’t deal with you anymore, block, block, block, block, block
If you don’t know, start memorizing this babe
Repeat, repeat, so easy, right?

[Chorus]
Yellow C-A-R-D
If you cross this line, it’s a violation, beep
Keeping manners stop here, it’s mi-mi-mi-mine
Please keep the li-li-li-line

[Post-Chorus]
Hello stu-P-I-D
If you cross that line, I’ll get serious, beep
Stop it, keep the distance
Cause we don’t know, know, know, know
Comma, we don’t owe, owe, owe, owe
