14 ContributorsSolitude Lyrics[Verse 1]
In my solitude
You haunt me
With reveries
Of days gone by
In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

[Bridge]
I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

[Verse 2]
In my solitude
I'm prayin'
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

[Bridge]
I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm prayin'
Dear Lord above
Send me back my love6Embed
