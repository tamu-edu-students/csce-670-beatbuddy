2 ContributorsJealous of Paris Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm jealous of Paris and all the cafes
All the baristas who get to write your name
I'm jealous of all of the people around you
That have you to get to know
And I'm just the girl you once knew from back home

[Verse 2]
Now the Eiffel Tower knows all about your eyes
The deepest of browns, I bet Paris has been nothing but mesmerized
I'm jealous of all the romance in that city
That doesn't have to let go
Now I'm just the girl you once knew from back home

[Bridge]
So I guess I'll just cancel my flight
You're not the guy I knew who used to try
To make things right
If anyone knows how hard it is, it's me
I tried to tell you but you couldn't see
Beyond that city

[Verse 3]
I'm jealous of Paris 'cause she won your heart
And I'm just the same old girl living right off of Sunset Boulevard
It's really hard to admit what it is
We couldn't change and grow
So I'm just the girl you once knew from back home, oh-oh-oh
And that was the only you that I'll ever knowYou might also likeEmbed
