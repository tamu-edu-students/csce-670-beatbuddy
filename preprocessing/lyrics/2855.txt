Oh, I cannot explain
Every time, it's the same
Oh, I feel that it's real, take my heart
I've been lonely too long
Oh, I can't be so strong
Take a chance for romance, take my heart
I need you so
There's no time, I'll ever go

[Chorus: solo and falsetto choir]
Cheri Cheri Lady, goin' through emotion
Love is where you find it, listen to your heart
Cheri Cheri Lady, livin' in devotion
It's always like the first time, let me take a part
Cheri Cheri Lady, like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart, don't lose it, listen to your heart
Cheri Cheri Lady, to know you is to love you
If you call me, baby, I'll be always yours

[Verse 2]
I get up and get down
All my world turns around
Who is right? Who is wrong? I don't know
I've got pain in my heart, got a love in my soul
Easy come, but I think easy go
I need you so
All those times
I'm not so strong
