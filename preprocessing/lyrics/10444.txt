I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture

[Chorus 1]
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty

[Verse 2]
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally

[Chorus 2]
I'm so tired, I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief
Sit and drink Pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic royalty

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids

Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty

[Outro]
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Ha, ha
