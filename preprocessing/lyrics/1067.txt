So I never really knew you
God, I really tried to
Blindsided, addicted
Thought we could really do this
But really, I was foolish
Hindsight, it's obvious

[Pre-Chorus]
Talking with my lawyer
She said, "Where’d you find this guy?"
I said, "Young people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes"

[Chorus]
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you’re in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

It's funny how a memory
Turns into a bad dream
When running wild turns volatile
Remember how we painted our house
Just like my grandparents did
So romantic, but we fought the whole time
Should've seen the signs, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Talking with my mother
She said, "Where’d you find this guy?"
Said, "Some people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes"

[Chorus]
Some mistakes get made
That’s alright, that's okay
You can think that you’re in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it’s better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
[Bridge]
They say it's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
That could be a load of shit
But I just need to tell you all

[Chorus]
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just engaged
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

[Outro]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)45Embed
