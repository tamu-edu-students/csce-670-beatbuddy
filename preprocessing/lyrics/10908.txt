44 ContributorsCreep Lyrics[Verse 1]
Forward yesterday
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real
Makes me wanna steal
Living under house
Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
Alls I gots is time
Got no meaning, just a rhyme

[Pre-Chorus]
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

[Chorus]
I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(Well, this I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
Half the man I used to be

Feelin' uninspired
Think I'll start a fire
Everybody run
Bobby's got a gun
"Think you're kinda neat"
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

[Chorus]
I'm half the man I used to be
(And this I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(And this I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(Oh, this I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
Half the man I used to be
[Interlude]
(Half the man)
(Hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

[Chorus]
I'm half the man I used to be
(Well, this I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(Well, this I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(For this I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
Half the man I used to be
Half the man I used to be19Embed
