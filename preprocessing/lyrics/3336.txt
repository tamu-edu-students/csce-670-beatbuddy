3 ContributorsWhat If I Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]
They say it's once in a lifetime
You only get one, so guess that I'm done for life, hm
You're doin' just fine
I knew that you would, I bet she looks good tonight, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody knows you in the city
Every street is bringing back a memory
Wish I'd run into you accidentally
Still looking for your car, just kill me

[Chorus]
By now, I should be okay
That's easy for you to say
What if I loved you?
What if I loved you way too much?
What if I love you?
What if I love you way too much?

[Verse 2]
They say it's one in a lifetime
But does it really count if you were like, "Nevermind"?
And I'm being too nice
Droppin' it all just to see you at night (Yeah)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody knows you in this city
Evеry street is bringing back a memory
Calling you again, I guess you're busy
Still wishing you wеre here, just kill me

[Chorus]
By now, I should be okay
That's easy for you to say
What if I loved you?
What if I loved you way too much?
What if I love you?
What if I love you way too much?

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody knows you in the city
Every street is bringing back a memory
Wish I'd run into you accidentally
Still looking for your car, just kill me

[Chorus]
By now, I should be okay
That's easy for you to say
What if I loved you?
What if I loved you way too much?
What if I love you?
What if I love...?Embed
