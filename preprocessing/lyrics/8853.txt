3 ContributorsLove Runs Deep Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've been walking under dark clouds
Starting to feel that you're not strong enough
Fighting battles with the same doubts
Trying to hold on but the pain lets out

[Pre-Chorus]
When your heads getting heavy
Let me be your pillow
I love you when you let me in, let me in
When your heads getting heavy
Let me be your pillow
I love you when you let me in, let me in

[Chorus]
If you're feeling love
It'll help you back together, love you back
If you're feeling lovе
It'll help you back together, lovе you back

If you're feeling love
Times are hard but my love runs deep

[Verse 2]
If you need a friend you'll know where I'll be
Times are hard but my love it runs deep
Make a promise but this one I'm going to keep
I'll be there whenever you're in need
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When your heads getting heavy
Let me be your pillow
I love you when you let me in, let me in
When your heads getting heavy
Let me be your pillow
I love you when you let me in, let me in

[Chorus]
If you're feeling love
It'll help you back together, love you back
If you're feeling love
It'll help you back together, love you back
If you're feeling love
Times are hard but my love runs deepEmbed
