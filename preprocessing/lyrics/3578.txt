Two nights ago she got that look in her eyes
Kaleidoscope, but that's only half the time
Three days before she told me that I don't even try
She's crazy, though, I guess there's something wrong inside

[Hook]
Maybe you're right, maybe this is all that I can be
But what if it's you, and it wasn't me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

[Verse 2]
Four weeks ahead, I thought that I should think some more
I'm fucked in the head, and my mind is turning into a whore
Five months go by, and I thought about letting her go
She's crazy, though, and I guess she took control
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, no

[Hook]
Maybe you're right, maybe this is all that I can be
But what if it's you, and it wasn't me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

[Bridge]
Maybe she's right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe we'll fight 'til they move us along
I can't deny writing a song
Hoping she'll find she's not alone
You might also like[Hook]
Maybe you're right, maybe this is all that I can be
But what if it's you, and it wasn't me? Oh
What... (What do you want from me?)
(What do you want? What do you want?)
...Do you want from me?
What... (What do you want from me?)
(What do you want? What do you want?)
...Do you want from me now?62Embed
