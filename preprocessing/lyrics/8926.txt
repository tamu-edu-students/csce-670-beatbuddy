[Chorus]
Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

[Verse 1]
She's a witch of trouble in electric blue
In her own mad mind she's in love with you
With you
Now, what you gonna do?

[Chorus]
Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

[Verse 2]
She's some kind of demon messin' in the glue
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you
To you
What kind of fool are you?

[Chorus]
Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

[Verse 3]
On a boat in the middle of a raging sea
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored
And wouldn't you be bored?

[Chorus]
Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

[Bridge]
Strange brew
Strange brew
Strange brew
Strange brew

[Chorus]
Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you6Embed
