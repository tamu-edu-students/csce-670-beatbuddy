5 ContributorsCasual Sex Lyrics[Verse 1]
You'll never meet my mom, strings will never be attached
We'll always get along 'cause it doesn't have to last
And any time I call, you don't have to call me back
I'm never gonna fall, but I'm never hard to catch

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she's cool with it, she's down with it
There's nothing wrong with it, 'cause it's easier this way
She's so cool with it, she's down with it
There's nothing wrong with it, don't want it any other way

[Chorus]
It's just your typical, hardcore, casual sex
We're single but we're lovers, crazy for each other
Just your typical, hardcore, casual sex
We're wild under the covers, crazy for each other

[Verse 2]
We don't have to go on dates, you don't have to like my friends
I won't get in your face when you're making other plans
If you're tired of the taste, we can try another blend
My heart will never break, I'm just here to break a sweat

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why she's cool with it, she's down with it
There's nothing wrong with it, 'cause it's easier this way
She's so cool with it, she's down with it
There's nothing wrong with it, don't want it any other way

It's just your typical, hardcore, casual sex
We're single but we're lovers, crazy for each other
Just your typical, hardcore, casual sex
We're wild under the covers, crazy for each other

[Bridge]
She's so cool with it, she's down with it
There's nothing wrong with it, 'cause it's easier this way
She's so cool with it, she's down with it
There's nothing wrong with it, don't want it any other way

[Chorus]
It's just your typical, hardcore, casual sex
We're single but we're lovers, crazy for each other
Just your typical, hardcore, casual sex
We're wild under the covers, crazy for each other

[Outro]
Everybody wants a lover like that
Wild under the covers, crazy for each other
Everybody wants to love her like that
Wild under the covers, crazy for each other1Embed
