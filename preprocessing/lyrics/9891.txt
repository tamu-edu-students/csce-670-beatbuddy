5 ContributorsWhy You Gotta Lie? Lyrics[Intro: Sean Kingston]
She's indecisive, she can't decide
She keeps on lookin' from left to right (Narline)
Girl, come a bit closer, look in my eyes (Prince Baza presents)
Searching is so wrong, I'm Mr. Right
You seem like the type to love 'em and leave 'em
And disappear right after this song
So give me the night to show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancing alone

[Chorus]
So look me in the eye, eye, еye, eye, еye
Why you gotta lie, lie, lie, lie, lie?
You're messin' up my mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Baby, I'm just tryna change your life
She say that she all mine, am I meant to trust her
When she cannot decide if she want a lover?
I'm tryna be the guy, but you're wantin' another
Will I ever find me a wife? I wonder, oh, woah

[Verse 1]
She think I'm type to love 'em and leave 'em, but I never left without reason
Jump in the whip, it don't need the keys in
Tryna put you in the latest season
Ah, I got what you're needin'
Since demon, I've been up in my feelings
Still grievin', but I can't complain 'cause shit could be worse, I'm still here breathin' (No cap)
You just gotta believe it
I got me a dream, so I gotta achieve it
Said to the end, but they end up leavin'
Don't make sense, uh, fuck all the feelings (Argh)
'Cah my heart still beatin'
Shit's been bad, but you end healin'
I trust one bitch and she end up cheatin' (She end up cheatin')
You might also like[Chorus]
So look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye, eye
Why you gotta lie, lie, lie, lie, lie?
You're messin' up my mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Baby, I'm just tryna change your life
She say that she all mine, am I meant to trust her
When she cannot decide if she want a lover?
I'm tryna be the guy, but you're wantin' another
Will I ever find me a wife? I wonder, oh, woah

[Verse 2]
Yo, how can I win if we keep on losin'?
I know my worth, so I gotta get movin'
Don't need girls, fell in love with the music
If you want me, stop pickin' and choosin' (Stop pickin' and choosin')
'Cause I'm done with the usin'
See right through, you must think that I'm stupid
Block too hot, but our love be humid
I shot my shot, need help from Cupid

[Chorus]
So look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye, eye
Why you gotta lie, lie, lie, lie, lie?
You're messin' up my mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Baby, I'm just tryna change your life
She say that she all mine, am I meant to trust her
When she cannot decide if she want a lover?
I'm tryna be the guy, but you're wantin' another
Will I ever find me a wife? I wonder, oh, woahEmbed
