I gotta watch my back
Probably pack my bags
You're like a computer crash, baby, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was wrong so she left me
Now I'm down on my left knee
But I'm gone in a jet speed
Get around like a ten-speed

[Chorus]
I gotta watch my back
Probably pack my bags
You're like a computer crash, baby, ah, baby, ah
Or maybe it's not that bad
Pretend like I'm not that sad
She only know how to make me mad (How to make me mad)

[Verse 1]
Uh, you don't know a damn thing
Uh, you don't know a damn thing
Uh, you don't know a damn thing
You don't know a—, you don't know a damn thing
Uh, baby, that's a damn shame
Uh, baby, that's a damn shame
Uh, baby, that's a damn shame
Baby, that's a—, baby, that's a damn shame

I can't rock with that, I can't rock with that
You just hold me back and it makes me mad
I can't rock with that, I can't rock with that
You just hold me back and it makes me mad

[Chorus]
I gotta watch my back
Probably pack my bags
You're like computer crash, baby, ah, baby, ah
Or maybe it's not that bad
Pretend like I'm not that sad
She only know how to make me mad (How to make me mad)

[Verse 2]
I bet she does it with ease, I bet she does it to tease
And now she got in my dreams, I'm a nightmare
This ain't how I used to see
I guess it wasn't to be
Not everything is what it seems
Making that clear
I think I saw the Devil in her eyes
I sink, I fall, this happens every time
Go ahead and call upon another guy
This is way, way, way too much for me
The demons keep her company
[Chorus]
I gotta watch my back
Probably pack my bags
You're like computer crash, baby, ah, baby, ah
Or maybe it's not that bad
Pretend like I'm not that sad
She only know how to make me mad (How to make me mad)2Embed
