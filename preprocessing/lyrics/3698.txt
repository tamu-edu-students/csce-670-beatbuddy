3 ContributorsOne Day Lyrics[Intro]
One day we'll be older
Remember the words that mama told ya

[Verse 1]
Life can go so fast
We can do our best
Always chase the end of the rainbow
Sometimes we're too late
Think we gonna break
But we will never fade out

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me, oh, let me, oh, let me breathe
The world has gone crazy and I can't sleep
Take all your dreams, make your memories
Memoriеs

[Chorus]
One day we'll be oldеr
Remember the words that mama told ya
Some days are bright and some are colder
So let's not waste time and hold me closer
One day we'll be older
Remember the words that mama told ya
Some days are bright and some are colder
So let's not waste time and hold me closer
Oh
You might also like[Verse 2]
People talk so loud, we still figure out
Just tryna find a way through the darkness (Darkness)
Money, drugs and cars won't help with all the scars (Scars)
You gotta hear what your heart says (Hear what your heart says)

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me, oh, let me, oh, let me breathe
The world has gone crazy and I can't sleep
Take all your dreams, make your memories
Memories

[Chorus]
One day we'll be older
Remember the words that mama told ya
Some days are bright and some are colder
So let's not waste time and hold me closer
One day we'll be older
Remember the words that mama told ya
Some days are bright and some are colder
So let's not waste time and hold me closer (Closer)
One day we'll be older
Remember the words that mama told ya
Some days are bright and some are colder
So let's not waste time and hold me closerEmbed
