10 ContributorsLoser Lyrics[Verse 1]
Breathe in right away
Nothing seems to fill this place
I need this every time
So take your lies, get off my case
Someday I will find
A love that flows through me like this
This will fall away
This will fall away

[Chorus]
You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later, you know I'll be dead
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
'Cause I'm a loser
I'm a loser, yeah

[Verse 2]
This is getting old
I can't break these chains that I hold
My body's growing cold
There's nothing left of this mind or my soul
Addiction needs a pacifier
The buzz of this poison is taking me higher
And this will fall away
This will fall away
You might also like[Chorus]
You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later, you know I'll be dead
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
Cause I’m a loser, I’m a loser, yeah
You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later, you know I'll be dead
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
Cause I’m a loser, I’m a loser, yeah
You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later, you know I'll be dead
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
Cause I’m a loser, I’m a loser, yeah3Embed
