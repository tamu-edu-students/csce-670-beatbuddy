I was made for lovin' you, baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

[Drop: Nile Rodgers, House Gospel Choir]
Made for love
It's what I'm made for
I can't get enough
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

I was made for lovin' you, baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?
I was made for lovin' you, baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can give it all to you, baby (I want it all)
Can you give it all to me? (Ooh-woah)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
