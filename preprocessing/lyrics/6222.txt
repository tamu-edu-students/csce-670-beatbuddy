Hold on for a second
If words can be weapons
Then what I say can affect it
They're not just words on a record
And I can choose to respect it
Or choose to infect it
But once that hits the water
It's too late to be selective

[Refrain]
If one voice is enough
To make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up
And watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark
One faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart
Before it all falls apart

[Pre-Chorus]
So stand up, shout it out
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let's make it count
It's a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out
Sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out
And before we depart let's leave a mark
'Cause light shines brighter in the dark
You might also like[Chorus]
When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road

[Verse 2]
So hold on for a moment
If we're not scared of opponents
Then with what we have we can own it
We just plant the seed and keep groanin'
And when that light shines in the mornin'
They'll still be wakin' up yawnin'
We'll be smilin' like we expected
Sweet victory, one method

[Refrain]
'Cause one voice is enough
To make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up
And watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark
One faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart
Before it all falls apart
[Pre-Chorus]
So stand up, shout it out
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let's make it count
It's a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out
Sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out
And before we depart let's leave a mark
'Cause light shines brighter in the dark

[Chorus]
When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road
When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road

[Bridge]
And I can choose to respect it
Or choose to infect it
But once that hits the water
It's too late to be selective
If one voice is enough
To make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up
And watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief one spark
One faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart
Before it all falls apart
[Chorus]
When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road
When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road
On this untraveled road
On this untraveled road6Embed
