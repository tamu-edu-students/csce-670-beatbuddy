1 ContributorFaithful God Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am surrounded
On every side, can't see the light of day
But I am persuaded
Beyond all hope, You won't let go of me
I stake my claim on every word You say
You will not be late

[Chorus]
I will sing through ﬁre and thunder
'Cause You are on my side
I trust You with my life
I know my story, it isn't over
Even against all odds
You are a faithful God
You're faithful God

[Verse 2]
The darkest of weather
Though I can't see, I still believe You're good
So I'm moving forward
Through crashing waves, I know I'm safe with You
You hold my life, You hear my cry
With every breath inside

[Chorus]
I will sing through ﬁre and thunder
'Cause You are on my side
I trust You with my life
I know my story, it isn't over
Even against all odds
For You are a faithful God
That's who You are
You are a faithful God
You might also like[Bridge]
I am convinced that Your promises will hold together
And I will dwell in the hope of Your love forever
I am convinced that Your promises will hold together
And I will dwell in Your love

[Chorus]
And I will sing through ﬁre and thunder
'Cause You are on my side
I trust You with my life
I know my story, it isn't over
Even against all odds
Oh, You are a faithful God (Yeah)
That's who You are

[Outro]
Oh, You are a faithful God
Oh, You're faithful GodEmbed
