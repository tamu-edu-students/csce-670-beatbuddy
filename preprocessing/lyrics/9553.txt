3 ContributorsPlay with Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby let me take the pressure off you
I'll make the first move and do what I got to
Can we slow this down to my pace?
I'ma make you fall in love
And let me show you what my body do
How a real woman do
Cause I do what I got to
Let me take you back to my place
Where I'll make you fall in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Take it back to basics, no ego in the way
Put this cookie on your face, to remind you of your place
In the back seat of your car, where I know I hit it first
Have you losing all control, when I whisper to you

[Chorus]
I just wanna play with your body
I just wanna play with your body
Oh and if I play with your body
Will you play with me?
I just wanna play with your body
I just wanna play with your body
Oh and if I play with you daddy
Will you play with me?
You might also likeAnd I ain't got time for games no more
Delusional setbacks
Yeah these bitches play too hard to get
Make you lose and fall back
Getting psycho on some bullshit
I don't give a fuck 'bout that
I'ma hold it down and throw it down
As soon as you get back

[Pre-Chorus]
Take it back to basics, no ego in the way
Put this cookie on your face, to remind you of your place
In the back seat of your car, where I know I hit it first
Have you losing all control, when I whisper to you

[Chorus]
I just wanna play with your body
I just wanna play with your body
Oh and if I play with you daddy
Will you play with me?
I just wanna play with your body
I just wanna play with your body
Oh and if I play with you daddy
Will you play with me?

[Outro]
Take it, take it back to
Back to basics, basics
Take it, take it back to
Back to basics, basics
Take it, take it back to
Back to basics
Will you play with me?
Take it, take it back to
Back to basics, basics
Take it, take it back to
Back to basics, basics
Take it, take it back to
Back to basics
Will you play with me?1Embed
