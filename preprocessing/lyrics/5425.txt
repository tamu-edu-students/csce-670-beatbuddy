You say I spend too much time
In my head and it holds me back
I think you spend too much time
Givin' me second chances that
I don't deserve
And it hurts

[Chorus]
You give me the kinda love that I never had
Wish that I could love, love, love you back
Wish that I could love, love, love you back
Wish that I could love like that
You give me your unconditional
Don't mean to sound so typical
But I wish that I could love, love, love you back
Wish that I could love like that, mmm
Wish that I could love like

[Verse 2]
You, that weekend, we were sleeping
In that London hotel room
Heard you singing in the shower
Damn near broke my heart in two
And I don't deserve you
And it hurts to

Get the kinda love that you never had
Wish that you could give, give, give it back
Wish that I could love, love, love you back
Wish that I could love like that

Don't mean to sound so typical
But I wish that I could love, love, love you back
Wish that I could love like that
Ah-ooh, wish that I could love like that

[Bridge]
But look at us, we're in a room half-crowded
And I wish that I could finish what we started
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
To give the kinda love that you deserve
Knowing that I can't just makes it worse
Wish that I could love, love, love you back
Wish that I could love like that
You give me your unconditional
Don't mean to sound so typical
But I wish that I could love, love, love you back
Wish that I could love like that
[Outro]

Wish that I could
You are perfect
