Come on, people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

[Verse 1]
When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions

[Chorus]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

[Verse 2]
Never met a wise man
If so, it's a woman

[Chorus]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

[Verse 3]
Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you
You might also like[Chorus]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, ah, ah, yeah46Embed
