10 ContributorsSmile Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're always there to listen
You always put me first
When nobody else gets it
It's us against the world

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, you know me better than I know myself
And when I'm down, I always reach to you for help
And I don't say it often
But without you, I'm not much

[Chorus]
I see me when I'm lookin' at you
We both know all the things we've been through
When you cry, you know I feel it too, but
When you smile, I smile

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' that connects us
We've always felt it there
Ain't no one I love better
There's no one who compares

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, you know me better than I know myself
And when I'm down, I always reach to you for help
And I don't say it often
But without you, I'm not much
You might also like[Chorus]
I see me when I'm lookin' at you
We both know all the things we've been through
When you cry, you know I feel it too, but
When you smile, I smile, yeah
Know with me, you'll never be alone
Know with me, you'll always have a home, yeah
When you cry, you know I feel it too, but
When you smile, I smile

[Bridge]
(When you smile) I smile
(When you smile) I smile

[Chorus]
I see me when I'm lookin' at you
We both know all the things we've been through
When you cry, you know I feel it too, but
When you smile, I smile, yeah
Know with me, you'll never be alone
Know with me, you'll always have a home, yeah
When you cry, you know I feel it too, but
When you smile, I smile

[Outro]
I smile
Know with me, you'll never be alone
Know with me, you'll always have a home, yeah
When you smile, I smileEmbed
