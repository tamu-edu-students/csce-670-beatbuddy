11 ContributorsIn the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got lost in the wilderness
I thought I was surely fallin' apart
The pain you caused cut so deep
Truly was a work of art

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care what they say
I'm gonna do it anyway (Ooh-ooh)
It's the only thing I see
Always staring back at me (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I've been left in the dark
Standing cold in the night
Memories of your taste, I've been holding on tight
Falling apart and I'm living a lie
All of this time
I've been loving a liar

[Verse 2]
Pulled me in with your words so sweet
Every time I ignored the sign
Redemption's mine on the day I leave
Fallin' for you was my only crime
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care what they say
I'm gonna do it anyway (Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, it's the only thing I see
Always staring back at me (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I've been left in the dark
Standing cold in the night
Memories of your taste, I've been holding on tight
Falling apart and I'm living a lie
All of this time
I've been loving a liar

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh
Am I going under?
Ooh-ooh
Should my heart surrender?
Ooh-ooh (Ooh)
Am I going under?
Ooh-ooh
Should my heart surrender?

[Bridge]
Am I going under?
Should this heart surrender?
Ooh-ooh
Am I going under?
Ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
I've been left in the dark
Standing cold in the night
Memories of your taste, I've been holding on tight
Falling apart and I'm living a lie
All of this time
I've been loving a liar

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh
Am I going under?
Ooh-ooh
Should my heart surrender?
Ooh-ooh (Ooh)
Am I going under?
Ooh-ooh
Should my heart surrender?2Embed
