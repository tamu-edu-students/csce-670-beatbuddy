I should set you free
I, I should defend you
I should let this be

I keep on slippin' away
I keep on, keep on slippin' away
I keep on slippin' away
I keep on, keep on slippin' away

I, I can't escape you
I should let this breathe
I, I can't commit to
I can help you see

I keep on slippin' away
I keep on, keep on slippin' away
I keep on slippin' away
I keep on, keep on slippin' away

I just wanna be what you deserve
Know I gotta show what you are worth
All I wanna do is make it work with you
I just wanna be what you deserve
Know I gotta show what you are worth
All I wanna do is make it work with you
