I didn't see it coming (Coming)
But I never really had much faith
In the universe's magic (Magic), oh, no
Till it pulled us to that time and place
And I'll never forget
When the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
It still has me choking; it's hard to explain
I know you know me, you don't have to show me
I, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain

[Chorus]
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue

[Verse 2]
And yeah, I could be punching
But I always tend to fluctuate
And I feel sick that I'm buzzing, oh, love, I'm in trouble
I'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place
I never wanna get wet
But I think we're chosen like our fates were woven
And all of those bad choices were left turns on the way
You might also like[Chorus]
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue

[Bridge]
I think best way to explain, it's like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, kinda like that, but a little more (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, all makes sense, right? Like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Like (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue21Embed
