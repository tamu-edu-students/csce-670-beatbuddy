18 ContributorsOne Last Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby girl when was it that you had decided
Oh, you’d call it off and on
You were just having fun
With loving one last time

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I’d catch you when the days through
At my side passing by
Wishin' someday you’d make up your mind

[Chorus]
Alone, alone again on valentine
Oh, alone, alone again on valentine

[Verse 2]
Honey bee was it your buzzin’ I adored?
You’ve stung me twice before
I kept coming back
Kept coming back for more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Always reminded
Of the days when
You were my
Cherry lime
(My cherry lime)
Finding our own worlds getting lost
You and I
You might also like(Long gone an) Old friend of mine
A blue moons on the rise
No one I'd rather have
Beside me tonight

[Chorus]
Oh, alone, alone again on valentine
Oh, oh, oh
Alone, alone again on valentine11Embed
