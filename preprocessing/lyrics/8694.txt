1 ContributorUnderwater Lyrics[Intro]
You will never know who stays and gonna go
I said before, it's better to be alone
I told you so you need to let it go
'Cause I hink it won’t be forever more

[Chorus]
It comes and it goes like the water in the sea
Don’t be too close they’ll try running free
I’m seeing those saving everything they’ve got
Keep your head under water and forget what they said
When the water around me bursts to colours
I know where I belong
And when thе waves are wrapped around my shouldеrs
I know where I belong, oh its where I belong
Oh its where I belong
Oh its where I belong
And every word you meant was not enough
And every time we talked but we don’t trust
And I see the signs they are running through my mind
But how many times, do we need to say goodbye?
It comes and it goes like the water in the sea
Don’t be too close they’ll try running free
I’m seeing those saving everything they’ve got
Keep your head under water and forget what they said
When the water around me bursts to colours
I know where I belong, Oh its where I belong
And when the waves are wrapped around my shoulders
I know where I belong, Oh its where I belong
Oh its where I belong
Oh its where I belong
And when the water around me bursts to colours
I know where I belong, Oh its where I belong
And when the waves are wrapped around my shoulders
I know where I belong, oh its where I belongYou might also likeEmbed
