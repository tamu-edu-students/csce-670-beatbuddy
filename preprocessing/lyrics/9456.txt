7 Contributors​vulnerable Lyrics[Verse 1]
You’ve seen me like nobody’s ever seen me before
(Before)
You’ve seen me as I'm stumbling my way through the door (Through the door)
This liquor got me floating on some other plane
(Plane)
The room’s spinning around but you’re my gravity
(Ay, gravity)

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m saying words that I shouldn’t say out loud
And in your eyes, all the lights look like stars
I want that high while my drinks spillin' love
But, you’ve cut me open and I’m bleeding out

[Chorus]
Baby, (Baby) I’m falling into pieces in front of you
(Front of you)
My baby he’s seen me
So vulnerable
So vulnerable
And I’m wasted (And I'm wasted)
Spilling my secrets (My secrets)
And baby, (Baby)
I’m crying in this club I won’t lie to you
I’m falling so hard with no parachute
So vulnerable
So vulnerable
You might also like[Verse 2]
Don’t expect to see you here, it’s not your typical crowd
(Crowd)
And if you see me on the street tomorrow, don’t bring this up
(Bring this up)
And it’s so pathetic, the way that I am
Can’t help but feel I lost the only chance I had
What do you think about me, think about me now? (Me now)
Me now?

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m saying words that I shouldn’t say out loud
(I say it though)
And in your eyes, all the lights look like stars
(There's so many stars)
I want that high while my drinks spillin' love
(Spillin' love)
But, you’ve cut me open and I’m bleeding out
(Ooh)

[Chorus]
Baby, (Baby) I’m falling into pieces in front of you
(Front of you)
My baby he’s seen me
So vulnerable (Vulnerable)
So vulnerable (So vulnerable)
And I’m wasted (And I'm wasted)
Spilling my secrets (My secrets)
And baby, (Baby)
I’m crying in this club I won’t lie to you
(I won't lie to you)
I’m falling so hard with no parachute
So vulnerable (So vulnerable)
So vulnerable
[Outro]
Kinda told him that I loved him in a haste
Tried to take it back, but it was way too late
I’ll never forget the look of pity on his face
Oh, I’ve been feeling so vulnerable
Yeah, I’ve been feeling so vulnerable
Oh, I’ve been feeling so vulnerable
Yeah, I’ve been feeling so vulnerable3Embed
