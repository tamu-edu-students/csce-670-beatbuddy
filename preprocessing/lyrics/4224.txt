Hoo-ooh
Ohh-ohh
Mmm-mmm

[Verse 1]
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, "Sonny, move out to the country"
Ah but workin' too hard can give you a heart attack
Ack-ack-ack-ack-ack

[Pre-Chorus]
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get for your money?

[Chorus]
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out, mmm mm
Ooh-ooh, uh-huh, mmm

Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr. Cacciatore's
Down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah, and he's tradin' in his Chevy
For a Cadillac-ac-ac-ac-ac-ac

[Pre-Chorus]
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
And if he can't drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

[Chorus]
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
Mmm, I'm movin' out
Oh-ohh, ooh ooh, uh-huh, mmm

[Verse 3]
You should never argue
With a crazy mind-mind-mind-mind-mind-mind
[Pre-Chorus]
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money?

[Chorus]
And if that's what you have in mind
Yeah, if that's what you're all about
Good luck movin' up, 'cause I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out

[Outro]
I'm movin' out22Embed
