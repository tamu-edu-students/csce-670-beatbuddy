3 ContributorsClose to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Unproud of the things I do
Maybe I'm a fool
I don’t deserve this
The things that you do
Maybe you're the fool
You don't deserve me
At my best
Even through my worst
You should be here
But your presence remains distant

[Chorus]
You’re so close to me
Yet you don't even know me
Back and forth you play pretend
These games you play they never end
I'm trying my best to hold up my defense
What can I do to understand?
Wondering where your love has went

[Verse 2]
Too difficult
Saying what's on my mind
But easy for me to trust in words
Most of the time
And I...
Just wanna be loved, wanna be loved, wanna be loved by you
You might also like[Chorus]
And you're so close to me
Yet you don't even know me
Back and forth you play pretend
These games you play they never end
I'm trying my best to hold up my defense
What can I do to understand?
Wondering where your love has went

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wish that we were just a little bit closer
Someday I hope you'll let me lay my head on your shoulder
They say you’ll know a little better when you grow older
But all we got’s a love that only seems to get colder

[Chorus]
And you're so close to me
Yet you don’t even know me
Back and forth you play pretend
These games you play they never end
I'm trying my best to hold up my defense
What can I do to understand?
Wondering where your love has went

[Refrain]
You're so close to me
Yet you don't even know me
Back and forth you play pretend
These games you play they never end
I’m trying my best to hold up my defense
What can I do to understand?
Wondering where your love has went2Embed
