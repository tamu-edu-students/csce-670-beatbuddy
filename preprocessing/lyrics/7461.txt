(If it ain't love)

[Verse 1]
Red wine, take out
Our clothes on the floor
That we can
On the background (dida-dida)
She found your way out
When we get too close
And now I gotta know, I gotta know

[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'ma waiting for
Will waiting for your heart
Help, let's keep it us, let's keep it us apart
Help, I've been waiting long
Been waiting long enough
So I gotta now (I gotta now)

[Chorus]
If it ain't love, if it ain't love
Why do your heart go bum-bum-dida-didadi-dum-dum?
If it ain't love, if it ain't love
Why does your heart go bum-bum-dida-didadi-dum-dum-didadi-dadi-dum?
