17 ContributorsSwim and Sleep (Like a Shark) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide 'til the end of time
In that sweet cool darkness
Asleep and constantly floating away

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could break and mend like the world does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd chase all my dreams away
And I'd let you crush me
My dreams would be constantly melting away

[Verse 1]
I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide 'til the end of time
In that sweet cool darkness
Asleep and constantly floating awaySee Unknown Mortal Orchestra LiveGet tickets as low as $65You might also like18Embed
