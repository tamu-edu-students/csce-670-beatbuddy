Oh, for sixteen years it was me and my mum
Pickin' me up when I cried
And it hurts like hell, every day that you're gone
Another part of me dies

[Pre-Chorus]
Yesterday, we were nothin' but strangers
Now you're standin' there at the door
How I hate that I look like your daughter
Can't look in the mirror no more

[Chorus]
I don't wanna cry these tears with my daddy's eyes
Turn up after all these years just to say goodbye, oh no
All the birthdays are the worst days
Every Christmas you were missin'
All the nights you never sang me to sleep
I don't wanna cry these tears with my daddy's eyes
Not tonight, no, not tonight

[Verse 2]
How come every other kid had a father
Picking them up after school?
I got history that you weren't part of
Where the hell were you?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Yesterday, we were nothin' but strangers
Now you're standin' there at the door
How I hate that I look like your daughter
Can't look in the mirror no more

[Chorus]
I don't wanna cry these tears with my daddy's eyes (With my daddy's eyes, with my daddy's eyes)
Turn up after all these years just to say goodbye (Just to say goodbye), oh no
All the birthdays are the worst days
Every Christmas you were missin'
All the nights you never sang me to sleep
I don't wanna cry these tears with my daddy's eyes
Not tonight

[Bridge]
Now that I'm eighteen, I'm learnin' to make it
Livin' is better without you
Bryan, Magdaline, Chloe, Hillary
Don't have to feel the way I do
Now that I'm eighteen, I'm learnin' to make it
Livin' is better without you, without you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna cry these tears with my daddy's eyes (With my daddy's eyes, with my daddy's eyes)
Turn up after all these years just to say goodbye (Just to say goodbye), oh no
All the birthdays are the worst days
Every Christmas you were missin'
All the nights you never sang me to sleep
I don't wanna cry these tears with my daddy's eyes
Not tonight, no, not tonight8Embed
