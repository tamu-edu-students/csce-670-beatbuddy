Despite the lies that you're making
Your love is mine for the taking
My love is just waiting
To turn your tears to roses

[Verse 1]
Despite the lies that you're making
Your love is mine for the taking
My love is just waiting
To turn your tears to roses
I will be the one that's gonna hold you
I will be the one that you run to
My love is a burning, consuming fire

[Chorus]
No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
I'll light the night with stars
Hear my whispers in the dark
No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
You know I'm never far
Hear my whispers in the dark
Whispers in the dark

You feel so lonely and ragged
You lay here broken and naked
My love is just waiting
To clothe you in crimson roses
I will be the one that's gonna find you
I will be the one that's gonna guide you
My love is a burning, consuming fire

[Chorus]
No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
I'll light the night with stars
Hear my whispers in the dark
No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
You know I'm never far
Hear the whispers in the dark

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
I'll light the night with stars
Hear my whispers in the dark
No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
You know I'm never far
Hear the whispers in the dark
Whispers in the dark
Whispers in the dark
