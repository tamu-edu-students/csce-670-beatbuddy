[Verse]
When I am down
And, oh, my soul, so weary
When troubles come
And my heart burdened be
Then, I am still and wait here
In the silence
Until you come
And sit awhile with me

[Chorus]
You raise me up
So I can stand on mountains
You raise me up
To walk on stormy seas
I am strong
When I am on your shoulders
You raise me up
To more than I can be

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You raise me up
So I can stand on mountains
You raise me up
To walk on stormy seas
I am strong
When I am on your shoulders
You raise me up
To more than I can be
You raise me up (Up)
So I can stand on mountains (Can stand on mountains)
You raise me up
To walk on stormy seas (Stormy seas)
I am strong (I am strong)
When I am on your shoulders (Ooh-ooh)
You raise me up
To more than I can be
You raise me up (Up)
So I can stand on mountains (Can stand on mountains)
You raise me up
To walk on stormy seas (Stormy seas)
I am strong
When I am on your shoulders
You raise me up
To more than I can be

To more than I can be12Embed
