5 ContributorsI Should Have Walked Away LyricsOh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should have walked away, I should have walked away

I should have walked away


Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should have walked away, I should have walked away

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary it sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I just died in your arms tonight

It must've been some kind of kiss
I should have walked away, I should have walked away

I should have walked away

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should have walked away, I should have walked away2Embed
