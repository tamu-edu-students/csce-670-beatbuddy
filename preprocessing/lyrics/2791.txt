Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them
You're grown (you're grown up), so grown (so grown up)
Now I must say more than ever (come on, Eileen)
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye

Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (well, he means)
At this moment
You mean everything (everything)
You in that dress
My thoughts, I confess

They're resigned to what their fate is
But not us (no, never)

Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever

Oh, ah, Eileen, said
Come on, Eileen
These things, they are real (come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
And I know how you feel (come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
Now I must say, more than ever (toora, toora, ta-loora)
Things 'round here have changed, I said
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye (come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye, toora, toora, ta-loora)
