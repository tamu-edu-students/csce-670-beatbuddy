7 ContributorsI won’t let you feel alone again Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah ooooh

[Chorus]
Yeah turn out all the lights, baby it's just you and me now
Stay up every night, we don't ever need to sleep now
You got me feeling right when I need to be
Baby want guys, show me that you need me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been thinking 'bout you lately
Girl I know you want to
You can always slide by my place
You got my heart burning out babe
Every single time I lay my eyes on your face
I'm falling for your body and your mind too
Forget the past we can leave it all behind you
I won't let you feel alone again
I won't let you feel alone again

[Pre-Chorus]
With your hair between my fingers
I don't ever wanna let go
Yeah, I'm mesmerized by your figure
Never get tired of you at all
Baby girl you should come through
We can do whatever you want to
Just sit back and let me love you

[Verse 2]
Put your body up against mine
Couple hours we never look at the time
Laying in bed as we watching the sun shine
Through the curtains and passing the window blinds, yeah
And you're so warm, in the middle of a winter night
So glad that I made you mine, I feel fine with you besides me

[Pre-Chorus]
With your hair between my fingers
I don't ever wanna let go
Yeah, I'm mesmerized by your figure
Never get tired of you at all
Baby girl you should come through
We can do whatever you want to
Just sit back and let me love you

[Chorus]
Yeah turn out all the lights, baby it's just you and me now
Stay up every night, we don't ever need to sleep now
You got be feeling right when I need to be
Baby want guys, show me that you need meEmbed
