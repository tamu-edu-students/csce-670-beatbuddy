Well, she's all you'd ever want
She's the kind I'd like to flaunt and take to dinner
Well, she always knows her place
She's got style, she's got grace, she's a winner

[Chorus]
She's a lady
Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady
Talkin' about that little lady
And the lady is mine

[Verse 2]
Well, she's never in the way
Always something nice to say, oh, what a blessing
I can leave her on her own
Knowing she's okay alone, and there's no messing

[Chorus]
She's a lady
Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady
Talkin' about that little lady
And the lady is mine

[Bridge]
Well, she never asks for very much, and I don't refuse her
Always treat her with respect, I never would abuse her
What she's got is hard to find, and I don't want to lose her
Help me build a mountain from my little pile of clay
Hey, hey, hey

Well, she knows what I'm about
She can take what I dish out, and that's not easy
Well, she knows me through and through
And she knows just what to do, and how to please me

[Chorus]
She's a lady
Oh, whoa, whoa, she's a lady
Talkin' about that little lady
And the lady is mine

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, she's a lady
Oh, whoa, whoa, she's a lady
Listen to me people, she's a lady
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, she's a lady
Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady
Talkin' about the little Lady
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady

Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's a lady
Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady
I can't live without that little lady
Ooh-ooh, ooh, she's a lady1Embed
