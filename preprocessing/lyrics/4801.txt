(Tell me now, how should I fee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee)

[Verse 1]
How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

[Verse 2]
I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tеll me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand hеre waiting

Now I stand here waiting
(Fire!)
(Fire!)
(Fire!)
(Fire!)
(Fire!)
(Geisha!)
(Geisha!)

[Verse 3]
I thought I told you to leave me
When I walked down to the beach
Tell me, how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?Embed
