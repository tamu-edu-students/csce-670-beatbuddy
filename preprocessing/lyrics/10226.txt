21 ContributorsLittle Swing Lyrics[Verse 1: Little Sis Nora]
Her knees, feet and elbow work their thing into a mamba
The scene starts to crumble to the sound of the drums
Oh boy, there ain't no need to buy that diamond ring

[Chorus: Little Sis Nora]
It ain't no big thing
Just show her a little swing

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Little Sis Nora]
No care about the bling bling, bro, there ain't nothing to do
Oh, man, soon it's over and you'll sing the walkin' blues
So boy, there ain't no need to buy that diamond ring

[Chorus: Little Sis Nora]
It ain't no big thing
Just show her a little swing

[Instrumental]

[Post-Chorus: AronChupa]
(I'm gonna look for a new job)

[Instrumental]

When you're up...
When you're down...
And there ain't no love around
There's a place for you, my friend
There's a way for you, my friend
Just show her some swing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing-wing…

[Chorus: Little Sis Nora]
It ain't no big thing
But you know what
Just show her a little swing

[Instrumental]

[Post-Chorus: AronChupa]
(I'm gonna look for a new job)
