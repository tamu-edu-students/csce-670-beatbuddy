2 ContributorsAway From Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
Working in my castle
Miss the smile that she wore
Fighting in that battle
'Till I head back to shore
Leaving in the God’s hands
The day of the harvest
Working on my good plans
But they’re kind of the hardest

[Chorus]
And I’ve been away way
Far away from home
And I’ve been away way
Far from them
And I’ve been away way
Far away from home
And I’ve been away way
Far too long

[Post-Chorus]
Mmmmm, mmmmm
Way far away from home
Mmmmm, mmmmm
Way far away from home
You might also like[Verse 2]
Dreaming in my car like
Big moves quiet wins
Wearing all my scars like
They’re part of my wings
Wondering where they are
It pulls on my heartstrings
Speeding up my drive like
Big moviеs on the screens

[Chorus]
And I’ve been away way
Far away from home
And I’vе been away way
Far from them
And I’ve been away way
Far away from home
And I’ve been away way
Far too long

[Post-Chorus]
Mmmmm, mmmmm
Way far away from home
Mmmmm, mmmmm
Way far away from home
Way far away from home1Embed
