71 ContributorsAlien Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
Was it the best you ever had?
Was it the worst? You'd never know
I'd try to tell you what I think and play it off like it's a joke
Oh no, more surprises, guess it's like this
I'd do anything for you, Mrs. Highness

[Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
The sun is fun, the land is dandy
I only talk to dogs because they don't understand me
My teeth are yellow, hello world
Would you like me a little better if they were white like yours?
I need to purge my urges, shame, shame, shame
I need an alibi to justify, somebody to blame
It's a halibut, "party bitch", give it a name and say, "Hey, hey"
