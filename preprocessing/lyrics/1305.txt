6 ContributorsI Remember Lyrics[Intro]
Mm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
We stayed up all night long
Drink your roommate's alcohol
But I don't think we ever payed her back
Sharin' Swisher Sweets
Yeah, and all our crazy dreams
I kinda miss the days that felt like that

[Pre-Chorus]
Two first-time hearts
Lookin' back, baby, we were clueless
But we fell so hard
Like we knew what we were doin'

[Chorus]
And I remember the nights when we
Were young, dumb, and wild, and free
When I close my eyes, I can see you in my sweatshirt
Dancin' 'round that college bar
These days, I don't know where you are
But I get to keep these memories forever
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I remember, oh
I remember, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
I still can't hear Third Eye Blind
Without thinkin' 'bout that night
We bought lawn seats, but we never made it in
'Cause we couldn't stop makin' out
On the hood of that Chevy Stepside
And we sang, "Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo"
While spinnin' you in those headlights

[Chorus]
I remember the nights when we
Were young, dumb, and wild, and free
When I close my eyes, I can see you in my sweatshirt
Dancin' 'round that college bar
These days, I don't know where you are
But I get to keep these memories forever

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I remember, oh
I remember, mm (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Two first-time hearts
Lookin' back, baby, we were clueless
But we fell so hard
Like we knew what we were doin'
[Chorus]
And I remember the nights when we
Were young, dumb, and wild, and free
When I close my eyes, I can see you in my sweatshirt
Dancin' 'round that college bar
These days, I don't know where you are
But I get to keep these memories forever

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I remember, yes, I do
I remember, mm
Dancin' 'round that college bar
These days, I don't know where you are
But I get to keep these memories forever
Oh, I rememberEmbed
