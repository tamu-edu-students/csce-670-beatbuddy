Who is this irresistible creature who has an insatiable love for the dead?
Living Dead Girl!

[Pre-Verse]
"What are you thinking about?
What are you thinking about?"
"The same thing you are"

[Verse 1]
Rage in the cage
And piss upon the stage
There's only one sure way
To bring the giant down
Defunct the strings
Of cemetery things
With one flat foot
On the devil's wing

[Chorus 1]
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living Dead Girl
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living Dead Girl

"What are you thinking about?
What are you thinking about?"
"The same thing you are"

[Verse 2]
Raping the geek
And hustling the freak
Like a hunchback juice
On a sentimental noose
Operation filth
They love to love the wealth
Of an SS whore
Making scary sounds

[Chorus 1]
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living Dead Girl
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living Dead Girl

[Pre-Verse]
"What are you thinking about?"
[Verse 3]
Psyclone jack
Hallucinating hack
Thinks that Donna Reed
Eats dollar bills
Goldfoot's machine
Creates another fiend
So beautiful
They make you kill

[Chorus 1]
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living Dead Girl
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living Dead Girl

[Chorus 2]
Blood on her skin
Dripping with sin
Do it again
Living Dead Girl
Blood on her skin
Dripping with sin
Do it again
