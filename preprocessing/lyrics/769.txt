I don't practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball
Well, I had a million dollars, but I'd, I'd spend it all
If I could find that jaina and that Sancho that she's found
Well, I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd slap her down

[Chorus]
What I really wanna know, ah, baby, mmm
What I really want to say, I can't define
Well, it's love that I need, oh

Daddy's gonna love one and all

[Chorus]
What I really wanna know, ah, baby
What I really want to say, I can't define
That love, make it go

And I'll make it, oh yes, I'm comin' up"

If he knows what is good for him, he best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new .45

What I really wanna know, my baby
Ooh, what I really wanna say is, "There's just one"
Way back, and I'll make it, oh yeah I'm coming up
My soul will have to wait yeah

[Outro]
