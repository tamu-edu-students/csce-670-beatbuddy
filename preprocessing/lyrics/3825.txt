2 ContributorsIf You Had My Love LyricsIf you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, bae

If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

You said you want my love and you've got to have it all
But first, there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you trying to get with me
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
What would you do? Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?Embed
