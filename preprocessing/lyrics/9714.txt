14 ContributorsWhere I Belong Lyrics[Verse 1: Pierre Bouvier]
I'm looking in the rearview mirror
Everything looks the same
There's nothing but broken streetlights
And I'm just trying to escape
I'm waiting on a distant feeling
I'm waiting for things to change
It's getting hard to ride on empty
But maybe I'm not so far away
'Cause it feels like home

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier]
I found a reason
And suddenly I'm not so alone
I'm finally breathing
Like I never could on my own
Start the countdown, let's get it on
Scream our lungs out to our favorite song
'Cause this is where I belong
(This is where I belong)

[Verse 2: Pierre Bouvier & Derek DiScanio]
I can tell you just don't get it
And that you'll never understand
I'm sorry that I can't be perfect
But I'm not changing who I am
Maybe there's no destination
Maybe I'm gonna make mistakes
Let you in on one of my secrets
I'm still just as lost as yesterday
But it feels like home
You might also like[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier & Derek DiScanio]
I found a reason
And suddenly I'm not so alone
I'm finally breathing
Like I never could on my own
Start the countdown, let's get it on
Scream our lungs out to our favorite song
'Cause this is where I belong

[Bridge: Travis Clark]
Look past the warning signs
The same ones that told me
I should just turn back and run
"Play it safe before you come undone"
If you saw through my eyes
This view is worth the time
Believe me when I say
There's no place in this world I'd rather be

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier, Derek DiScanio & Travis Clark]
I found a reason
And suddenly I'm not so alone
I'm finally breathing
Like I never could on my own
Start the countdown, let's get it on
Scream our lungs out to our favorite song (Favorite song)
'Cause this is where I belong
I found a reason (I found a reason)
And suddenly I'm not so alone
I'm finally breathing (I'm finally breathing)
Like I never could on my own
Start the countdown, let's get it on
Scream our lungs out to our favorite song (Favorite song)
'Cause this is where I belong
[Outro]
('Cause this is where I belong)
'Cause this is where I belong1Embed
