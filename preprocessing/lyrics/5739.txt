41 ContributorsNightrain Lyrics[Intro]
Loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane
Feelin' like a space brain
One more time tonight, look out

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a west coast struttin'
One bad mother
Got a rattlesnake suitcase under my arm
Said, I'm a mean machine, been drinkin' gasoline
And, honey, you can make my motor hum
Well, I got one chance left in a nine lives cat
I got a, a dog-eat-dog sly smile
I got a Molotov cocktail with a match to go
I smoke my cigarette with style
And I can tell you, honey, you can make my money tonight, rrah

[Verse 2]
Wake up late, honey, put on your clothes
And take your credit card to the liquor store
Well, that's one for you and two for me by tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane
Feelin' like a space brain
One more time tonight
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm on the nightrain, bottoms up
I'm on the nightrain, fill my cup
I'm on the nightrain, ready to crash and burn
I never learn
I'm on the nightrain, I love that stuff
I'm on the nightrain, and I can never get enough
I'm on the nightrain, never to return, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane
Speedin' like a space brain
One more time tonight

[Chorus]
I'm on the nightrain, and I'm lookin' for some
I'm on the nightrain, so I can leave this slum
I'm on the nightrain, and I'm ready to crash and burn
Nightrain, bottoms up
I'm on the nightrain, fill my cup
I'm on the nightrain, ah, ah, ah, ah, woah, yeah
I'm on the nightrain, love that stuff
Oh, I'm on the nightrain, and I can never get enough
Ridin' the nightrain, I guess, I
I guess, I guess, I guess, I never learn
On the nightrain, float me home
Oh, I'm on the nightrain
Ridin' the nightrain, never to return
Nightrain
