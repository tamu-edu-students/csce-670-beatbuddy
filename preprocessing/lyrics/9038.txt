I'm in no rush to get older
Don't need to know who I'm gonna be
Feels like life is getting shorter
Comes and goes like lightning
Too blessed to be worried
Don't need the feeling of regret
Everybody has a story
And ours hasn't started yet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing to analyze
What are the chances we'd meet in this life

[Chorus]
Chainsaw couldn't split us up
Nothing's gonna wake me up
I'm falling asleep
With you lying next to me
Chainsaw couldn't split us up
Nothing's gonna wake me up
Not even the thunder
Not even the lightning
Chainsaw couldn't split us up
Nothing's gonna wake me up
I'm falling asleep
With you lying next to me
Chainsaw couldn't split us up
Nothing's gonna wake me up
Not even the thunder
Not even the lightning
Not even the thunder
Not even the lightning

Too blessed to be worried
Doesn't matter where you're from
Everybody has a story
We're all staring at the storm

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing to analyze
What are the chances we'd meet in this life

[Chorus]
Chainsaw couldn't split us up
Nothing's gonna wake me up
I'm falling asleep
With you lying next to me
Chainsaw couldn't split us up
Nothing's gonna wake me up
Not even the thunder
Not even the lightning
Chainsaw couldn't split us up
Nothing's gonna wake me up
I'm falling asleep
With you lying next to me
Chainsaw couldn't split us up
Nothing's gonna wake me up
Not even the thunder
Not even the lightning
Not even the thunder
Not even the lightningEmbed
