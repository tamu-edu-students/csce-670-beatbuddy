21 ContributorsPressure Lyrics[Verse 1]
You have to learn to pace yourself
Pressure
You're just like everybody else
Pressure

[Chorus]
You've only had to run so far so good
But you will come to a place
Where the only thing you feel
Are loaded guns in your face
And you'll have to deal with
Pressure

[Verse 2]
You used to call me paranoid
Pressure
But even you can not avoid
Pressure

[Chorus]
You turned the tap dance
Into your crusade
Now here you are with your faith
And your Peter Pan advice
You have no scars on your face
And you cannot handle
Pressure

All grown up and no place to go
Psych 1, Psych 2
What do you know?
All your life is Channel 13
Sesame Street
What does it mean?
I'll tell you what it means
Pressure, pressure

[Verse 3]
Don't ask for help, you're all alone
Pressure
You'll have to answer to your own
Pressure

[Chorus]
I'm sure you'll have
Some cosmic rationale
But here you are in the ninth
Two men out and three men on
Nowhere to look but inside
Where we all respond to
Pressure

[Bridge]
All your life is Time Magazine
I read it, too
What does it mean?
Pressure
[Chorus]
I'm sure you'll have
Some cosmic rationale
Now here you are with your faith
And your Peter Pan advice
You have no scars on your face
And you cannot handle
Pressure

[Outro]
Pressure, pressure
One, two, three, four, pressure!2Embed
