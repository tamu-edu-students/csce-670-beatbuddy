33 ContributorsI Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams Lyrics[Verse 1: Rachel Haden]
I'm so tall, can't get over me
I'm so low, can't get underneath
I must be all these things
For I just threw out the love of my dreams

[Chorus: Rachel Haden]
He's in my eyes, he is in my ears
He's in my blood, he is in my tears
I breathe love and see him every day
Even though my love is a world away

[Post-Chorus: Rachel Haden & Rivers Cuomo]
Oh, he's got me wondering
My righteousness is crumbling

[Verse 2: Rachel Haden]
Never before have I felt this way
I know what is right, but want for him to stay
I must be made of steel
For I just threw out the love of my dreams

[Chorus: Rachel Haden]
He's in my eyes, he is in my ears
He's in my blood, he is in my tears
I breathe love and see him every day
Even though my love is a world away
