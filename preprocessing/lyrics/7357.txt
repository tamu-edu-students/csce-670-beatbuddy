Trudging through the morning
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm
Shifts past your whiskers, so stark is the charm

And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round
In your muddy mind, blatantly caked and

Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale

Trailing wrapped in a gasp

[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall14Embed
