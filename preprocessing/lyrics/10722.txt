31 ContributorsShe Used to Be Mine Lyrics[JENNA]
It's not simple to say
That most days, I don't recognize me
That these shoes, and this apron
That place, and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them

It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be, although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
But I still remember that girl

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine

And it's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a back door
And carves out a person
And makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you
You might also likeYou're not what I asked for
If I'm honest, I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
For that girl that I knew

Who was reckless just enough
Who gets hurt
But who learns how to toughen up when she's bruised
And gets used by a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Getting stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine
Oh, used to be mine

She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine10Embed
