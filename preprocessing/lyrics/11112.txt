8 ContributorsTwo-Timing Touch and Broken Bones Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's official
Full judicial
Ends in physical
This I know
Best keep quiet
You don't listen to me anyway
You're going to lose and it's going to show
It's far too late to avoid it so

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what's that sum?
It added up to nothing 'cause you're much too dumb

[Chorus]
Two-timing touch and broken bones
Two-timing touch and broken bones
Two-timing touch and broken bones
Two-timing touch and broken -

[Verse 2]
Bad decision
Repetition
Should you listen
Or let it go
Uh!
Best say something
When you're thinking that you'll get it back
But it's too late to avoid it so
It's far too late and I got to know

Oh, what's that sum?
It added up to nothing 'cause you're much too dumb

[Chorus]
Two-timing touch and broken bones
Two-timing touch and broken bones
Two-timing touch and broken bones
Two-timing touch and broken bones
Two-timing touch and broken bones
Two-timing touch and broken bones
Two-timing touch and broken bones
Two-timing touch and broken bonesEmbed
