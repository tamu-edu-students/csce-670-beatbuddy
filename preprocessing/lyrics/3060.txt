I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've learned
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea, yeah
You can see a life out the window, tonight

[Chorus 1: Ryan Tedder]
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I'll lose myself tonight
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight

[Instrumental Build-up & Drop]

[Verse 2: Ryan Tedder]
I woke up with the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've learned
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea, yeah
You can see a life out the window, tonight

[Chorus 2: Ryan Tedder]
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I'll lose myself tonight
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight (A woo hooo)
