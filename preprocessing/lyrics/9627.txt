1 ContributorEnchained on the Pain Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been smoking all of my pain
Anxiety it's fucking my brain
No have a reason to wake
I smile but always it's fake

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tied all the remembers of my past
The time it really pass so fast
Many thoughts on my head, feel so bad
I can't more

[Chorus]
Nobody can see
The pain inside of me
All my broken dreams
Anxiety is ending with me
I've lost the faith
I'm here enchained
I'm a loser with this pain
This song is what I really feel
Forever I'll be enchained on the pain

[Verse 2]
I feel I'm wasting my time
I feel I'm wasting my life
I fight with this everynight
I live a mess on my mind
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm fallin' I'm depressed again
Hapiness is so far away
I'm lonely crying in the rain
I'm not okay

[Chorus]
Nobody can see
The pain inside of me
All my broken dreams
Anxiety is ending with me
I've lost the faith
I'm here enchained
I'm a loser with this pain
This song is what I really feel
Forever I'll be enchained on the pain

[Bridge]
What I made?
What's my mistake?
Since the first day
Was a mistake
Enchained
To all my sins
Living with pain
Living with pain
What I made?
What's my mistake?
Since the first day
Was a mistake
Enchained
To all my sins
Living with pain
[Chorus]
Nobody can see
The pain inside of me
All my broken dreams
Anxiety is ending with me
I've lost the faith
I'm here enchained
I'm a loser with this pain
This song is what I really feel
Forever I'll be enchained on the pain

[Outro]
Please save me, I'm so fucked up
Please help me, I'm stuck up
Please save me, I'm so fucked up
Please help me, I'm stuck up
I'm sickEmbed
