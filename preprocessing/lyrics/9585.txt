41 ContributorsSex and Candy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hanging around, downtown by myself
And I had so much time to sit and think about myself
And then there she was, like double cherry pie
Yeah, there she was, like disco super-fly

[Chorus]
I smell sex and candy here, mmm
Who's that lounging in my chair? Mmm
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
Momma this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, momma this surely is a dream, dig it

[Verse 2]
Hanging around, downtown by myself
And I've had too much caffeine, and I was thinking about myself
And then there she was, in platform double suede
Yeah, there she was, like disco lemonade

[Chorus]
I smell sex and candy here, mmhmmm
Who's that lounging in my chair? Mmhmmm
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
Momma this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, momma this surely is a dream, dig it
Yeah, momma this surely is a dream, yeah

Who's that lounging in my chair? Mmhmmm
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
Momma this surely, is a dream, yeah
Yeah, momma this surely is a dream, dig it
Yeah, momma this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, momma this must be my dream19Embed
