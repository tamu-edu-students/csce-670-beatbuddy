15 ContributorsCome and Get It Lyrics[Intro: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Eric Vanlerberghe and Brian Burkheiser]
Every single time I turn around, my name is in your mouth
Soon you'll see, you can say what you want, you'll never be me
I'll just bite my tongue and leave your mouth to run
Soon you'll see; if you want it, come get it, you know where I'll be

[Pre-Chorus 1: Eric Vanlerberghe]
If you want it, come get it, you know where I'll be
If you want it, come get it, you know where I'll be

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser and Eric Vanlerberghe]
Look at you now, another face in the crowd
I am, I am the headline
Look in my eyes and read between the lines
I am, I am the headline

[Post-Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe and Brian Burkheiser]
I am, I am, I am the headline
I am, I am, I am the headline

[Verse 2: Eric Vanlerberghe and Brian Burkheiser]
Deep down I love it when you hate me
Keep it up, it's funny that you can't see
This is everything you wanted to be
So give up, give up, feed your hate to me
I'll just bite my tongue (My tongue)
And leave your mouth to run (To run)
This is everything you wanted to be
So give up, give up, feed your hate to me

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser and Eric Vanlerberghe]
Look at you now, another face in the crowd
I am, I am the headline
Look in my eyes and read between the lines
I am, I am the headline

[Bridge: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Take a look around, tell me what you see
The wolves are out, it's about to get rowdy, go
Welcome to our stomping grounds
Where the kids throw down and the shit gets loud
This is an invitation to get the fuck out if you can't take it

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser and Eric Vanlerberghe]
Look at you now, another face in the crowd
I am, I am the headline
Look in my eyes, and read between the lines
I am, I am the headline

[Post-Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe & Brian Burkheiser]
I am, I am, I am the headline
I am, I am, I am the headline3Embed
