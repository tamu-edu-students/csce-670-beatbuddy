1 ContributorProfite (Kazy Lambist Remix) LyricsTurning off my brain as I walk into the club
I feel my feet are moving I can't get enough
Turning off my brain as I walk into the club
I feel my feet are moving I can't get enough

Ooh-oo, ooh-oo, ooh-oo, ooh-oo-ooh

Turning off my brain as I walk into the club
I feel my feet are moving I can't get enough
Stranger warmth I'm feeling
Caught somewhere in between
Another northern lights
And a polar morning

Turning off my brain as I walk into the club
I feel my feet are moving I can't get enough
Stranger warmth I'm feeling
Caught somewhere in between
Another northern lights
And a polar morning

Turning off my brain as I walk into the club
I feel my feet are moving I can't get enough
Turning off my brain as I walk into the club
I feel my feet are moving I can't get enough
Get enough

(Ooh-oo, ooh-oo, ooh-oo, ooh-oo-ooh)
Turning off my brain as I walk into the club
I feel my feet are moving I can't get enough (get enough)
Get enough get enoughEmbed
