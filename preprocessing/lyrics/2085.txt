121 ContributorsUndone (The Sweater Song) Lyrics[Spoken Word: Matt Sharp & Karl Koch]
Oh, hey brah, how we doin' man?
Alright
It's been a while man, life's so rad
This band's my favorite man, don't ya love 'em?
Yeah
Aw man, you want a beer?
Alright
Aw man, hell brah, this is the best man
I'm so glad we're all back together and stuff
This is great, man
Yeah
Hey, did you know about the party after the show?
Yeah
Aw man, it's gonna be the best, I'm so stoked
Take it easy, brah

[Verse 1]
I'm me, me be, goddamn, I am
I can sing and hear me, know me

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away
[Spoken Word: Mykel Allen & Karl Koch]
Hey, what's up?
Not much
Um, did you hear about the party?
Yeah
I think I'm gonna go but, um, my friends don't really wanna go
Could I get a ride?

Oh no, it go, it gone, bye-bye (Bye)
Who I? I think, I sink, and I die

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Outro]
(I don't want to destroy your tank top)
If you want to destroy my sweater
(Let's be friends and just walk away)
Hold this thread as I walk away
(Hate to see you lying there in your Superman skivvies)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone
