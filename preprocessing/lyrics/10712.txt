You say we're somethin’, somethin' or another
Tryna to keep my records straight 'cause it will never be the same
You’re lovely under, tryna to be undercover
I said if you wanna keep your face then you better keep out my way, yeah

Respond (Ew)
Hello (No)
You're saying like, “Don't let go,” you (Yeah)
You said we were hanging out, but
