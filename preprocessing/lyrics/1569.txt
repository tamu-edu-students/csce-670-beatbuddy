Do you hear me? I'm talking to you
Across the water, across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my
Baby, I'm trying
Boy, I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Bridge: Colbie Caillat, Jason Mraz, both]
They don't know how long it takes
(They don't know how long it takes)
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
(Every time we say goodbye)
I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will, I'm

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

[Verse 2: Jason Mraz, Colbie Caillat]
And so, I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
Though the breezes, through the trees
You move so pretty, you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning 'round
You hold me right here, right now

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday
[Outro: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]
