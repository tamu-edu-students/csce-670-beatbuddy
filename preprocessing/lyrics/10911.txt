Open
Living for the night like it is golden
Yeah I came to win, I'm never folding
I just wanna dance among the stars
These afterhours got me charged and
Open
Living for the night like it is golden
Yeah I came to win, I'm never folding
I just wanna dance among the stars
These afterhours got me charged and

I just wanna dance among the stars
I just wanna dance among the stars
These afterhours got me charged
Afterhours got me charged
Afterhours got me charged
Afterhours got me charged

Living for the night like it is golden
Yeah I came to win, I'm never folding
