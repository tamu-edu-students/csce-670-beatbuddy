There's just so much goddamn weight on my shoulders
All I'm tryin' to do is live my motherfuckin' life
Supposed to be happy, but I'm only gettin' colder
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside

[Verse 2]
There's just so much goddamn weight on my shoulders
All I'm tryin' to do is live my motherfuckin' life
Supposed to be happy, but I'm only gettin' colder
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside

[Chorus]
(Oh, yo, yo) There's a demon inside
(Oh, yo, yo) Just like Jekyll and Hyde
(Oh, yo, yo) All this anger inside
(Oh, yo, yo) I feel like Jekyll and Hyde

[Verse 3]
Is there just so much goddamn weight on your shoulders
That you can't just live your motherfuckin' life?
The story's gettin' old and my heart is gettin' colder
I just wanna be Jekyll, but I'm always fuckin' Hyde

[Verse 4]
You got rocks in your head, I can hear them rollin' 'round
You can say that you're above it, but you're always fallin' down
Is there a method to your madness? Is it all about pride?
Seems everyone I know, they got a demon inside

(Oh, yo, yo) There's a demon inside
(Oh, yo, yo) Just like Jekyll and Hyde
(Oh, yo, yo) All this anger inside
(Oh, yo, yo) I feel like Jekyll and Hyde

[Bridge]
If I wasn't so deranged
Could I ever face the pain?
If I ever were to change
Would the song remain the same?

(Oh, yo, yo)
All I'm tryin' to do is live my motherfuckin' life
(Oh, yo, yo)
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside
(Oh, yo, yo)
All I'm tryin' to do is live my motherfuckin' life
(Oh, yo, yo)
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside

[Solo]

[Chorus]
(Oh, yo, yo) There's a demon inside
(Oh, yo, yo) Just like Jekyll and Hyde
(Oh, yo, yo) All this anger inside
(Oh, yo, yo) I feel like Jekyll and Hyde12Embed
