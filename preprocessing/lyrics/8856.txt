2 ContributorsTrip to Mars (Astronauts) Lyrics[Intro]
Explore the galaxy
Astronauts on ecstasy

[Drop]
(Ecstasy)

[Verse]
I was born to be an astronaut
Flying high into space
I don’t have a spaceship
But we found a better way
Always on the weekends
I book my trip to Mars
United with my buddies
We ignite like shooting stars

[Chorus]
Explore the galaxy
Astronauts on ecstasy

[Drop]

[Spoken]
Houston, we have a problem
This is Houston, go ahead
We see an unidentified astronaut flying through space here
Holy shit! This guy is going way too fast
You might also like[Chorus]
Explore the galaxy
Astronauts on ecstasy
