12 ContributorsBroken Heart Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm letting go
'Cause I can't take this anymore
Since you broke my heart in two

[Verse 1]
I've been a little crazy lately
I've been out of my head
I remember every word you ever said
And, oh, I, I never thought you would betray me
A whole lotta regret
I cannot believe we're coming to an end

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you got me feeling so damn low

[Chorus]
I'm letting go
'Cause I can't take this anymore
Since you broke my heart in two
And now I know
That you don't love me anymore
So take my broken heart with you

[Verse 2]
I've been a little lonely lately
I can't sleep in this bed
I remember every night we ever spent
And, oh, I'm hearing every word you told me
It's stuck in my head
All your promises were broken in the end
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And now you got me feeling so damn low

[Chorus]
I'm letting go
'Cause I can't take this anymore
Since you broke my heart in two
And now I know
That you don't love me anymore
So take my broken heart with you

[Bridge]
We could've been something
But now you got me feeling down, down, down
Down, down, down
We could've been something
But now you got me feeling down, down, down
Down, down, down

[Chorus]
I'm letting go
'Cause I can't take this anymore
Since you broke my heart in two
And now I know
That you don't love me anymore
So take my broken heart with you
I'm letting go
'Cause I can't take this anymore
Since you broke my heart in two
And now I know
That you don't love me anymore
So take my broken heart with you1Embed
