5 ContributorsI Just Couldn’t Save You Tonight (Story of Kale - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Lyrics[Verse 1: Ardhito Pramono]
Living with something that I couldn't see
And somehow fade internally
If you came a long way to get to know me
Or maybe it just meant to be?

[Verse 2: Aurelie Moeremans]
Come here I just found a new recipe
The flower, the bricks, and the sea
My intuition says you will like me
And I don't know where should I be?

[Chorus: Ardhito Pramono & Aurelie Moeremans]
And maybe you want to be a star?
It may seem you want to be in love
I don't care it taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight

[Verse 3: Ardhito Pramono & Aurelie Moeremans]
Falling in love is a new world for me
Do you want to be my company?
From thousand of miles you will like it in here
No need, no anniversary

[Chorus: Ardhito Pramono & Aurelie Moeremans]
And maybe you want to be a star?
It may seem you want to be in love
I don't care it taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight

[Chorus: Ardhito Pramono & Aurelie Moeremans]
And maybe you want to be a star?
It may seem you want to be in love
I don't care it taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight
And maybe you want to be a star?
It may seem you want to be in love
I don't care it taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight
I just couldn't save you tonight
I just couldn't save you tonight1Embed
