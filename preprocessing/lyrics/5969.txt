Here she comes
You better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two, it's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She'll build you up to just put you down, what a clown

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

[Verse 2]
You're written in her book
You're number thirty-seven, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy, she's from the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool, yes it's true

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
Oh, woah, woah (She's a femme fatale)
Oh, woah, woah (She's a femme fatale)
Oh, woah, woah (She's a femme fatale)9Embed
