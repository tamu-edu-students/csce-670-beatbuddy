25 Contributors5 Minutes Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see you had your mind all made up
You group of pitiful liars
Before I woke to face the day
Your master plan transpired
Something told me
This job has more to meet the eye
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?
Now I'm unwhole

[Chorus]
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave that scar
You cry for compensation
I ask you please just give us
Five minutes alone
Just give us
Five minutes alone

[Verse 2]
I read your eyes, your mind was made up
You took me for a fool
You used complexion of my skin
For a counter racist tool
You can't burn me
I've spilled my guts out in the past
Taken advantage of
Because you know where I come from
My past
You might also like[Chorus]
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave the scar
I'll bury your compensation
I ask you please just give us
Five minutes alone
Just give us
Five minutes alone

[Post-Chorus]
Headbutt to broken glass
Five minutes alone
Just give me

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
And stop

[Refrain]
I ask you please just give us
Five minutes alone

[Outro]
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please, please
I ask you please (Five minutes alone)
I ask you please
(Five minutes alone)
I'm asked to bleed
I try to breathe
And I try to free
I paid my deeds
(Five minutes alone)
I paid with my soul
I take back control
I take back control
I paid with my soul... [?]9Embed
