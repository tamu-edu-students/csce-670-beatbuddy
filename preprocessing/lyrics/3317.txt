Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky
Yours until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die

[Verse 2: Oisin Leech]
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines
Yours until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time

[Bridge: Alex Turner]
I'm gonna stay right here by your side
And do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothing in the world could drive me away
Every day, you'll hear me say

[Verse 3: Alex Turner]
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until two and two is three
Yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea
In other words, until eternity

[Outro: Alex Turner & Oisin Leech]
Baby, I'm yours, 'til the stars fall from the sky
Baby, I'm yours, until the rivers all run dry
Baby, I'm yours, until the sun no longer shines
Baby, I'm yours, until the poets run out of rhyme
Baby, I'm yoursYou might also like15Embed
