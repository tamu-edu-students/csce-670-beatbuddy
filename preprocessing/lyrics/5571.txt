6 ContributorsThe Latter Teens Lyrics[Verse 1]
Out of the highways
That span to the seas
The one that I'd take
Never stops inbetween
A whole 3000 mile road
With one brief pause in Yellowstone
If the day comes
In which you decide
You wanna waste some
And go for a drive
Well I'll be ready when you call
For Highway 20 in the fall

[Chorus]
We'd be quintessential leads
Who found love in the latter teens
I guess we'll wait and see

[Verse 2]
Specific shores wet
The terminus lies
Pacific Northwest
The end of the ride
With rolls of photos to compile
We won't see oceans for a while

The lights all went down
Across the US
In its cities and towns
The main spots I consider home
The Rust Belt and the driftless zone

[Chorus]
The way you thought your life might be
It fell apart in the latter teens
It always gets to me1Embed
