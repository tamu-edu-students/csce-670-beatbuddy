69 ContributorsCool Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can run free, I won't hold it against ya
You do your thing, never wanted a future
Fuck if I knew how to put it romantic
Speaking my truth, there's no need to panic

[Pre-Chorus]
No, let's not put a label on it
Let's keep it fun
We don't put a label on it
So we can run free, yeah
I wanna be free like you

[Chorus]
I'm a, I'm a
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy

[Verse 2]
Rules you don't like, but you still wanna keep 'em (Ah)
Said you were fine so for whatever reason
Sure we can chill, try and keep it platonic (Oh, yeah)
Now you can't tell if I'm really ironic
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
No, let's not put a label on it
Let's keep it fun
We don't put a label on it
So we can run free, yeah
I wanna be free like you

[Chorus]
I'm a, I'm a
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy (Uh)
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy

[Bridge]
I got fever highs
I got boiling blood
I'm that fire kind (Yeah)
We could burn together

[Chorus]
I'm a
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy (Boy)
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy
[Outro]
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl (Too cool for you)
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm a, I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy43Embed
