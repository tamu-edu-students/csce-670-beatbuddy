4 ContributorsJust to break my heart Lyrics[Intro]
Did you leave me here just to break my heart?
And did you fear our love, was it all just talk

[Verse]
It floated away, without a goodbye
I think our hope went out this time
Relying on dreams to show me your face

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll say
Come back, come back, come back someday

[Chorus]
Did you leave me here just to break my heart?
And did you fear our love would just fall apart?
Oh... no...
I thought you’d stay to save me
And did you leave me here just to break my heart?

[Bidge]
I thought you'd stay
I thought you'd stay around (For me)
I thought you’d stay
I thought you'd stay around (For me)
(For mе)

And did you leave me here just to break my heart? (Baby I'm dying to know)
And did you fear our love would just fall apart?
(Oh... no...)Embed
