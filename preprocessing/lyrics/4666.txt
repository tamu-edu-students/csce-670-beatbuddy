Prod MOL$

[Chorus]
Living the Golden Experience, uh
My life too lit, it’s delirious
I keep that star on my back, uh (Yeah)
Look at my face, can’t fear shit, uh
Built to the top like a pyramid, uh (Mm)
My lineage lit and it’s serious (Hm)
Bring the beat life like Giorno (Woosh!)
Young gangstar, flip the kill switch (Agh)

[Post-Chorus]
JoJo pose, pose, pose
JoJo pose, pose, pose
JoJo pose, pose, pose
JoJo pose, pose, pose

[Bridge]
Are you sure you’re not an enemy stand user?

[Verse]
Arrow to my knee, nah, can’t stand niggas
Gangstar gang moves, bands get bigger
Rock, paper, scissors, my hands too different
Move like Bruno, might dip in a zipper
Shooting shots, Purple Hermit, put you in the picture
Shooting shots, gun loaded, feel like Mista
I be with my dawg, like Iggy
Avdol mindset, fire flame with me
Still came with the water, bitch, I feel like Misty
Waifu with me, she miss me, she kiss me
Got her breathing like Hamon
Murder, murder, muda, muda, beat it up, come on
Lisa Lisa love me lots with the glove on
Slay a stand and let the Requiem run on (Ooh!)
You might also like[Chorus]
Living the Golden Experience, uh
My life too lit, it’s delirious
I keep that star on my back, uh (Yeah)
Look at my face, can’t fear shit, uh
Built to the top like a pyramid, uh (Mm)
My lineage lit and it’s serious (Hm)
Bring the beat life like Giorno
Young gangstar, flip the kill switch

[Post-Chorus]
JoJo pose, pose, pose
JoJo pose, pose, pose
JoJo pose, pose, pose
JoJo pose, pose, pose

[Outro: Apollo Fresh & Takehito Koyasu]
I love you, Apollo Fresh, daisuke
Got that Emerald Green, feel like Kakyoin
Wavlengths, enjoy the moment
Got that Emerald Green, feel like Kakyoin, ay
