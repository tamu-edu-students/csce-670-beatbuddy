When I heard that sound
When the walls came down
I was thinking about you
About you
When my skin grows old
When my breath runs cold
I'll be thinking about you
About you

[Verse 1]
Seconds from my heart
A bullet from the dark
Helpless, I surrender
Shackled by your love
Holding me like this
With poison on your lips
Only when it's over
The silence hits so hard

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it was almost love, it was almost love
It was almost love, it was almost love

[Chorus]
When I heard that sound
When the walls came down
I was thinking about you
About you
When my skin grows old
When my breath runs cold
I'll be thinking about you
About you

When I run out of air to breathe
It's your ghost I see
I'll be thinking about you, about you
It was almost love, it was almost–

[Verse 2]
We bleed ourselves in vain
How tragic is this game?
Turn around, I'm holding on to someone
But the love is gone
Carrying the load, with wings that feel like stone
Knowing that we nearly fell so far now
It's hard to tell

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah we came so close, it was almost love
It was almost love, it was almost love

[Chorus]
When I heard that sound
When the walls came down
I was thinking about you
About you
When my skin grows old
When my breath runs cold
I'll be thinking about you
About you
[Post-Chorus]
When I run out of air to breathe
It's your ghost I see
I'll be thinking about you, about you

[Bridge]
I reached out for your hand
When the walls were caving in
But I see you on the other side
We can try all over again

[Chorus]
When I heard that sound
When the walls came down
I was thinking about you
About you
When my skin grows old
When my breath runs cold
I'll be thinking about you
About you

[Post-Chorus]
When I run out of air to breathe
It's your ghost I see
I'll be thinking about you, about you
[Outro]
'Cause it was almost love, it was almost love
It was almost love, it was almost love19Embed
