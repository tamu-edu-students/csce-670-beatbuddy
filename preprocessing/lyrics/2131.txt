41 ContributorsStricken Lyrics[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, aw

[Verse 1]
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention

[Chorus]
The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope
And we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

[Interlude]
Ah, ah, ah, aw

[Verse 2]
You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless

Into the abyss will I run

[Bridge]
Ah
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
Don't want to mention

[Chorus]
The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope
And we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
[Post-Chorus]
Into the abyss will I run
I can't let you go
Yes, I am stricken and can't let you go15Embed
