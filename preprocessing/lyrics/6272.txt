Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone, my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

[Verse 2]
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought, I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

[Pre-Chorus]
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded, but determined to try

[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds, I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

[Chorus]
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I33Embed
