77 ContributorsGives You Hell Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wake up every evenin'
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels outta place
And you're still probably workin'
At a 9 to 5 pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

[Chorus]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

[Verse 2]
Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Yeah, do you know where you are?

[Pre-Chorus]
And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lyin'

[Chorus]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

Tomorrow, you'll be thinkin' to yourself
"Yeah, where did it all go wrong?"
But the list goes on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lyin'

[Chorus]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell

[Bridge]
Now, you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well
[Breakdown]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
[Chorus]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell!)
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you hear this song and you sing along, no, you never tell (No, you never tell)
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

[Outro]
When you hear this song, I hope that it will give you hell
(Hope it gives you hell)
You can sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell49Embed
