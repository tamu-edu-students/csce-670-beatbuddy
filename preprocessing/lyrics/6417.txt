Show me a sign, show me a reason to give
A solitary fuck about your goddamn beliefs
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation you'll feel
Brick by brick, by brick
Brick by brick, by brick

[Verse 2]
What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse
Cloak and daggers murder the truth
The bitter taste, there's nothing else
I'll bow for your king when he shows himself

[Chorus]
Brick by brick, by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues

[Verse 3]
Show me your face, show me a reason to think
My soul can be saved if I sell you my sins
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation for me
You might also like[Chorus]
Brick by brick, by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues

[Post-Chorus]
The house of wolves you built
The house of wolves you built
The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns

[Breakdown]
Yeah
And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is two foot wide and six foot deep
Yeah
And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is two foot wide and six foot deep
Oh, when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is two foot wide and six foot deep
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Brick by brick, by brick
Brick by brick, by brick
[Chorus]
Brick by brick, by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues
Brick by brick, by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns

[Outro]
You said you want me
Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here
You said you want me
Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here25Embed
