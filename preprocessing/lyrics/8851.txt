You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer
If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven

[Chorus]
Cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move
You take my air
You show me how deep love can be

[Verse 2]
You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer

[Chorus]
Cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
Cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away

You show me how deep love can be
You show me how deep love can be
This is my prayer

[Chorus]
Cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away
Won't shy
Cherish the day
I won't go astray

[Outro]
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day12Embed
