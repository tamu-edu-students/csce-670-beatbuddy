I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
And I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight
And I want a Sunday kind of love, oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I want a, a, a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody, someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

[Bridge]
I do my Sunday dreaming, oh yeah, and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
Oh, I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

[Verse 3]
And my arms need someone, someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
Love for all my life, to have and to hold
Oh, and I want a Sunday kind of love, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I don't want a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday
Friday or Saturday, oh, nothing but Sunday, oh yeah, yeah
I want a Sunday, Sunday, I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yeah, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday kind of loveYou might also like2Embed
