38 ContributorsScars Lyrics[Intro]
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 1]
I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just want to be alone
I'm pissed 'cause you came around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause I've channeled all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is:

[Chorus]
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
Tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 2]
I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you goin' down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
And I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand
You might also like[Chorus]
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 3]
I’m drunk and I’m feeling down
And I just want to be alone
You should've never come around
Why don’t you just go home?
'Cause you’re drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn’t understand
(But you didn’t understand)
Go fix yourself!

[Bridge]
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life
[Chorus]
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel26Embed
