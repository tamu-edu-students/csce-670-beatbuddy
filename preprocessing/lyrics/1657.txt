7 ContributorsYoung Right Now Lyrics[Intro: Dennis Lloyd]
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
Are we young right now, are we young right now?

[Verse 1: Dennis Lloyd]
Take my wishes away
I no longer need them
I no longer need them
Bury my hopes and dreams
I no longer need them
I no longer need them

[Pre-Chorus: Dennis Lloyd]
I don't know how to free my mind
When there's no way out
Long ago, we could leave our lives
Now we're wondering how

[Chorus: Dennis Lloyd]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say

Maybe one day we'll fly
And take back freedom
And take back freedom
We shouldn't be scare to fight
If we don't believe them
No longer believe them

[Pre-Chorus: Dennis Lloyd]
Now I know how to free my mind
When there's no way out
Way too long we've been asking how
Are we young right now?

[Chorus: Dennis Lloyd]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now?
We say

[Chorus: Dennis Lloyd]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now?
We say, ohEmbed
