9 ContributorsMade for You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Water towers are made for hearts and names
Friday nights are made for football games
Fallin' leaves are made for fallin' in
Front porch steps are made for goodnight kissin'
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

[Verse 2]
Summer jobs are made for spendin' cash
Second dates are made for goin' fast
Early curfews are made for sneakin' past
2 a.m. was made for pissed off dads
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

[Chorus]
Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

[Verse 3]
Smoky bars are made for "How 'bout a dance?"
Open roads are made for holdin' hands and
Laid back seats are made for young love
Two pink lines are made for growin' up
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

[Verse 4]
Tiny shoes are made for tiny feet
My two arms are made for where you sleep
Sky was made for the moon and stars
You were made to steal my heart
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you2Embed
