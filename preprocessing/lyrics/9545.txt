2 ContributorsDo Too Much Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
We do not trip 'bout these niggas that run behind hoes, we giving 'em straight to the streets
We don't surrender to bitches that's having a issue, we running up straight to the beef
We don't put pressure on nothing that ain't 'bout no money 'cause anything less gon' be cheap
We just be sitting back laughing while bitches be acting and running it straight through their teeth

[Chorus]
'Cause we do not do too much, we just gon' do enough, get us a bag
We been on top, we ain't coming in last, made it quadruple, I know that they mad
Look, we do not do too much, we just gon' do enough, gеt us some dough
If it run out we gon' get us somе more, got off my ass, had to get me a load

[Verse 1]
Sis, don't get mad 'cause your nigga keep looking at me 'cause he know that I'm fine as the fuck
They think I'm chilling and losing my focus but I just been quietly running it up
Bitches be acting so gangsta, but when I get active, lil' mama, I'm calling your bluff
Know I be dreaming 'bout having a fairytale life, but, baby, I need me a thug
And he just gon' ride for me and he be doing whatever I say
Whenever I call him he never be late, ooh, he so gangsta, he sleep with the K
Look he just might die for me (He might die for me), shawty been loyal, I bought him a treat
He tried to get over, I thought it was sweet, I'm telling you now, don't argue with me
But we got that stick talk (That stick talk), it look like a dildo (Look like a dildo)
He keep on cheating, she keep on staring, ooh, that bitch real slow (Retarted), look
We was kicking shit all in the 3, taking off like a field goal
Every day grinding, we focused on paper, no cap, we in chill mode ('Cause listen)

[Verse 2]
They can pop shit and go say what they want, but I promise these little bitches know not to play with me
Fighting for what? When I got a Glock that stay loaded, they know that lil' motherfucker stay with me
Stay on my shit, never been pressed for no dick, I'm the one bitches couldn't pay to be (Facts)
Get out your feelings lil' mama, no matter what's said, I promise you he gon' keep chasing me
I wanna ghost, I want an island that's right off the coast
I want these bitches to stay in their place, look, I want the nigga that don't do the most
Girl, don't be acting like you do not care he be cheating, be real, just say that you slow (Facts)
Bitch, do not stare in my face and you know that it's pressure, be chill, you don't want this smoke
Ho, we got mob ties (Murder) and they run real deep (My family)
I be the hardest one straight out the A, ooh, these folk real sleep (I promise)
They keep on asking me who is my dentist, look, these are my real teeth (They're mine)
I cannot watch all these bitches be dummies, I swear that shit kill me ('Cause listen)
