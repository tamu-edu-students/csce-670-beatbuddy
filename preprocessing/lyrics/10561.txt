4 ContributorsHoney Bucket LyricsEight times a felon for fire
Like cobalt cast and clean
I got a motor felt the wheel
Real fast and fear

Try, jack it, black it for more
Handcuffs with special keys
Triple lies and been down defiled
It's a vsi

Throw a case of plasticine down
Baby I can immolate
And it's rotten in my rounds
Sister's in my way

I'm as fast as my home town
Green glass and most of all
Been around this foreign cage
An image in the wallYou might also likeEmbed
