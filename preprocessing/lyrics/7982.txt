They be sayin' this and that, all that shit is cap
Pull up on 'em real life, like where the energy at?
I shot you, I robbed you and y'all didn't do nothin' back
Remember that? Niggas lack
Y'all ain't do nothin' back, but make tracks
Suck dick, nigga, eat my sack
I shot at all y'all rappers, real life, no cap
The feds charged me for that, whole fuckin' case
So eat a dick, lil' nigga, don't watch my face
Ain't no bitty bad, run up on a nigga, give me that
Where your jewelry at? Stupid lil' nigga, give me that
Where your blicky at? Pull up on him, make it brrah
Bitch, you know that when I see you we gon' make it brrah
I got this flicky, flicky, flicky shot, make him Milly Rock
Silly Blicky, called it glizzy shop, made 'em Diddy Bop
Still be posted by the chicken spot, 'cause my city hot
Silencer, that shit go, "Shh," but this .40 blick a shot

[Chorus]
I got this Mickey, Mickey, moppy-moppy-mop-mop
Look, you could catch a shot-sh-shot-sh-shot-shot
Watch him twirl, then he drop-d-drop-d-drop-drop
I got the game on lock-l-lock-l-lock-lock

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rosie, still keep it on me
Fuck a lil' semi, nigga, I'm comin' with this choppa
Bullet that just hit him, he won't make it to the doctor
Stand over his body, kick his head like it's soccer
Your man got shot and you made a diss track
Go get a gun and get some get-back
Your man got shot, he not comin' back
Go get a gun and get some get-back
You a bitch, I knew you wouldn't ride for your homie
I knew you wouldn't ride by your doley
They be on my dick, but if you know me, then you know me
Couple chains, good drip and the Rollie too swollie, look
Big watch, big Cuban, talk weird
Send addy, my guys come in
No smiles, no games, fun where?
Die today, can't get away, fun where?

I got this Mickey, Mickey, moppy-moppy-mop-mop
Look, you could catch a shot-sh-shot-sh-shot-shot
Watch him twirl, then he drop-d-drop-d-drop-drop
I got the game on lock-l-lock-l-lock-lock6Embed
