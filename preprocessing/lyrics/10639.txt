Is it really me you're missing?
Or am I the only one who'll listen? Mmm
All of these high hopes and low blows
I hope you know
Just how much it hurts to believe you
I should cut this off, but I need you
I should help myself, but I can't help myself

[Chorus]
Is it really me you're missing?
Or am I the only one who'll listen to you?
And if I pick up the phone tonight
Will it be pieces by the morning?
Am I the only number that you've tried?
Or is it just another lonely night?

[Verse 2]
Everybody tells me what I should've done now
'Cause I only ever tell them when you're letting me down
Oh, high hopes and low blows
I hope you know
Just how much I've wanted to leave you
But there's nobody else that can be you
I should help myself
You might also like[Chorus]
Is it really me you're missing?
Or am I the only one who'll listen to you?
And if I pick up the phone tonight
Will it be pieces by the morning?
Am I the only number that you've tried?
Or is it just another lonely night?

[Bridge]
Is it really me?
And if you turn all the lights off
And put your hands on my body
Could I be just anybody? (Is it really me?)
And when you get what you wanted
Is that the end of the story?
I know you'll never be sorry
Until it's really me you're missing

[Chorus]
Is it really me you're missing?
Or am I the only one who'll listen to you?
And if I pick up the phone tonight
Will it be pieces by the morning?
Am I the only number that you've tried?
Or is it just another lonely night?
[Outro]
Is it really me you're missing?
Is it really me?
Is it really me?2Embed
