Come on, baby, and drop it
Scrub the floor and just mop it
Show these gangsters how you pop lock it
Don't care what you got in your pocket
I get the way that you rocking
Flip that thang thang don't stop it
When I just bang bang and pop it
While the club crowded just watch you (Work it out)

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
Got a gang of cash and it's going all on the bar (Now work it out)
And it's going fast cause I feel like a superstar (Now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (Now work it out)
It's your time to grab it, now make this whole thing yours
(Now work it out)

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Hey, said a hustler's work is never through
We making it 'cause we making moves
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partying like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partying like it's your job, eh

Yes, I'm fresh-to-death lookin' plush
Ladies can't get enough
Got my fitness, I'm looking buff
And all my people with me, I trust
Holding down for my city
If they asking you, I'm not guilty
Only thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me
(Work it out)
