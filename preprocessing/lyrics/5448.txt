I bet you thought your life would change
But you're sat on a train again
Your memories are sceneries for things you said
But never really meant
You build it to a high to say goodbye
Because you're not the same as them
But your death it won't happen to you
It happens to your family and your friends
I pretend

[Chorus]
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes

[Verse 2]
You win, you lose, you sing the blues
There's no point in buying concrete shoes
I'll refuse

[Chorus]
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die

[Bridge]
Am I me through geography?
A face collapsed through entropy
I can hardly speak
And when I try it's nothing but a squeak
On the video
Living room for small
If you can't survive, just try
You might also like[Chorus]
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
And I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
I, sometimes, always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes66Embed
