Angels on the sideline
Puzzled and amused
Why did Father give these humans free will?

Angels on the sideline again
Benched along with patience and reason
Angels on the sideline again
Wondering where this tug of war will end
[Outro]
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Right in two
