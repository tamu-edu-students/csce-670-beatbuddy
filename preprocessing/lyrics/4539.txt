13 ContributorsNever Forget You Lyrics[Verse 1]
What you drinkin'?
Rum or whiskey?
Now won't you have a
Double with me?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry I'm a little late
I got your message by the way
I'm calling in sick today
So let's go 'round for old times' sake

[Chorus]
I'll never forget you
They said we'd never make it
My sweet joy
Always remember me

[Verse 2]
We were mischievous
And you were always wearing black
I was so serious
You know my boyfriend's mother nearly had a heart attack

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry I'm a little late
You know the stripes on a tiger are hard to change
And though this world feels like an empty stage
I wouldn't change a thing, so glad you're back again
You might also like[Chorus]
I'll never forget you
They said we'd never make it
My sweet joy
Always remember me
I'll never forget you (No matter near or far)
At times, we couldn't shake it
You're my joy
Always remember me

[Bridge]
We just got swallowed up
You know I didn't forget you
We just got swallowed up
Yeah, we just got swallowed up
But you know that I didn't forget you
We just got swallowed up by the whole damn world

[Verse 3]
What you thinkin'?
Did you miss me?
I borrowed your silver boots
Now if you'd just let me give them back to you

[Chorus]
I'll never forget you
They said we'd never make it
My sweet joy
Always remember me
I'll never forget you (No matter near or far)
Oh, darling, at times, we couldn't shake it
You're my joy
Always remember me
Don't you know that you're my joy?
Always remember me
Don't you know that you're my joy?
Always remember me1Embed
