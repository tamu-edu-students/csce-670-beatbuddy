39 ContributorsDuvet Lyrics[Verse 1]
And you don't seem to understand
A shame you seemed an honest man
And all the fears you hold so dear
Will turn to whisper in your ear
And you know what they say might hurt you
And you know that it means so much
And you don't even feel a thing

[Chorus]
I am falling
I am fading
I have lost it all

[Verse 2]
And you don't seem the lying kind
A shame that I can read your mind
And all the things that I read there
Candlelit smile that we both share
And you know I don't mean to hurt you
But you know that it means so much
And you don't even feel a thing

[Chorus]
I am falling
I am fading
I am drowning
Help me to breathe
I am hurting
I have lost it all
I am losing
Help me to breathe

I am failing

Help me to breathe
I am hurting
I have lost it all
I am losing
Help me to breathe

[Bridge]
Ho-oh, yeah
Ho-oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I am falling
I am failing
I am drowning
Help me to breathe
I am hurting
I have lost it all
I am losing
Help me to breathe41Embed
