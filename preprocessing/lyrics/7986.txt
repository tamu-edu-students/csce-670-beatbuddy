Me on the roof
Yeah, I'm up for everything you say (Aye)
I'm into you
We just can't deny this chemistry

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're with me
Be honest
Let's just be honest
You got me in my feelings
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Never understood what it feels like
Like the way that you're turning me 'round
If you ever feel down and out
Let me know, let me know, yeah, yeah
Don't be sleepin' on you, there's nothing better
Don't be sleepin' on your lovе, nothing's better
Yeah, yеah

[Verse 2]
This one's for you
Let me paint it how I want it, babe (Aye)
Yeah, that's what love is
You can take it all out on me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When you're with me
Be honest
Let's just be honest
You got me in my feelings (Aye)

If you ever feel down and out
Let me know, let me know, yeah, yeah
Don't be sleepin' on you, there's nothing better
Don't be sleepin' on your love, nothing's better
