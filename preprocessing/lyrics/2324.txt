I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave and take my hand
Drowning inside these walls of fear
Take my hand and stay with me my dear

[Verse]
I think you broke my heart again
Please don’t leave and take my hand
Drowning inside these walls of fear
Take my hand and stay with me my dear
I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave and take my hand
Drowning inside these walls of fear
Take my hand and stay with me my dear

[Outro]
I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave and take my hand
Drowning inside these walls of fear
(You knew before I did)
(Why’re you crying?)
Take my hand and stay...
