[Verse 1]
I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now, I need someone to breathe me back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches

[Verse 2]
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now, I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seein' red on my own
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches

[Bridge]
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Get you outta my head
[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees (Falling onto my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches (I'll be needin' stitches)
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help (Begging, baby, please)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches

[Outro]
Now that I'm without your kisses
Yeah, I'll be needin' stitches
Now that I'm without your kisses
Yeah, I'll be needin' stitches195Embed
