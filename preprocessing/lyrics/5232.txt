6 ContributorsStereo Love (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Bridge: Vika Jigulina]
When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go, don't let go to my love

[Verse 1: Vika Jigulina with Edward Maya]
Can I get to your soul? Can you get to my flow?
Can we promise we won't let go?
All the things that I need, all the things that you need
You can make it feel so real
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you baby, I just don't wanna let go

[Bridge: Vika Jigulina]
When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go, don't let go to my love

[Pre-Chorus: Edward Maya]
I came to see you, but I just might go overboard tonight
I came to see you, but I might go inside
I think I found the one that'll hold my heart
I wanna feel your heart, we're in love tonight

I can fix all those lies
Oh baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby, I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I1Embed
