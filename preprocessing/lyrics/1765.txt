What if I told you I loved you?
What if I told you I lied?
Remember all of our hellos
As I tell you goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
If you see me in a daze
I feel better out of place
It's true, ooh
I don't need to be saved
I'm a fucking renegade, uh

[Chorus]
Highs, lows, I got no in-between
Baby, I know I've been talking in my sleep
Free-faller, I drown in the deep
Baby, I know I go to extremes

[Post-Chorus]
Extremes, extremes
Extremes, extremes
Extremes, extremes
'Cause, baby, I know I go to еxtremes

I'm terrified of peace and quiet
I'm always running on the wire
I fall in love in the middle of the riot

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
If you see me in a daze
I feel better out of place
It's true, ooh
I don't need to be saved
I'm a fucking renegade, uh

[Chorus]
Highs, lows, I got no in-between
Baby, I know I've been talking in my sleep
Free-faller, I drown in the deep
Baby, I know, I go to extremes

[Post-Chorus]
Extremes, extremes
Extremes, extremes
Extremes, extremes
'Cause, baby, I know I go to extremes
[Outro]
