If you see the boy I used to be
Could you tell him that I'd like to find him?
And if you see the shell that's left of me
Could you spare him a little kindness?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been high and I've been low
I've spent a thousand nights alone, tryna hold on tight
Feelings come but they won't go
Please, won't someone take me home before I lose my mind?

[Chorus]
Am I broken? Am I flawed?
Do I deserve a shred of worth or am I just another fake, fucked up lost cause?
And am I human? Or am I something else?
'Cause I'm so scared and there's no one there
To save me from the nightmare that I call myself

[Verse 2]
I've tried everything and anything
But nothing seems to work quite like it should
Between the madness and the apathy
Seems there's nothing left inside of me that's good

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been high and I've been low
I've spent a thousand nights alone, tryna hold on tight
And feelings come but they won't go
Please, won't someone take me home before I lose my mind?
