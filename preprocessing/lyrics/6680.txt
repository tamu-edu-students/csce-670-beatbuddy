When I come home
When I calm down
I have you
You have me, honey
When I come home
When I calm down

When I calm down

You have me, honey
When I come home
When I calm down
I have you
You have me, honey
When I come home
When I come home
When I come home
You have me, honey
When I come home
When I calm down
I have you
You have me, honey
When I come home
When I calm down
I have you
You have me, honey
