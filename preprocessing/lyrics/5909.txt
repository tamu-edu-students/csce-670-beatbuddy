On the inside cries for help
But on the out her eyes are dry
So I said my oh my
She's no ordinary mind
The world is one big horror story
But you got me by your side
Oh I said

Sea green is the color of her eyes
And no one knows when she's upset
I find no use in asking why
She won't reveal what's in her head
I count the days since I seen you smile
It's hard to fake but she tries her best
Feeling broken and beaten down
You can see it in yourself

You can see the signs like woah
She used to shine, now frozen cold
Used to stand like a daffodil
Now she fold like an open rose
You can see the signs like woah
She used to shine, now frozen cold
Used to stand like a daffodil
Now she fold like an open rose
You might also likeI just hope this melancholy ends
And you come back to me like

She shines but for her it's dark and grime
On the inside cries for help
But on the out her eyes are dry
So I said my oh my
She's no ordinary mind
The world is one big horror story
But you got me by your side
Oh I saidEmbed
