2 ContributorsRave Love Lyrics[Verse]
It's not a dream, it is reality
You are my shining star
I wanna move, I wanna shout out
That's what you do to me
I feel alive, can't get enough
You're the drug I'm addicted to
You make me dance, I feel the freedom
You are the rave to me

[Chorus]
Baby, come and save me
I am waiting for you to come and find me
Baby, come and save me
I am waiting, don't wanna rave without you
Baby, come and save me
I am waiting for you to come and find me
Baby, come and save me
I am waiting, don't wanna rave without you

[Bridge]
I'm far away from home, but the thought of you keeps me alive
I've always known that you'rе the one I need to find
I will nevеr let you go
I'm never alone 'cause the rave is always by my side
I'm far away from home, but the thought of you keeps me alive
I've always known that you're the one I need to find
I will never let you go
I'm never alone 'cause the rave is always by my side

Far away from home, but the thought of you keeps me aliveEmbed
