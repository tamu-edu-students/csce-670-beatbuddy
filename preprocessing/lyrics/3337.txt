22 ContributorsBlow My Brains Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wish I could lend you my eyes
Lend you my hips and lend you my thighs
Sometimes I wish I could take a new shape
Switch out some parts and become a big A
Sometimes I wish I could lend you my ears
Lend you my thoughts and lend you my tears
Sometimes I wish I could take a new form
Switch out some parts and become like the norm

[Chorus]
Lucky is she who lives unaware
Doesn't get bothered by those who don't care
Lucky is she who lives unaware
Who doesn't get bothered by all that's unfair

Unlucky me who knows way too much
Who fights to make changes and music and such
Unlucky me, aware of the pain
All 'cause I happen to have some brain

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wish I could lend you my voice
Lend you my heart and lend you my choice
Sometimes I hope for a savior to come
Who's got what it takes to convince everyone
You might also likeSometimes I wish I could lend you my shoes
Lend you my life and lend you my truth
But sometimes the truth is just my point of view
Not what is real and not what is true

[Chorus]
Lucky is she who lives unaware
Who doesn't get bothered by those who don't care
Lucky is she who lives unaware
Who doesn't get bothered by all that's unfair

Unlucky me who knows way too much
Who fights to make changes and music and such
Unlucky me, aware of the pain
All 'cause I happen to have some brain

[Bridge]
Lucky is she who lives unaware
Lucky is she who lives unaware

[Chorus]
Unlucky me who knows way too much
Who fights to make changes and music and such
Unlucky me, aware of the pain
All 'cause I happen to have some brain10Embed
