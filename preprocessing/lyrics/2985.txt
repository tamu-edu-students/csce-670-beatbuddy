22 ContributorsMarry Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preachin' the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money

[Pre-Chorus ]
Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now

[Chorus]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without cryin' so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Verse 2]
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends for forever
And I'd always wondered if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know her daddy's been dreadin' this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one givin' her away

I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without cryin' so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, oh, woah

[Bridge]
Bet she got on her dress now, welcomin' the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I wish her the best now

[Chorus]
So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hidin' out in the back
Doin' a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without cryin' so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
Yeah, she gonna get married
But she ain't gonna marry me

[Outro]
Woah, she ain't gonna marry me, no9Embed
