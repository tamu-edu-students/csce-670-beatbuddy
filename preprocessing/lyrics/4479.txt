1 ContributorBy Your Side Lyrics[Verse 1]
We've all been there before
Searching for open doors
Living on fading hope
We all got battle scars
Demons and broken carts
Trying our best to cope

[Pre-Chorus]
So you should never worry
You can trust me
You're not on your own

[Chorus]
If you leave it all behind this moment
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
If you feel like all your lights are stolen
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
So when you're down, when you're up, I'll be there
And when you're lost in the dark, don't be scared
If you leave it all behind this moment
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side

Sometimes it's hard to swim
Start all over again
When you keep going under
We all got battle scars
Demons and broken parts
But we don't lose our colors

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we all need someone
To rely on
When we feel alone

[Chorus]
If you leave it all behind this moment
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
If you feel like all your lights are stolen
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
So when you're down, when you're up, I'll be there
And when you're lost in the dark, don't be scared
If you leave it all behind this moment
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side, I'll be by your sideEmbed
