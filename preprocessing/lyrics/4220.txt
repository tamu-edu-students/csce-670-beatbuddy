6 ContributorsOff The Ground Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Fire, you got me through the cold
A path that's paved in gold
And when darkness weighs me down

[Chorus]
You lift me off the ground
The ground, the ground, the ground
The ground, the ground
You lift me off the ground
The ground, the ground, the ground
The ground, the ground
Yeah you lift me off the ground

[Drop]
Yeah you lift me off the ground
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah you lift me off thе ground
You lift me off the ground

[Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
Fire, you got mе through the cold
A path that's paved in gold
And when darkness weighs me down
You might also like[Chorus]
You lift me off the ground
The ground, the ground, the ground
The ground, the ground
Yeah you lift me off the ground

[Buildup]
The ground, the ground, the ground
The ground, the ground

[Drop]
You lift me off the ground

[Outro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You lift me off the ground
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
