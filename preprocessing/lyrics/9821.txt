2 Contributors​​summer nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
I saw you walking down the street one day
It was a Sunday
You had flowers in your hair
And you were dancing with your headphones on
Didn't care that everyone was watching
You were moving to the beat
Cars were swerving in the street
Just to get a glimpse of you
And you were posing for them
Yeah, you were struttin' for them
'Cause you know just what you do

[Chorus]
So if I never told you, baby
You should know I'm going crazy
I can't help myself anymore
'Cause I've been looking for the one
And now I think I found you, love
'Cause things have never been this good before
'Cause you're dancing in the corner
You're dancing how you wanna
And I can't help but smile
And then I start to tap my feet
And babe, we're moving to the beat
Summer nights with you and I
You might also like[Verse 2]
I never thought I would've felt that love
I was dreaming of
But my head is over heels and now you got me
And I just can't breathe with you here, babe
You should know
You can tell me how you feel
Pour your heart out if it's real
We can dance 'til three in the morning
And I don't wanna pretend like I just wanna be friends
So if I'm being honest, oh

[Chorus]
So if I never told you, baby
You should know I'm going crazy
I can't help myself anymore
'Cause I've been looking for the one
And now I think I found you, love
'Cause things have never been this good before
'Cause you're dancing in the corner
You're dancing how you wanna
And I can't help but smile
And then I start to tap my feet
And babe, we're moving to the beat
Summer nights with you and I
[Bridge]
But honestly, it's such a shame
When my friends are getting in the way
But I just don't know what to say
'Cause it's hard for me to walk away
Yeah, honestly, it's such a shame
When my friends are getting in the way
But I just don't know what to say
'Cause it's hard for me to walk away

[Chorus]
So if I never told you, baby
You should know I'm going crazy
I can't help myself anymore
'Cause I've been looking for the one
And now I think I found you, love
'Cause things have never been this good before
'Cause you're dancing in the corner
You're dancing how you wanna
And I can't help but smile
And then I start to tap my feet
And babe, we're moving to the beat
Summer nights with you and I2Embed
