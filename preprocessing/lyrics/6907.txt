You're that Goddess
Aphrodite
Well known for her Love and beauty
You took me and you bathe me in
Your waters, your fountain
Left me yearning for more, for more
And I can’t take it anymore

[Chorus]
If I can have this dance tonight
I promise that you won't forget
I've been searching all my life
For something that I won’t regret
Could it be that you're the one I'm looking for
Ahhhh

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you one thing for sure
You're the only one I want more of
Cos every time, you strip away my pride
Humble me down to my knees
You're exactly what I need, you're exactly

[Chorus]
If I can have this dance tonight
I promise that you won't forget
I've been searching all my life
For something that I won’t regret
Could it be that you’re the one I'm looking for
Ahhhh
You might also like[Bridge]
Won’t you take me away
Bring me to your sacred place
Won't you ooooohhhh

[Chorus]
If I can have this dance tonight
I promise that you won't forget
I've been searching all my life
For something that I won’t regret
Could it be that you're the one I'm looking for
Ahhhh4Embed
