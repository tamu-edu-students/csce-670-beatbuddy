I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
But she said, "Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?"
I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
She said, "Whered 'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?"
I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can miss

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this126Embed
