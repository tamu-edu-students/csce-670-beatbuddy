15 ContributorsWords Lyrics[Intro]
I got the words "I love you"
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue

[Verse 1]
At your house again
Are we more than friends?
There's so much that I wanna say
But I gotta hold it back
So scared how you'll react
I just hide it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I could give you it all in a minute
We'll fall any minute
But we go 'round and 'round
I don't wanna mention commitment
But I feel it slippin'
So please don't let me down, me down

[Chorus]
I got the words "I love you"
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue
Oh, I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth
You're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away
You might also like[Verse 2]
You know we connect
More than just the sex
But arе you gonna let me in?
I can set your world on firе
But you're holdin' the lighter
Instead, you're puttin' out our flame

[Pre-Chorus]
I could give you it all in a minute
We'll fall any minute
But we go 'round and 'round
I don't wanna mention commitment
But I feel it slippin'
So please don't let me down

[Chorus]
I got the words "I love you"
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue
Oh, I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth
You're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away (Run)
Run away (Run)
Run away (Run)
I got the words "I love you"
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue
Oh, I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth
You're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away
[Outro]
If I say it now
Then one day, I'll wake up
And you walked out (You walked out)
So I just stay here with the words "I love you"
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue (Sittin' on the tip of my tongue)6Embed
