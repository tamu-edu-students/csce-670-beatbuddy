9 ContributorsDidn’t Know Lyrics[Chorus]
Didn't know I had you in my heart
You didn't know I had you in my heart
Didn't know I had you in my heart
Tell me that we'll never be apart

[Verse 1]
Me and a ten had been talking for weeks
She from the south and I come from Leeds
I'm gonna date her and Armani like meeks
And take her mind so I can clap them cheeks
Sexting we're a real set of freaks
Imagination, rippin' of the sheets
And I can feel them vibes when she on me
One and a real thing is getting deeper
Yeah, that's what I like though, so sexy cute but psycho
I wanna be fit like Michaеl, open doors and give her Michaеl
Cross the monster with gentlemen (Okay)
So fly like a pelican
Don't start experimental man
She's in my heart and that's genuine

[Chorus]
Didn't know I had you in my heart
Didn't know I had you in my heart
Didn't know I had you in my heart
Tell me that we'll never be apart
Didn't know I had you, di-didn't know I had you
Didn't know I had you in my heart
Didn't know I had you, di-didn't know I had you
Didn't know I had you in my heart

Yeah, what we got is a lot deeper, she do her thing and I do mine
I'm never gonna mistreat her, the thing that I love the most is her time
What we got is a lot deeper, she do her thing and I do mine
I'm never gonna mistreat her, the thing that I love the most is her time
So I don't stop, eye contact and I can't stop, won't stop
She want it hard and I won't flop
Kissin' in the car and then we had it in the phone box
All over the world, she arched that back, I make her toes curl
Behind all of the girls, this sweetheart she got my heart, yeah

[Chorus]
Didn't know I had you in my heart
Didn't know I had you in my heart
Didn't know I had you in my heart
Tell me that we'll never be apart
Didn't know I had you, di-didn't know I had you
Didn't know I had you in my heart
Didn't know I had you, di-didn't know I had you
Didn't know I had you in my heartEmbed
