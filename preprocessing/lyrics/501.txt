Jitterbug
Jitterbug
Jitterbug
Jitterbug

[Verse 1]
You put the boom boom into my heart
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
Jitterbug into my brain (Yeah, yeah)
Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same

[Pre-Chorus]
But something's buggin' me
Something ain't right
My best friend told me what you did last night
Left me sleepin' in my bed
I was dreamin' but I should've been with you instead

[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high
Yeah, yeah

You take the grey skies out of my way
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
Turned a bright spark into a flame (Yeah, yeah)
My beats per minute never been the same
'Cause you're my lady, I'm your fool
It makes me crazy when you act so cruel
Come on, baby, let's not fight
We'll go dancing, everything will be all right

[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby

[Post-Chorus]
Jitterbug
Jitterbug
[Bridge]
Cuddle up, baby, move in tight
We'll go dancing tomorrow night
It's cold out there, but it's warm in bed
They can dance, we'll stay home instead
Jitterbug

[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
Wake me up before you go-go
(Don't you dare, to leave me hanging on like a yo-yo-yo-yo-yo)
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
(Take me dancing)
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
(A boom-boom-boom-boom, oh)
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
(A boom-boom-boom-boom, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
Yeah, yeah19Embed
