3 ContributorsEye of the Storm LyricsI know you’re running from a tidal wave you can’t ignore
I know you’re trapped inside a hurricane, in the eye of the storm
Of the storm
Of the storm
When it feels like you can’t go on

You’re only one step away
From breaking down the walls you made
The walls you made and
I know it's hard to move on
I know it's hard to let go
But you’re only one step away
From getting out of the eye of the storm

Eye of the storm

You’re one step away
From falling off the edge
It’s messing with your hеad
It’s making you forget that you’re one stеp away
From conquering the pain
From overcoming darkness when fear’s in the way

You’re only one step away
From breaking down the walls you made
The walls you made and
I know it's hard to move on
I know it's hard to let go
But you’re only one step away
You might also likeDon't let it bury you

I know you’re running from a tidal wave you can’t ignore
I know you’re trapped inside a hurricane, in the eye of the storm

But you’re only one step away
From breaking down the walls you made
The walls you made and
I know it's hard to move on
I know it's hard to let go

(I know it’s hard to let go)

I know it's hard to move on
I know it's hard to let go

But you’re only one step away
From getting out of the eye of the storm

Eye of the storm

Don't let it bury youEmbed
