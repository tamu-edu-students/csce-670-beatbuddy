It happened so fast, crash
Hurts so good I can't look away
You keep pulling me back, back
Saying this time won't be the same
You bring out the worst in me
Think that you’re cursing me
Drive in reverse and keep saying we'll last
Until we crash, crash
Until we crash

[Verse 1: Mokita & Charlotte Sands]
Oh, I know
No matter where you go
I'll still be in your bed every morning
Take it slow
We say it but we won't
We're spinning out and losing control

[Pre-Chorus: Mokita & Charlotte Sands]
Ooh, we should walk away
Baby, we should walk away from it
Ooh, tryna to hit the brakes, but it's too late

[Chorus: Mokita & Charlotte Sands]
It happened so fast, crash
Hurts so good I can't look away
You keep pulling me back, back
Saying this time won't be the same
You bring out thе worst in me
Think that you’re cursing me
Drivе in reverse and keep saying we'll last
Until we crash, crash
Until we crash

[Verse 2: Charlotte Sands]
Oh, I know
No matter where you go
I'll still be in your head every morning
Hold me close
Cause every time you don't
I'm spinning out and losing control

[Pre-Chorus: Mokita & Charlotte Sands]
Ooh, we should walk away
Baby, we should walk away from it
Ooh, tryna to hit the brakes, but it's too late

[Chorus: Mokita & Charlotte Sands]
It happened so fast, crash
Hurts so good I can't look away
You keep pulling me back, back
Saying this time won't be the same
Bring out the worst in me
Think that you're cursing me
Drive in reverse and keep saying we'll last
Until we crash, crash
Until we crash
[Post-Chorus: Mokita & Charlotte Sands]
Until we
Until we crash
