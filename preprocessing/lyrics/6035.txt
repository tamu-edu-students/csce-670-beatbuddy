8 ContributorsNeed You Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Made a lot of money and I lost a lot, ayy
Chasing your dreams tend to cost a lot
Beat the odds and give 'em all something to talk about
Brand new whip can’t even fit inside the parking spot (Hey)
Don't think I need you, don't think I need you
Quick as I met you, I’ll leave you
Adding up my totals, figured out that we ain't equal
Masking all your flaws, end of the day, baby, you see-through
Lotta sacrifices tryna take care of my people
You say, "Play your part," and I was willing to come meet you
Flooded out your watch 'cause I ain't tripping, I don't need to, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
He gave you a hundred when he had a hundred thousand
I gave you 20 with only lint in my pocket
But I ain't nеver trippin', yeah, you got it
Karma, she a bitch who don't forgеt one thing about it

[Verse 1]
Running round in circles now we boxed in
Used to hate being alone, now we locked in
Yeah, I knew you was the one when you walked in
Made me forget about ’em all when I had options
Now I’m rolling in this Rolls-Royce
Stars in the ceiling, it don't matter
I could have it all it, still won’t matter
'Cause when I die, who knows where I'll go after
Tryna find my inner peace, yeah, that's something I gotta master
You might also like[Chorus]
Made a lot of money and I lost a lot, ayy
Chasing your dreams tend to cost a lot
Beat the odds and give ’em all something to talk about
Brand new whip can't even fit inside the parking spot (Hey)
Don't think I need you, don't think I need you
Don't think I need you, don't think I need you
Don't think I need you, don't think, don't think

[Verse 2]
Ayy, lately I been smelling myself
Ayy, money over bitches what I'm telling myself
Yeah, slow down girl, don't get ahead of yourself
Got a lot of tricks that's under my belt (Ayy)
Only time I lose is when I'm losing my feelings
The only time I'm down is when I'm down for my niggas
The only time you beg is when you beg for forgiveness
And I ain't got no love in my heart 'cause it's missing
Anything you wanted at the time, I woulda gave it to ya
I put my feelings to the side, I woulda saved it for ya
Now I don't wanna sit and talk 'bout what we coulda been
(Ayy, yeah)
You be going off impulse
Telling me your problems with your kinfolks
Yeah, I shoulda knew what I was in for
Yeah, I shoulda known that you would switch like a Nintendo
I guess everything good, I ain't good for ya what they meant though
[Chorus]
Made a lot of money and I lost a lot, ayy
Chasing your dreams tend to cost a lot
Beat the odds and give 'em all something to talk about
Brand new whip can't even fit inside the parking spot (Hey)
Don't think I need you, don't think I need you
Don't think I need you, don't think I need you
Don't think I need you, don't think, don't think2Embed
