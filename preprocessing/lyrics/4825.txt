5 ContributorsE’better Lyrics[Verse 1]
I no go mind if you pressure me
I go carry woman tension you too
My car is a EOD
But I go gather money buy lambo too
My intention
My money and my blood pressure
Dey go together anytime we turn up
Tell the Barman say the card lock up
I dey boycott

[Chorus]
Na girlfriend we dey find (We dey find)
No be business
Na kwekwe we dey drive
No be tinted (No be tinted)
Na fine face you get, you no get manners
Na big breast you get, you no gеt big yansh
Na Gucci you know, you no know good thing
E better make I singlе
E better make I single again
E better make I give you old school style
Play you osadebe
E better make I single

E better make I give you old school style
Play you osadebe
