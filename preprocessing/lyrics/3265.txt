39 ContributorsDie a King Lyrics[Intro]
HK

[Chorus]
Soak up the rag, spark up the match
Light up the night and I never look back
I am the hunter, you are the monster
I am the entity, I am the haunter
Fight with no honor, fight with no honor
Bring me the lake, I won't choke on the water
I am the author, you are the paper
Rip you apart, leave the blood on the razor

[Post-Chorus]
Motherfucker I am the product of never feeling my feelings
I run up on em' in the middle of the night and I kill em'
I drill a hole in the building to fill the void I been missing
Can't tell me shit I don't listen, I'm burning up with the witches
Always been the same and I'll never change
Drift in the waves and I'm swept away
Catch me with the flames, I'ma decimate
And if I rest today I'll just accept my fate

[Verse]
This is how I feel, am I really here?
Dwell on every fear
There's no healing me hear me out
Show me who I was
Patiently faithfully chasing the sun
Drag me down, deep into the ground
Seep into the weakness, gotta get the secret out
I am alone inside my head
I can't be killed if I'm already dead
Heartless entity, double identity
Look at me, look at me
See what you did to me
Look at you, look at you
This is the end of you
Thought I was done
But bitch this is the interlude
I would be cautious, watch where you step
I am your conscience, I am your breath
I am the sovereign, never to rest
I will break down your will until nothing is left

I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king

[Chorus]
Soak up the rag, spark up the match
Light up the night and I never look back
I am the hunter, you are the monster
I am the entity, I am the haunter
Fight with no honor, fight with no honor
Bring me the lake, I won't choke on the water
I am the author, you are the paper
Rip you apart, leave the blood on the razor

[Post-Chorus]
Motherfucker I am the product of never feeling my feelings
I run up on em' in the middle of the night and I kill em'
I drill a hole in the building to fill the void I been missing
Can't tell me shit I don't listen, I'm burning up with the witches
Always been the same and I'll never change
Drift in the waves and I'm swept away
Catch me with the flames, I'ma decimate
And if I rest today I'll just accept my fate
[Refrain]
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king25Embed
