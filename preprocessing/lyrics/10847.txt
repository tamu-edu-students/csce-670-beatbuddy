8 ContributorsSilence Lyrics[Verse 1: Manas]
What if all these conversations led to nothing?
What if everything you told me was a lie?
I would give myself to you just to feel something
But I believe that you would leave me behind

[Pre-Chorus: Marco Luka]
Keep me in your mind, you can meet me anytime
If you read between the lines, my darling, you could see the other side

[Chorus: Marco Luka]
So was it ever real?
Or did you feel
Everything that I did?
The things I couldn't hear
They were so clear
But I mistook your silence

[Verse 2: Tanu]
Weed smoke hitting on my lungs
Backwoods helping me erase it
No matter what I do, it's not enough
I could fuck it up and never say shit
I took a trip to see who'd I'd become
Nobody ever tells you that it's dangerous
A danger to my city, but I'm loved
Call me what you want, but you a lame bitch, yeah, oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Marco Luka]
Keep me in your mind, you can meet me anytime
If you read between the lines, my darling, you could see the other side

[Chorus: Marco Luka]
So was it ever real?
Or did you feel
Everything that I did?
The things I couldn't hear
They were so clear
But I mistook your silenceEmbed
