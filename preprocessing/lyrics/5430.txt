I don't live in California, I'll inform you, that's not where I reside
I'm just a tenant, paying rent inside this body and I
Got two windows, and those windows, well, I call them my eyes
I'm just going where the wind blows, I don't get to decide

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I think too much, yeah, I get so caught up
I'm always stuck in my head
I wish I could escape, I tried to yesterday
Took all the sheets off my bed

[Chorus]
Then I tied up my linen with five strips of ribbon I found
Scaled the side of the building, I ran to the hills 'til they found me
And they put me back in my cell, all by myself
Alone with my thoughts again
Guess my mind is a prison and I'm never gonna get out

[Verse 2]
So they tranquilized me, analyzed me, threw me back in my cage
Then they tied me to an IV, told me I was insane
I'm a prisoner, a visitor inside of my brain
And no matter what I do, they try to keep me in chains

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I think too much, yeah, I get so caught up
I'm always stuck in my head
I wish I could escape, I tried to yesterday
Took all the sheets off my bed

Then I tied up my linen with five strips of ribbon I found
Scaled the side of the building, I ran to the hills 'til they found me
And they put me back in my cell, all by myself
Alone with my thoughts again
Guess my mind is a prison and I'm never gonna get out

[Bridge]
Said even if it's true, no matter what I do
I'm never gonna escape
I won't give up on hope, secure another rope
And try for another day
Said even if it's true, no matter what I do
I'm never gonna escape
I won't give up on hope, secure another rope
And try for another day

[Chorus]
Then I tied up my linen with five strips of ribbon I found
Scaled the side of the building, I ran to the hills 'til they found me
And they put me back in my cell, all by myself
Alone with my thoughts again
Guess my mind is a prison and I'm never gonna get out26Embed
