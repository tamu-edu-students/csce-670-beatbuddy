3 ContributorsOne in a Million Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' 'bout you again
Secret just for me and my friends
I didn't want to tell you
'Cause I knew that shit would go to your head
But now I've got this drink in my hand
I take another sip and say

[Chorus]
You're one in a million
You give me that feeling, I want it all day
I know that we're different, but it makes no difference
I think you should stay

[Verse 2]
Why don't we dance?
Fuck, you look good when I'm faded
I'll give you a chance, let you be my new favorite now
Get everybody talkin' 'bout us
No more playin' tough, now I’ve drank enough
So why don't we dance, so I can finally say how I feel?
I takе another sip and say

[Chorus]
You're one in a million
You givе me that feeling, I want it all day
I know that we're different, but it makes no difference
I think you should stay
You might also like[Bridge]
Everything about us is nice
Everything about it is right
We're sweet like sugar and spice, baby
Everything about us is nice
Everything about it is right
We're sweet like sugar and spice, baby

[Chorus]
You're one in a million
You give me that feeling, I want it all day (Well, I want it all day, now)
I know that we're different, but it makes no difference
I think you should stay
You're one in a million
You give me that feeling, I want it all dayEmbed
