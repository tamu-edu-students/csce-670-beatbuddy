7 ContributorsIf You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, if you want to sing out, sing out
And if you want to be free, be free
'Cause there's a million things to be
You know that there are

[Verse 2]
And if you want to live high, live high
And if you want to live low, live low
'Cause there's a million ways to go
You know that there are

[Chorus]
You can do what you want, the opportunity's on
And if you find a new way, you can do it today
You can make it all true and you can make it undo
You see, it's easy, you only need to know

[Verse 3]
Well, if you want to say yes, say yes
And if you want to say no, say no
'Cause there's a million ways to go
You know that there are

[Verse 4]
And if you want to be me, be me
And if you want to be you, be you
'Cause there's a million things to do
You know that there are
You might also like[Chorus]
You can do what you want, the opportunity's on
And if you find a new way, you can do it today
You can make it all true and you can make it undo
You see, it's easy, you only need to know

[Verse 1]
Well, if you want to sing out, sing out
And if you want to be free, be free
'Cause there's a million things to be
You know that there are

[Outro]
You know that there are
You know that there are
You know that there are
You know that there are
You know that there are2Embed
