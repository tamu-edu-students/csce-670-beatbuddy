19 ContributorsStuck in the Middle Lyrics[Intro]
You know what she said to me?

[Verse 1]
She said, "You're a player, aren't you?
And I bet you got hoes"
I said, "You don't know me like that
I just go with the flow, oh, oh"
She said, "You can't fool me like that
You're gonna leave me on read"
I said, "Why don't you try me on out?
I know you wanna be friends"

[Pre-Chorus]
But friends turn into sleepovers
And sleepovers turn into love
Love turns into jealousy
And now we both fucked up

[Chorus]
'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends
And we're losing every part of the benefits
You hurt me more than I ever knew
But it's shitty 'cause I'm doing the same to you

[Verse 2]
She said, "Are we exclusive or not?" (Exclusive or not)
I said, "What do you wanna do?
Seems like you love me a lot" (Seems like you love me a lot)
She said, "Can we stop the joking
And take me seriously?" (Take me seriously)
I said, "I'll try my very best
But we'll have to wait and see" (Let's wait and see)

'Cause talks turn into sleepless nights
And sleepless nights turn into love (Turn into love)
Love turns into impatience
And now we both fucked up (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends (Lovers and friends)
And we're losing every part of the benefits (Losing benefits)
You hurt me more than I ever knew (Than I ever knew)
But it's shitty 'cause I'm doing the same to you

[Bridge]
Stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle with you (Hey, hey)
Stuck in the middle (Stuck in the middle)
Stuck in the middle with you (Hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Because fights turn into making up
And making up turns into love (Turns into love)
Love turns into forever (Forever)
And that scares both of us (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends (Lovers and friends)
And we're losing every part of the benefits (Hey, hey)
You hurt me more than I ever knew
But it's shitty 'cause I'm doing the same to you8Embed
