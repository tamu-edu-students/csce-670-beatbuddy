35 ContributorsMaggot Brain Lyrics[George Clinton]
Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time
For y'all have knocked her up
I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe
I was not offended
For I knew I had to rise above it all
Or drown in my own shit
[Instrumental Break]

[George Clinton]
Go on, maggot brain
Go on, maggot brain
