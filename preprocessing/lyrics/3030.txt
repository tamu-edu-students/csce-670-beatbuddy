86 ContributorsDa Rockwilder Lyrics[Intro: Redman]
(Oh my god)
Oh my god
Boo
Uh, uh, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Microphone checka, swingin' sword lecture
Closin' down the sector, supreme neck protector
Better warn 'em kid, Mr. Meth's a boiling pot
'Bout to blow his lid from the pressure, too hot for TV
For sheesy, too many wanna be hard, be easy
It's all N'together, going all out together
It don't take much to please me
Still homes, I'm never satisfied like the Stones
We don't condone bitin', see them skull and crossbones
Protecting what I'm writing
Don't clash with the Titan who blast with a license
To kill rap recitings
Come on, in the zone with ya nigga from the Group Home TICAL (Fuck your lifestyle)
Put your lights out
Get the shit to crackin', got you fiending with your pipes out
Time for some action
Surfin' the avenue, mad at you, where I used to battle crews
Back when Antoinette had that attitude
Cover me, I'm going in, walls closing in
Got us bustin' off these pistols, my niggas got issues
Again, same song armed with the mega bomb
Blow you out the frame and then I'm gone

Yo, I was gone too but we roam, cellular phones
Doc, Meth back in the flesh, blood and bones
Don't condone, spend bank loans on homegrown
Suckers break like Turbo and Ozone
When I grab the broom
Moon-walk platoon hawk, my goons bark
Leave you in a blue lagoon lost (True)
Three nines in the glove with Masu, D-Don and The Gov'
Right behind on a bus
Haters don't touch (What?)
Weigh us both up
Now my neighbor doped up
Got the cable hooked up
All channels, lift my shirt, all mammal
You ship off keys and we ship Grand Pianos
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin' on a forty, yo, smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun, y'all, Red and Meth didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, come on
Red and Meth didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la44Embed
