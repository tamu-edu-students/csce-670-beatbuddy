56 ContributorsYou Only Live Once Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some people think they're always right
Others are quiet and uptight
Others, they seem so very nice-nice-nice-nice, oh
Inside they might feel sad and wrong, oh no
Twenty-nine different attributes
Only seven that you like, oh
Twenty ways to see the world, oh
And twenty ways to start a fight, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, don't, don't, don't get up!
I can't see the sunshine
I'll be waiting for you, baby
'Cause I'm through
Sit me down!
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

[Verse 2]
Oh, men don't notice what they got
Oh, women think of that a lot
One thousand ways to please your man, oh
Not even one requires a plan, I know
And countless odd religions too
It doesn't matter which you choose, oh no
One stubborn way to turn your back, oh
This I've tried and now refuse, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, don't, don't, don't get up!
I can't see the sunshine
Whoa, I'll be waiting for you, baby
'Cause I'm through
Sit me down!
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you, alright

[Outro]
Shut me up
Shut me up
And I'll get along with you57Embed
