Don't hold back, 'cause you woke up in the morning
With initiative to move, so why make it harder?
Don't hold back, if you think about it
So many people do, be cool man, look smarter
Don't hold back, and you shouldn't even care
'Bout the losers in the air and their crooked stares
Don't hold back, 'cause there's a party over here
So you might as well be here where the people care

[Hook: The Chemical Brothers & Q-Tip]
Don't hold back, world (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
Galvanize
Come on, come on, come on with it

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Don't hold back, if you think about it too much
You may stumble, trip up, fall on your face
Don't hold back, you think it's time you get up
Crunch time like a sit-up, c'mon keep pace
Don't hold back, put apprehension on the back burner
Let it sit, don't even get it lit
Don't hold back, get involved with the jam
Don't be a prick, hot chick be a pig

Don't hold back, world (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
Galvanize
Come on with that, come on with it

[Outro: Q-Tip]
World, the time has come to (Push the button)
World, the time has come to (Push the button)
World, the time has come to (Push the button)
World, my finger is on the button
My finger is on the button
My finger is on the button (Push the button)
The time has come to
