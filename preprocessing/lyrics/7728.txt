18 ContributorsRun to You Lyrics[Verse 1]
The city sky's feeling dark tonight
We're back to back with our heads down
Just look at me, give me more tonight
Just give me more of your love now

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's set fire to the lonely night
You're beautiful when you look at me
Let's give love another life

[Chorus]
'Cause you'll be safe in these arms of mine
Just call my name on the edge of the night
And I'll run to you, I'll run to you

[Verse 2]
I would run to you, if you want me to
Just give me some kind of reason
I would take the pain, take it all away
Just give it some kind of meaning

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's let go, let it be the start
You know I'm feeling the same thing
Let's let go of our broken hearts
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause you'll be safe in these arms of mine
Just call my name on the edge of the night
And I'll run to you, I'll run to you

[Bridge]
Even if it's gonna break me, love
Gonna make my way to you
Anyway it's gonna take me, love
I run to you
I run to you
Run, run

[Chorus]
'Cause you'll be safe in these arms of mine
Just call my name on the edge of the night
And I'll run to you, I'll run to you

[Outro]
Even if it's gonna break me, love
I run to you6Embed
