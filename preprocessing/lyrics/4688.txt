16 ContributorsAwake Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wait another minute, can't you see
What this pain has fuckin' done to me?
I'm alive and still kickin', what you see, I can't see
And maybe you'll think before you speak

[Chorus]
I'm alive, for you
I'm awake, because of you
I'm alive, told you
I'm awake, swallowin' you

[Verse 2]
Take another second, turn your back on me
And make-believe that you're always happy
It's safe to say, you're never alive, a big part of you has died
And by the way, I hope you're satisfied

[Chorus]
I'm alive, for you
I'm awake, because of you
I'm alive, told you
I'm awake, swallowin' you
I'm alive, for you
I'm awake, because of you
I'm alive, told you
I'm awake

Tearin' it back, unveilin' me
Takin' a step back so I can breathe
Hear the silence about to break
Fear resistance when I'm awake
Tearin' it back, unveilin' me
Takin' a step back so I can breathe
Hear the silence about to break
Fear resistance when I'm awake
Ooh, yeah!

[Interlude]
Ah, yeah!

[Chorus]
I'm alive, for you
I'm awake, because of you
I'm alive, told you
I'm awake, swallowin' you
I'm alive, for you
I'm awake, because of you
I'm alive, told you
I'm awake, swallowin' you7Embed
