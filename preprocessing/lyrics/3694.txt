Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

[Verse 1]
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Flew away howling on the yellow moon

[Chorus]
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

[Verse 2]
People cry and people moan
Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own

[Chorus]
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July
