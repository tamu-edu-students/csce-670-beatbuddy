6 ContributorsHouse of Glass Lyrics[Verse 1]
At least I can say I tried
At least I can say I wanted this
More than you did
‘Cause I call you every day
And it goes right to voice mail and I know
That it’s stupid

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That I still want you back
Even though you left
Without saying goodbye
You just cut off the ties
Yeah, I still want you close
Still want your hand to hold
Was I a fool to think that we’d grow old?

[Chorus]
Oh, this house of glass was never made to last
Got the windows stained with memories from our past
And as we drift apart, it all begins to crack
It took so long to build, but all fell down so fast

[Verse 2]
There's shards of glass all around
And I wanna pick them off the ground
And put them back together
But to pick the pieces up
Is to suffer all the cuts
To make things better
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
‘Cause I still see your ghost
When I am all alone
Oh, my minds a mess
It’s like you never left
‘Cause your love follows me
This feeling's haunting me
It’s all I’ve ever known
Why can’t I let you go?

[Chorus]
Oh, this house of glass was never made to last
Got the windows stained with memories from our past
And as we drift apart, it all begins to crack
It took so long to build, but all fell down so fast

[Chorus]
Oh, this house of glass was never made to last
Got the windows stained from memories from our past
And as we drift apart, it all begins to crack
It took so long to build, but all fell down so fast2Embed
