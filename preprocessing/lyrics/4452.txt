Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch

[Chorus]
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down
Don't hold me up now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry and the cold
We are the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told (Oh, oh, oh)
But we've been sweating while you slept so calm in the safety of your home
We've been pulling out the nails that hold up everything you've known

Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down
Don't hold me up now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down

[Bridge]
So open your eyes, child, let's be on our way (Hey, hey)
Broken windows and ashes are guiding the way (Hey, hey)
Keep quiet no longer, we'll sing through the day (Hey, hey)
Of the lives that we've lost and the lives we've reclaimed
Go

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down
Don't hold me up now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down
[Outro]
Don't hold me up (I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up (I don't need your help)
No, no, no
Don't hold me up (I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up (I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't let me down, down, down, down, down24Embed
