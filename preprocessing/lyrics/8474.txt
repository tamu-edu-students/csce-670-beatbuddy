(Here we go)
Break it down again

[Verse 1]
So those are my dreams
And these are my eyes
Stand tall like a man
Headstrong like a horse

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
(Ooh, ooh)
In the world of secrets
In the world of sound
(Ooh)

[Chorus]
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
See for yourself, you have been sitting on a time bomb
No revolution, maybe someone, somewhere else
Could show you something new about you and your inner song
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground (Break it down again)
I wanna break it down (Break it down again)
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Break it down again

[Verse 2]
So those are my schemes
And these are my plans
Hot tips for the boys
Fresh news from the force

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
(Ooh, ooh)
In the world of silence
In the world of sound
(Ooh)

[Chorus]
"No sleep for dreaming", say the architects of life
Big bouncing babies, bread and butter, can I have a slice?
They make no mention of the beauty of decay
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella, save it for a rainy day
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground (Break it down again)
I wanna break it down (Break it down again)
[Bridge]
Horsin' around
Pray to the power
Play to the crowd with your big hit sound
And they won't simmer, won't simmer, won't simmer down
Play to the crowd
"Hey", to the crowd
Play, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
Fast off to heaven just like Moses on a motorbike
No revolution, maybe someone, somewhere else
Could show you something new
To help with the ups and downs (Break it down again)
I wanna break it down (Break it down again)
Break it down again (Break it down again)
Break it down again (Break it down again, here we go)

[Outro]
Break it down again
No more sleepy dreaming
No more building up
It is time to dissolve
Break it down it again
No more sleepy dreaming1Embed
