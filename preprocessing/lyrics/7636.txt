Uwena isicalo nesiphetho
Umnini mandla wonke
Uwena baba ongasinceda
Impilo indzima ngaphandle kwakho

Sthembe wena
Sfuna Wena
Akekho ongasilwela
Sthembe wena
Sfuna Wena
Sisondela kuwe

Verse 1

Kundzima empilweni

Covid 19 shaye wonke umunftu labanye ba-luze misebenti

Lebanye bahambile emhlabeni

Bread winners

Angati kutsi sibaleke siyephi

Will get it and Live alright... ( hho)

Looks like we losing the fight... ( hho )

We live in the tough times ( hho)

Like children raped by their own fathers

Ohhh no...

Who is gonna protect them from the vultures

All valid reasons make them lose hope

However, your love never fails.... oh no

Help us fight the good fight of faith

Even when the people call us names

They Think they are  better saved
What they preach they don’t walk

Feels like it was better when we were lost

Verse 2

People dying like water into the sand

And still no justice served

Parents beaten up by their own children
Children trafficked and mama hasn’t eaten for days

Everything will be okay in the end

And if it’s not okay, it’s not the end”

That’s John Lennon

Fight like Biko

Baba sinikeze amadla njengo Samson

I’m holding on the pillars But they hurt like thorns

Like labantu laba bengibasiz’ izol’

Now They turn blind man

Coz I need their help

But let’s not lose hope

I’m Counting everything you blessed me with

You never took me this far in order to leave

You see something...

We forget everything ..... because of a moment

Being

The pain we feel

See

The greatness within

But let’s not lose hope
