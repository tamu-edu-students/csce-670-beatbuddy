30 ContributorsSuperman (It’s Not Easy) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
I'm just out to find
The better part of me

[Chorus]
I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane
I'm more than some pretty face beside a train
And it's not easy to be me

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

[Chorus]
It may sound absurd, but don't be naive
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed, but won't you concede?
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

[Bridge]
Up, up, and away, away from me
Well, it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

[Chorus]
I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Diggin' for kryptonite on this one-way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Lookin' for special things inside of me

[Outro]
Inside of me
Inside of me
Yeah, inside of me
Inside of me
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I'm only a man lookin' for a dream
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
And it's not easy, hoo, hoo, hoo
It's not easy to be me11Embed
