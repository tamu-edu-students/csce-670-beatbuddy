[Chorus]
엉덩이 빵빵빵
남자들은 탐탐탐
내 입술 냠냠냠
어딜가든 당당당
등장은 차차차
뛰자뛰자 방방방
디스코 팡팡팡
Hello, bitches

[Refrain]
나-나-나, 나-나, 나-나, 나-나-나
나-나-나, 나-나, 나-나, 나-나-나
나-나-나, 나-나, 나-나, 나-나-나
나-나-나, 나-나, 나-나, 나-나-나

[Verse 1]
난 지금 어디야? Shopping spree in Tokyo
Wake up in my private jet, 매일 아침 또띠아
Lifting cards in Macau, 내가 제일 잘나가
Stop blowing up my phone and won't you hit me up on Kakao?
Diamonds in my grill 날 말려 누가?
Skin tone 2-2 karats gold I got in Dubai
My boys won't hesitate to run up on your boys
(My boys won't hesitate to run up on your boys)

[Verse 2]
Yellow gold and it glow like a yellow phone?
Couldn't see me with a selfie from my telephone
Got hella dough, Hello Kitty getting hella old
Want me to love them long time and I tell 'em no
Sake to soju Nagasaki to Seoul
You can find me in Shanghai
You know what those shots of Baijiu do
Got these Asian girls dancing on the couches, yeah, they know me
And they singing every word like they was at the karaoke, huh
