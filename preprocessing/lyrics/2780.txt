I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

[Bridge]
The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

[Verse 2]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from
The squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

[Verse 3]
There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second-guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

[Bridge]
Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers

[Outro]
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
And I know the pieces fit41Embed
