5 ContributorsLost Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm feeling strange
Funny how in the blink of an eye, time slips away
My little brother is six feet tall and my friends have changed
Even though on the outside they still look the same as yesterday

[Chorus]
And this is my confession, I'm fighting off depression
I look fine but look behind my eyes
I'm pacing 'round the kitchen, I'm tryna shake this feeling
I'm not fine and haven't been fine for a while

[Post-Chorus]
I'm lost, so lost, so lost
I'm lost, so lost

[Verse 2]
Lately, I've been scared to pray
And I'm aware that something that I probably should not say
So, mum, please, can you cover your ears? I'm not a Saint (Oh no)
I can't wash away the blood on my hands, I'm in need of grace

[Chorus]
And this is my confession, I'm fighting off depression
I look fine but look behind my eyes
I'm pacing 'round the kitchen, I'm tryna shake this feeling
I'm not fine and haven't been fine for a while

I'm lost, so lost, so lost
I'm lost, so lost

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
I'm lost, so lost, so lost
I'm lost, so lostEmbed
