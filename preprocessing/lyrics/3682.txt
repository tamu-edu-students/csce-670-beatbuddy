13 ContributorsUCLA Lyrics[Chorus]
She just moved to LA
Go to UCLA
And she drive a Maserati
Damn, she got a body
She be tryna party
She be tryna party
She just moved to LA
Go to UCLA
And she drive a Maserati
Damn, she got a body
She be tryna party
She be tryna party

[Verse 1]
Surf board shawty, she just caught the wave
24 been gettin' paid
Diamonds in the watch, no shades
All these lights on the train an arcade
Pop one pill, pop two pills
Roll, roll, roll, now she goin' downhill
And she was born in Texas
So you know she flexin'
Shawty got style, I can tell how she dressin'

[Drop]
She just moved to LA
She be tryna party
She be tryna party
She just moved to LA
She be tryna party
She be tryna party

She ain't used to the weather
She been rockin' old clothes
Fucked up last night, today she a no-show
She don't like to go to class
Rather hit a party, study, that's hardly
Papa got money, red Maserati
She just met new friends
They just wanna stay out
'Til the sun come up
They just wanna party
Tell 'em somethin' came up
She just wanna party
She don't wanna change up

[Chorus]
She just moved to LA
Go to UCLA
And she drive a Maserati
Damn, she got a body
She be tryna party
She be tryna party
She just moved to LA
Go to UCLA
And she drive a Maserati
Damn, she got a body
She be tryna party
She be tryna party
[Drop]
She just moved to LA
She be tryna party
She be tryna party
She just moved to LA
She be tryna party
She be tryna party1Embed
