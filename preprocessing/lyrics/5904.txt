47 ContributorsMidnight Thoughts Lyrics[Verse]
Yo, I throw on a facade and then, act like I’m alright
Say I’ll go to sleep but then I’ll stay up all night
And honestly, I think that there's something very wrong with me
Writing down these lines but they just do not seem like songs to me
I usually spend the night, locked inside my head
Thoughts about my ex and the days that I will be dead
Mood is suicidal, this is just me in denial
Burn my feelings in a pile, I can’t find the strength to smile
Say they tired of the sad shit, sorry, that is how I feel
Ain't nobody bumps my shit, I’m sorry that I lacked appeal
I just wanna cruise around, kick it with the top down
Taller than these fools, but they still wanna talk down
Like what did I do to spite you? Don’t wanna fight you
Chillin’ in the darkness, I’m just tryna spread some light, dude
And lately I have noticed that they hate everything I do
I don’t see the point to life, so I spark up like Raichu
And honestly I’m sorry if I ever caused you pain
But it will be erased with a bullet to the brain
Slit my wrists with the razor that I use to sever ties
I hate when girls I love move on to the better guys
I’m tired of missing people that will never miss me
See the pain inside my eyes and every time it gets me
And I know I’m not good enough for anyone to love me
I’m really not that funny and most people think I’m ugly
I’m sorry that I’m not enough, sorry that I’m not that tough
I know my body’s not that buff but maybe I can still find love
And Cupids just another demon, sent to haunt me
Say I wanna move on, but then old feelings stop me
I’m sorry
I’m sorryYou might also like25Embed
