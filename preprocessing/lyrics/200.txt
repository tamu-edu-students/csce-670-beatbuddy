[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
You might also like[Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
[Instrumental Break]
Ooh!

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-yeah
Woah, yeah
Woah, oh, h-o
Sweet child of mine
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Sweet love of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet child of mine, ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Sweet love of mine
[Guitar Solo]
