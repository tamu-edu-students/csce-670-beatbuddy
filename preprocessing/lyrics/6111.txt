16 ContributorsHoney, Honey Lyrics[Verse 1: Agnetha & Frida]
Honey, honey, how you thrill me, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, nearly kill me, aha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy

[Verse 2: Agnetha & Frida]
Honey, honey, let me feel it, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, don't conceal it, aha, honey honey
The way that you kiss goodnight
(The way that you kiss me goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight
(The way that you're holding me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing

[Chorus: Björn and Agnetha & Frida]
I don't wanna hurt you, baby, I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you, boy, you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be

[Verse 3: Agnetha & Frida]
Honey, honey, touch me, baby, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, hold me, baby, aha, honey honey
You look like a movie star
(You look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are
(I know just who you are)
And, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast
You might also like[Chorus: Björn and Agnetha & Frida]
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be

[Verse 4: Agnetha & Frida]
Honey, honey, how you thrill me, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, nearly kill me, aha, honey honey
I heard about you before
(I heard about you before)
I wanted to know some more
(I wanted to know you some more)
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy5Embed
