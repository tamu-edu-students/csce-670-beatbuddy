Listening to the great beyond
Where misdirection waves its magic wand
Everybody sing that song
Tuesday morning comes along
I read the news, it's all gone wrong
The facts of life have left too soon
The serving up doom and gloom
Never gonna leave my room
Black Capricorn will blow the horn
For all the love that can't be born today
Everybody walk away

[Chorus]
Set 'em on up to knock 'em all down
And take me to your leader where the makeup
Is fake as fuck
Strap it on in to map it on out
Spin doctors wanna makе you think it's straight up
Just out of luck

Set 'em on up to knock 'em all down
And takе me to your leader where the makeup
Is fake as fuck
Strap it on in to map it on out
Spin doctors wanna make you think you're straight up
Just out of luck

Friday afternoon is cool
I lost my faith in Sunday school
Deliver me from Liverpool
I feel just like an April fool
Someone gotta break that rule

Sticking to the script
We built another sinking ship
She's so alone
Never gonna leave my home

Mother nature can't go wrong
The science God's forever strong
A-floating in a great beyond
Everybody sing along
Everybody rock that song

[Chorus]
Set 'em on up to knock 'em all down
And take me to your leader where the makeup
Is fake as fuck
Strap it on in to map it on out
Spin doctors wanna make you think you're straight up
Just out of luck
Because you're yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Set 'em on up to knock 'em all down
And take me to your leader where the makeup
Is fake as fuck
Strap it on in to map it on out
Spin doctors wanna make you think you're straight up
Just out of luck

[Outro]
I'm a lonely, lonely lord
Searching all night for the wrong reward
An appetite that's running on all fours
Misdirection waves its wand
Turning my head from black to blonde
Like a queen will now become the pawn

Busted on a ship gone, take me home
Mother named faith, made lightning chrome
Busted on a ship that's sailing through the foam
I'm a lonely, lonely lord
Pick another day to be restored
Just another fate that's going overboard2Embed
