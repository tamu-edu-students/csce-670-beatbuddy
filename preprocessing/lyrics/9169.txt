4 ContributorsTake You On LyricsI look at people
And I wonder all day
Who are you
When you are not the one in your way
And then I think about myself in that state
I'm pretty boss
Who gone melt your brainwaves
I'm freak in the sheets
But I got a class
Imma grab a knife if you want in
Best you ever had
Give it to you bad, ooh

I'm the girl that they don't talk about
Quiet with a big mouth
Listen for the doubt
Then call it
Make you out for what you say to me
Look at every single deed
If you got what I need then, oh
I'll take you on like big deal
Legs you can unseal
Key in ignition
Just keep me full like I had a meal
Once in a while feel on my life
You might also likeI know you like it
Can't fight it
Imma let you ride the wave
I'm New York
And you're LA
Come together feel the shockwaves, ahEmbed
