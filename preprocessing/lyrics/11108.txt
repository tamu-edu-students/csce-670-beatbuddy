Some resist the future, some refuse the past
Either way, it's messed up if we can't unplug the fact
That a world covered in cables was never wired to last
So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash

[Pre-Chorus]
(How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
You're like a phantom greeting me
We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows
Stuck in a loop for eternity

[Chorus]
Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

[Verse 2]
Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass
But names can dig so many graves, you won't know where to stand
And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed
And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a show
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
(How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
You're like a phantom greeting me
We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows
Stuck in a loop for eternity

[Chorus]
Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
Yeah

[Breakdown]
Alright, you call this a connection?
You call this a connection?
You call this a connection? Okay
You call this a connection?
Oh, give me a break
Oh, give me a break
Oh, give me a break (Okay)
Ugh, ooh
[Chorus]
Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah

[Outro]
Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden30Embed
