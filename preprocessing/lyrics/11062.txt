9 ContributorsAlone With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I love you, I hate it, I can't get through
I've tried to re-name it to a face not you
But it can't be contained and
It just won't do
What I want, so I'll let it out
My body's been aching from time's hard weight
And I'm sorry for shaking in your steady grace
But I'll say it if you say it, but I won't go first
If you want to leave, then walk me out

[Chorus]
Let's go get lost on a long back road
Where the river turns to streams and the time moves slow
It's not anything you say, anywhere we go
It's just being alone with you now
Being alone with you

[Verse 2]
Either death like a shadow or love like a light
Every step it must follow, then stay back and fight
For what you laid down or stood for in your life's great breath
We sigh out, but we never die

[Chorus]
So let's go get lost on a long back road
Where the river turns to streams and the time moves slow
It's not anything you say, anywhere we go
It's just being alone with you now
Being alone with you, that's right
You might also like[Bridge]
Let's save our breath

[Chorus]
Let's go get lost on a long back road
Where the river turns to streams and the time moves slow
It's not anything you say, anywhere we go
It's just being alone with you now
Let's go get lost on a long back road
Where the river turns to streams and the time moves slow
It's not anything you say, anywhere we go
It's just being alone with you now
Being alone with you now
Being aloneEmbed
