7 ContributorsBlue Jeans LyricsCalling you late at night
Talking bout nothin'
But we’re always laughing

These dumb conversations
They raise my affections
Those were the good times
And I miss the old times

Have I told you lately
That I miss you badly

Sometimes I wish
That I could still call you mine
Still call you mine
Now all I’ve got is
The stain on my blue jeans
The only way I could
Remember that you were once mine

Your voice were lullabies
I would be list’nin’
Till I was sleeping
But our situations
It stopped our relations
Why did we end it?
Don’t want to believe it
You might also likeCuz I’m feelin lately
That I miss you badly

Sometimes I wish
That I could still call you mine
Still call you mine
Now all I’ve got is
The stain on my blue jeans
The only way I could
Remember that you were once mine


Sometimes I wish
That I could still call you mine
Still call you mine
Now all I’ve got is
The stain on my blue jeans
The only way I could
Remember that you were once mineEmbed
