11 ContributorsFWYTYK Lyrics[Intro: Brian Burkheiser]
They said this record isn't ever gonna make it
They say just fall in line and go put out the same shit
They tell me pushing limits only gets you hated
Yeah, but where were they when I was in my basement?

[Verse 1: Brian Burkheiser]
Can somebody tell me why
The more I see my enemies the more I feel alive?
The more that they wish death to me, the more I nevеr die?
I can hear 'em yеlling rest in peace, and that's the sound I like
Yeah, success is never destiny, it's all a frame of mind

[Verse 2: Eric Vanlerberghe]
The moment I created
Your mind is overtaken
You feel the fear creeping in but you never face it
So unoriginal, it's unforgivable
So strike a match, pour the gas, watch it all explode

[Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Fuck what you think you know, just be a ghost
Or you'll find out what it's like when I'm coming for your throat
Everybody knows I did this alone
I got a lot of thoughts up in this brain that I can't control
Fuck what you think you know, just let it go
There are answers to your questions that I promise you don't wanna know
Everybody knows I did this alone
Heavy lies the crown if you're comin' for the throne
See I Prevail LiveGet tickets as low as $33You might also like[Verse 3: Brian Burkheiser and Eric Vanlerberghe]
So say goodbye
'Cause everything and anything you think about is mine
You feel it sinking deeper as I occupy your mind
Yeah, the more you try and fight it it'll only multiply
So save your breath, this is do it or die, because
When you're on top you're hated
And when you're not they're claimin'
They got your back, but the fact is they hope you're failing
It's unmistakable and so predictable
But don't think that I'd ever consider to quit
I'm never gonna stop 'til I'm the greatest to live, yeah

[Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Fuck what you think you know, just be a ghost
Or you'll find out what it's like when I'm coming for your throat
Everybody knows I did this alone
I got a lot of thoughts up in this brain that I can't control
Fuck what you think you know, just let it go
There are answers to your questions that I promise you don't wanna know
Everybody knows I did this alone
Heavy lies the crown if you're comin' for the throne

[Refrain: Brian Burkheiser]
They say this record isn't ever gonna make it
They say just fall in line and go put out the same shit
They tell me pushing limits only gets you hated
But where were they when I was in my basement?
[Outro: Eric Vanlerberghe]
In all your life
In all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain
It was all the same thing
It was all the same dream
And like a lot of dreams, there's a monster at the end of it
