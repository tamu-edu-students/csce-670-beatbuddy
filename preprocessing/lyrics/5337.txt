11 ContributorsMeet Me in Amsterdam Lyrics[Verse 1]
I would sail across the world
Row this boat from dusk till dawn
To a place where we belong
Girl your body is calling me

[Pre-Chorus]
There ain’t no sunshine, no sunshine
Where I was before
But I found the Love the warmth in your arms

[Chorus]
Won’t you come closer, let it take over
I don’t need anything, I just want you

[Verse 2]
When I saw her in my dreams
Never thought it meant a thing
Till I felt and touched her skin
When she smiles, my knees go weak

[Pre-Chorus]
There ain’t no sunshine, no sunshine
Where I was before
But I found the Love the warmth in your arms
You might also like[Chorus]
Won’t you come closer, let it take over
I don’t need anything, I just want you

[Outro]
If there is a next time
If there is a next time
Meet me in Amsterdam
Meet me in Amsterdam

Meet me in Amsterdam
Meet me in Amsterdam
Meet me in Amsterdam
Meet me in Amsterdam

Meet me in Amsterdam
Meet me in Amsterdam
Meet me in Amsterdam
Meet me in AmsterdamEmbed
