Turn away
If you could, get me a drink
Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded
Call my Aunt Marie
Help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors

[Chorus]
My sisters and my brothers, still
I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

[Verse 2]
Now turn away
'Cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony
Know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo

[Chorus]
But counting down the days to go
It just ain't living
And I just hope you know

That if you say (If you say)
Goodbye today (Goodbye today)
I'd ask you to be true (I'd ask you to be true)
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
