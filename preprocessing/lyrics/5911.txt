7 ContributorsKnow me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lie to your face about my mind
So I see you with a smile
I don't care about you
Nor do I wish that you could've changed
Not satisfied with you and me
Love was all we really need
Keep my love and honesty
You'll never know the other me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm dancin' alone inside my head
Somebody save me
Do you know how I'm thinkin' now?
I'm locked up in love
I'll say the words you always made me
Baby, you know what is goin' down

[Chorus]
Do you know the fight
To keep you by my side?
This love will never change
But I just might go insane
Do you know me now?
So I can see a smile
This love will never grow
But at least you'll nеver know
You might also like[Verse 2]
Used to keep my mind besidе the place you like
Never wanted you to hear the words I sing inside
I don't want to change the way we love right now
Want you to be keepin' up that smile tonight, every night

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm dancin' alone inside my head
Somebody save me
Do you know how I'm thinkin' now?
I'm locked up in love
I'll say the words you always made me
Baby, you know what is goin' down

[Chorus]
Do you know the fight
To keep you by my side?
This love will never change
But I just might go insane
Do you know me now?
So I can see a smile
This love will never grow
But at least you'll never know

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I just wanna keep us close tonight
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I just wanna keep us lovin' like now
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm dancin' alone inside my head
Somebody save me
Do you know how I'm thinkin' now?
I'm locked up in love
I'll say the words you always made me
Baby, you know what is goin' down

[Chorus]
Do you know the fight
To keep you by my side?
This love will never change
But I just might go insane
Do you know me now?
So I can see a smile
This love will never grow
But at least you'll never know

[Outro]
I just wanna keep us close tonight
I just wanna keep us lovin' right now
Oh, babyEmbed
