14 ContributorsYou Are Enough Lyrics[Verse 1]
When we woke up, the world was figured out
Beyond the beauty we've dreamt about
This brilliant light's brighter than we've known
Without our darkness to prove it so
Still, we can't help but to examine it
To add our question marks to periods
At the foot of our bed, we found an envelope

[Chorus]
You're enough, you're enough, you're enough, you are enough
These little words, somehow they're changing us
You're enough, you're enough, you are enough
So we let our shadows fall away like dust

[Verse 2]
When we grew up, our shadows grew up too
But they're just old ghosts that we grew attached to
The tragic flaw is that they hide the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
That you're enough, you're enough, you're enough
I promise you're enough, you're enough, you're enough
I promise you're enough, you're enough, you're enough
I promise you
You might also like[Chorus]
You're enough, you're enough, you're enough, you are enough
These little words, somehow they're changing us
You're enough, you're enough, you are enough
So we let our shadows fall away like dust
You're enough, you're enough, you are enough
These little words, somehow they're changing us
Let it go, let it go, you are enough
So we let our shadows fall away like dust4Embed
