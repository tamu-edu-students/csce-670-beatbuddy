Swim so wild and swim so free
Heaven above and the sea below
See the little white whale on the go

Baby Beluga, oh baby Beluga
Is the water warm, Is your mama home
With you so happy?

Way down yonder where the dolphins play
Where you dive and splash all day
Waves roll in and the waves roll out
See the water squirtin' out of your spout

Baby Beluga, oh, baby Beluga
Sing your little song, sing for all your friends
We'd like to hear you

[Instrumental break]

When it's dark, and you're home and you're fed
Curl up snug in your water bed
Moon is shining and the stars are out
Good night, little whale, goodnight

Baby Beluga, oh, baby Beluga
With tomorrow's sun, another day's begun
You'll soon be waking

Swim so wild and swim so free
Heaven above and the sea below
And a little white whale on the go
You're just a little white whale on the go1Embed
