Look, I'm bettin' you like people
And I'm bettin' you love freak mode
And I'm bettin' you like girls
That give love to girls and stroke your little ego
I bet you I'm guilty, your honor (Honor)
That's just how we live in my genre (Genre)
Who in the hell done paved the road wider?
There's only one Flo and one Rida
I'm a damn shame, order more champagne
Pulling them hamstrings, tryna put it on ya
Bet your lips spin back around, come up
Slow it down, baby, take a little longer

Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go

Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
