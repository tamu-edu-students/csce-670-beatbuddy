19 ContributorsRather Do Lyrics[Verse 1]
I won't pay my taxes, I don't want to
Got a hundred million people that I'd rather lose
And I'll keep my head down low so I don't get too
But I'm always on my phone, so I'm ignorin' you

[Chorus]
I'm pavin' my way, take me away or keepin' me safe
Suck on her face, sorry I'm late, I wish I not came
It's not a race, still think I'm on pace
There's a million, trillion things that I would rather do
Than be here with you

[Verse 2]
I won't tidy up, I'm busy chasin' dreams and wishes
I don't clean my clothes, I never even touch my dishes
I didn't fuck with you but now you're really tryna hit me up
For love, enough, yeah
I'll stay in my bed 'til three in the mornin'
I wish I never woke up from the dream, I was performin'
I sit with the boys, they talk and I'm yawnin'
Thinkin' I'd never come back, but like, good for them
That's why I'm touring

[Chorus]
I'm pavin' my way, take me away or keepin' me safe
Suck on her face, sorry I'm late, I wish I not came
It's not a race, still think I'm on pace
There's a million, trillion things that I would rather do
Than be here with you

Travelled to go see a bitch, yeah
Mia Khalifa my bitch, yeah
She's tryna suck on my dick, yeah
That's why I hit, I don't miss, yeah
People still ask for a pic, yeah
But none of my songs gettin' mixed, yeah
That's why you hatin' on this, yeah
None of you boys gettin' rich, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm pavin' my way, take me away or keepin' me safe
Suck on her face, sorry I'm late, I wish I not came
It's not a race, still think I'm on pace
There's a million, trillion things that I would rather do
Than be here with you4Embed
