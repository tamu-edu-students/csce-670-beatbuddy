4 ContributorsStill Sleepless Lyrics[Intro]
I've been sitting 'round thinkin' 'bout you lately
Having second thoughts about you, baby
And I can't sleep at night (But I can't sleep, I can't sleep alone)
(But I can't sleep, I can't sleep alone)

[Verse 1]
I've been sitting 'round thinkin' 'bout you lately
Having second thoughts about you, baby
And I can't sleep at night (But I can't sleep, I can't sleep alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't sleep at night
No, I can't sleep at night
No, I can't sleep at night
No, I can't sleep at night
I've been sitting 'round thinkin' 'bout you lately
Having second thoughts about you, baby
And I can't sleep at night (But I can't sleep, I can't sleep alone)
No, I can't sleep at night
(But I can't sleep, I can't sleep alone)
(But I can't sleep, I can't sleep alone)
(But I can't sleep, I can't sleep alone)
(But I can't sleep, I can't sleep alone)

[Chorus]
I've been sitting 'round thinkin' 'bout you lately
Having second thoughts about you, baby
And I can't sleep at night (But I can't sleep, I can't sleep alone)
I've been sitting 'round thinkin' 'bout you lately
Having second thoughts about you baby
And I can't sleep at night (But I can't sleep, I can't sleep alone)
