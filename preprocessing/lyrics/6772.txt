21 ContributorsA Million Dreams (Reprise) Lyrics[Chorus: Austyn Johnson, Austyn Johnson & Cameron Seely, Hugh Jackman]
Every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keepin' me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna makeYou might also like4Embed
