In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now I find

[Chorus: Tarja Turunen]
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind

[Verse 2: Marco Hietala]
Sing once again with me, our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind

[Chorus: Marco Hietala]
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind

[Verse 3: Tarja Turunen, Marco Hietala, Both]
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
Your/My spirit and your/my voice
In one combined
You might also like[Chorus: Tarja Turunen, Marco Hietala, Both]
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my/your mind

[Bridge: Tarja Turunen]
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Beware, the Phantom of the Opera

[Verse 4: Tarja Turunen, Marco Hietala, Both]
In all your fantasies, you always knew
That man and mystery, were both in you
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind

[Chorus: Tarja Turunen, Marco Hietala, Both]
The Phantom of the Opera is here/there
Inside my/your mind

[Outro: Tarja Turunen & Marco Hietala]
Sing, my Angel of Music!
He's there the Phantom of the Opera
Sing for me
Sing my angel, sing
Sing for me6Embed
