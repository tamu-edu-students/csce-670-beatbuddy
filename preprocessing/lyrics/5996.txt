20 ContributorsBetter Days Lyrics[Chorus]
Oh, I know that there'll be better days
Oh, that sunshine 'bout to come my way
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days

[Verse 1]
Waking up in California
But these clouds, they won't go away
Every day is like another storm, yeah
I'm just trying not to go insane
Yeah, and the city's shining so bright
So many dark nights, so many dark days
But any time I feel the paranoia
I close my eyes and I pray

[Chorus]
Oh, I know that there'll be better days
Oh, that sunshine 'bout to come my way
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days

[Verse 2]
Been waking up to a new year
Got the past million miles away
I been waking up with a new fear (New fear)
But I know it'll wash away
Whatever you do, don't worry 'bout me
I'm thinking 'bout you, don't worry 'bout us
'Cause in the morning everything can change, yeah
And time will tell you it does
