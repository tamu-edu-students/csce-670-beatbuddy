Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hopin’ I don't repeat history

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday (Ah, ah)
Never need no (No), no one else, babe
’Cause I'll be

[Chorus]
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do
That I won't do, switchin’ for you

[Verse 2]
Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true (You're too good to be true)
But I get tired of runnin', fuck it
Now, I’m runnin' with you (With you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Said, boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday (Ah, ah)
Never need no (No), no onе else, babe
'Causе I'll be

Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do (Nothin')
That I won't do, switchin' for you

Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom

Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
That I won't do, switchin' for you
