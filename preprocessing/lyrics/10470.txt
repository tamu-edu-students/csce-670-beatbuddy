When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
There's a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of the lark

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
For your dreams be tossed and blown

[Chorus]
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
