[Verse 1]
It's all right, there comes a time
Got no patience to search for peace of mind
Layin' low, want to take it slow
No more hidin' or disguisin' truths I've sold

[Chorus]
Every day, it's somethin'
Hits me all so cold
You find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, then I know

[Verse 2]
It's okay, had a bad day
Hands are bruised from breakin' rocks all day
Drained and blue, I bleed for you
You think it's funny, well, you're drownin' in it, too

[Chorus]
Every day, it's somethin'
Hits me all so cold
You find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, then I know

[Verse 3]
Yeah, it's fine, we'll walk down the line
Leave our rain, a cold, trade for warm sunshine
You, my friend, I will defend
And if we change, well, I love you anyway

[Chorus]
Every day, it's somethin'
Hits me all so cold
You find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, then I know21Embed
