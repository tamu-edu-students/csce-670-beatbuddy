27 ContributorsKeep On Loving You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You should have seen by the look in my eyes
That there was somethin' missin'
You should have known by the tone of my voice
But you didn't listen
You play dead, but you never bled
Instead you lie still in the grass all coiled up and hissin'

[Verse 2]
And I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us, baby, way before them
And we're still together

[Pre-Chorus]
And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you

And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you

[Outro]
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you11Embed
