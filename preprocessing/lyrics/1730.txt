Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Verse 1: Cataracs]
Gimme that Moet
Gimme that Cristal
Ladies love my style, at my table gettin wild
Get them bottles poppin', we get that drip and that drop
Now give me two more bottles cuz you know it don't stop

[Pre-Chorus: Cataracs]
Hell yeah, drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
[Chorus: Dev]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

Sippin on, sippin on sizz, I'ma ma-make it fizz
Girl I keep it gangsta, poppin' bottles at the crib
This is how we live, every single night
Take that bottle to the head, and let me see you fly

[Pre-Chorus: Cataracs]
Hell yeah, drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk

Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizard

Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Bridge: The Cataracs]
It's that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up
(You can't touch this)
It's that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up

Hell yeah, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo put yo hands up
Hell yeah, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo put yo hands up
