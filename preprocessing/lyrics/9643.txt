7 ContributorsSuspicious Minds (Film Edit) LyricsWe're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see what you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (Suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

So if an old friend I know stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again asking where I’ve been

You can't see the tears are real I'm cryin'
Yes I'm cryin'
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds with suspicious minds

And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
Oh let our love survive
Oh no

I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
Oh no
When honey you know I've never lied to you
You might also likeOh
Yeah
We're caught in a trap I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see what you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I say
Well don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out

Because I love you too much
Caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much

Caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much
Caught in a trap

I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know caught in a trap
I can’t walk out

Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much
Caught in a trap

I can't walk out
Because I love you too much
Caught in a trap
I can't walk out

Because I love you too much
Caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Well don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know caught in a trap

I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well don't you know caught in a trap
I can't walk

Because I love you too much
Caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well don't you know caught in a trap
I can't walk
Because I love too much babyEmbed
