20 ContributorsBlack Butterflies and Déjà Vu Lyrics[Verse 1]
What would you say if you could say
Everything you needed to
To the one, you needed to?
You flash like a setting sun
You come around, I come undone
Can't find the sound under my tongue
When I look at you

[Chorus]
I lose my voice when I look at you
Can't make a noise though I'm trying to
Tell you all the right words
Waiting on the right words
Just another lovesick afternoon
Black butterflies and déjà vu
Hoping for the right words
Waiting for the right words

[Verse 2]
Just yesterday north of LA
I couldn't help but think of you
Every time I think of you
You crash like a rolling wave
You come around I lose my brain
Can't find the sound under my tongue
When I look at you
See The Maine LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like[Chorus]
I lose my voice when I look at you
Can't make a noise though I'm trying to
Tell you all the right words
Waiting on the right words
Just another lovesick afternoon
Black butterflies and déjà vu
Hoping for the right words
Waiting for the right words

(And you, and you, and you)

[Bridge]
I've been searching for the right words
Right words, but I
I can't even find an echo
Don't you let go
There are only twenty
Six letters I can use
Just to tell you I won't let go
Don't you let go

[Chorus]
I lose my voice when I look at you
Can't make a noise though I'm trying to
Tell you all the right words
Waiting on the right words
Just another lovesick afternoon
Black butterflies and déjà vu
Hoping for the right words
Waiting for the right words
[Chorus]
I lose my voice when I look at you
Can't make a noise though I'm trying to
Tell you all the right words
Waiting on the right words
(I've been searching for the right words
Right words, but I
I can't even find an echo
Don't you let go)

[Outro]
Just another lovesick afternoon
Black butterflies and déjà vu
Hoping for the right words
Waiting for the right words12Embed
