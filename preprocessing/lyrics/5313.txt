33 ContributorsMajor Tom (Coming Home) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Standing there alone, the ship is waiting
All systems are go, "Are you sure?"
Control is not convinced, but the computer
Has the evidence, no need to abort
The countdown starts
Watching in a trance, the crew is certain
Nothing left to chance, all is working
Trying to relax up in the capsule
"Send me up a drink," jokes Major Tom
The count goes on

[Pre-Chorus]
Four, three, two, one

[Chorus]
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating weightless, calling, calling home

[Verse 2]
Second stage is cut, we're now in orbit
Stabilizers up, running perfect
Starting to collect requested data
"What will it affect when all is done?"
Thinks Major Tom
Back at Ground Control, there is a problem
"Go to rockets full," not responding
"Hello, Major Tom, are you receiving?
Turn the thrusters on, we're standing by"
There's no reply

Four, three, two, one

[Chorus]
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating weightless, calling, calling home

[Verse 3]
Across the stratosphere, a final message
"Give my wife my love," then nothing more
Far beneath the ship the world is mourning
They don't realize he's alive
No one understands, but Major Tom sees
"Now the light commands, this is my home
I'm coming home"

[Chorus]
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating weightless, coming home
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating weightless, coming home
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating weightless, coming, coming home

[Outro]
