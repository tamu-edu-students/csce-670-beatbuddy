5 ContributorsSparrows Lyrics[Verse 1]
The sparrow's not worried ‘bout tomorrow
Or the troubles to come
The lily’s not thinking ‘bout the seasons
The drought or the flood
A tree that's planted by the water
Isn't fazed by the fire
So why should I be?

[Chorus]
’Cause You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
And You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
Yeah, You take good care of me

[Verse 2]
The sun's not worried ‘bout the winter
‘Cause soon it will pass
The light's not thinking ‘bout the darkness
Or the shadow it casts
A heart that's planted in forgiveness
Doesn't dwell in the past
So why should I be?
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
And You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
Yeah, You take good care of me

[Bridge]
I know there must be more
But I can’t get past Your kindness
I know there’s got to be more
But I can't get past Your goodness
I know there must be more
But I can’t get past Your kindness
I know there's got to be more
But I can't get past Your goodness

[Chorus]
You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
Oh, You take good care of meEmbed
