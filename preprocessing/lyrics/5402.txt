Runnin' up that hill, you pushin' me back
Wish that I can make you want it bad
I don't need it though
(I don't need it though)

[Verse 1: Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]
Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? 'Cause I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like so alive
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
For me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It is the way, it is the way it really seems
There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one
Some passin' on and out
(And out, and out, yeah)

It wasn't somethin' that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
It wasn't somethin' that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt
I just really wanna talk to you again
That's how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end
It wasn't somthin' 'til you brought it up
I knew that you were tryna make it out
Without a single scar, clawin' at my heart
I saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start
Bring me down, it's not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
I remember you were climbin' on top of me
Why you actin' like you fuckin' forgot me?
I've been dreamin' about a place out in Hollywood
Tell my mama that I'm movin' to Hollywood

[Outro: Lil Peep]
Bring me down, it's not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
Bring me down, it's not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
It wasn't somethin' that I thought about
But, knew that you were absolute in doubt
I just really wanna talk to you again
That's how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end72Embed
