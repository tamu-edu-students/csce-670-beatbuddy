5 ContributorsICE COLD Lyrics[Intro]
Bro, is that [?] on the phone?
Bro, [?] shit
Ice cold
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Ice cold, ice cold
Nigga neck froze
I don't know, I don't know
Where the fuck to go
I been lost in the fucking grave, in the snow
I want my name engraved on a booty pole
Ice cold, ice cold
Nigga neck froze
I don't know, I don't know
Where the fuck to go
I been lost in the fucking grave, in the snow
I want my name engraved on a booty pole (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse]
VVS diamonds on me and they keep me blessed
I can't love no fucking hoe 'cause I can't take the stress
I know my momma love me, she don't like the way I dress
All black ripped skinnies with a turtle neck
I been on, I been on
What the fuck you on?
If you my fucking brother, I can't do you wrong
Come on, let's go to the stu' and go and make a song
I want the bag bad bitch 'til my life is gone
I got a plane, let's go fly away
Pack me boof, to give me finer days
Only smoke, on the brightest haze
Ice cold, ice cold, all my diamonds, hey
You might also like[Bridge]
Bro, I love you so much Letoa
You the shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Ice cold, ice cold
Nigga neck froze
I don't know, I don't know
Where the fuck to go
I been lost in the fucking grave, in the snow
I want my name engraved on a booty pole
Ice cold, ice cold
Nigga neck froze
I don't know, I don't know
Where the fuck to go
I been lost in the fucking grave, in the snow
I want my name engraved on a booty pole (Yeah, yeah)3Embed
