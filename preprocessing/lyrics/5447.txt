40 ContributorsONE PUNCH Lyrics[Intro]
Right here, duck down, stay low, uh
My job, one punch, K.O
Tell her, "Ain't no way I'm runnin' now"
Hard to catch me fumblin'
Jet black heart, beneath that sundress
Sold out tour, pit stop in London Town
Ain't no way I'm runnin' now
Ain't no way I'm runnin'—, yeah

[Chorus]
Right here, duck down, stay low, uh
My job, one punch, K.O
Tell her, "Ain't no way I'm runnin' now"
Ain't no way I'm runnin'—

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna ever leave
Never ride in a limousine before
Your whole casa empty
You took a shot for the magazines, yeah
Another shot, John Kennedy
Why you so upset? I ain't never let 'em touch you
Goddess in the flesh, no BS yellin' "What's new?"
Shawty, don't wanna party
Meet me at the bottom
Buckle in, break my hand
Hangin' too tight (Wouldn't ever leave)
Like a fruit fly (Gimme somethin' sweet)
You can try and hide me
Whatever you're working on
I need you to stay right
You might also like[Chorus]
Right here, duck down, stay low, uh
My job, one punch, K.O
Tell her, "Ain't no way I'm runnin' now"
Ain't no way I'm runnin'—
Right here, duck down, stay low, uh (Right)
My job, one punch, K.O. (Job, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tell her, "Ain't no way I'm runnin' now"
Ain't no way I'm runnin'—

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna ever leave
Never ride in a limousine
Before the whole bottle's empty
You playin' possum, envious
When the lights out, let's begin
Two hundred miles, so empty, baby
Fuck me right like besties, yeah
Do we even need a reason, baby?

[Chorus]
Right here, duck down, stay low, uh
My job, one punch, K.O
Tell her, "Ain't no way I'm runnin' now"
Ain't no way I'm runnin' now5Embed
