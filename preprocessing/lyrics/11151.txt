Well if you’re looking for me in a reggae party me there inna di corner
With a drink inna me left hand and me right hand have a spliff of marijuana
And when the baseline drop inna de riddim me have fi wine up on a daughta
Me just a wine to the riddim and later you know what’s coming after
I’ll tell you wha
I don’t know bout you but
I can only live my life one way
All I want to do everyday is
I just wanna smoke drink and love my girl to some reggae
I call her on the phone, tell her I’m coming home so get ready
I got some weed and a bottle of booze
All I wanna do is
Smoke drink and love my girl to some reggae
It’s been a long day me just take 3 connections from California
And when me reach me reach and touch down you know it hot like a sauna
And the taxi driver want chat off my ear like me no know whagwan ya
So when me reach me yard all my girl can say is what take so long ya
I’ll tell you wha
I don’t know bout you but
I can only live my life one way
All I want to do everyday is
I just wanna smoke drink and love my girl to some reggae
I call her on the phone, tell her I’m coming home so get ready
I got some weed and a bottle of booze
All I wanna do is
Smoke drink and **** my girl to some reggae
I’ll tell you wha
I don’t know bout you but
I can only live my life one way
All I want to do everyday is
I just wanna smoke drink and love my girl to some reggae
I call her on the phone, tell her I’m coming home so get ready
I got some weed and a bottle of booze
All I wanna do is
Smoke drink and love my girl to some reggaeSee Collie Buddz LiveGet tickets as low as $37You might also like3Embed
