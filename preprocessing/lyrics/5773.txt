3 ContributorsSo Lyrics[Verse 1]
It’s so classic
One to one
We keep up the fight but never get enough
I don’t tell you
How it feels
I just walk away assuming time will heal

[Chorus]
Baby, oh
I just wanna make sense of it all
I can’t take the silence when you’re gone
I’d fall right back to you
All you’d have to do is just say so
Say so

[Verse 2]
Picking battles
Keeping score
I tried all the things I never would before
I know well that
Time won’t bend
Watch it fade away as anger settles in

[Chorus]
Baby, oh
I just wanna make sense of it all
I can’t take the silence when you’re gone
I’d fall right back to you
All you’d have to do is just say so
Say so

I know that I let you down
We could never turn back now
I don’t wanna go
Changing on my own
I know that I let you down
You could never love me now
Baby, don’t you go
Changing on your own

[Outro]
Baby, ohEmbed
