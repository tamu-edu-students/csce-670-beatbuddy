I admit it, what's to say? (Yeah)
I'll relive it, without pain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hm, back-street lover on the side of the road
I gotta bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes, I play

[Chorus]
Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, try and mimic, what's insane
I am in it, where do I stand?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hm, Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a back street lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet, I pray

[Chorus]
Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah

[Interlude]
You think I got my eyes closed
But I've been looking at you the whole fuckin' time

[Chorus]
Once upon a time I could control myself, yeah
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah

[Outro]
Once upon a time I could love myself, yeah
Once upon a time I could love you, yeah, yeah
Once! Once! Once! Once! Yeah
Once! Once! Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh once!10Embed
