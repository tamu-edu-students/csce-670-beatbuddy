Something isn't right, I feel it in my bones
Every time I look around, it follows me home
I think I'm paranoid

[Verse 1: Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
Something isn't right, I feel it in my bones
Every time I look around, it follows me home
And I get so stressed out with nobody here to listen
When my head gets loud from the weight of this vision

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe & Brian Burkheiser]
All this emptiness inside, I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die, wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head? I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head? I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
Is it all in my head? I can't escape the noise
Is it all in my head? I think I'm paranoid
Take me to the edge like hands around my neck
Hanging by a thread again, I think I'm paranoid

[Verse 2: Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
Something isn't right, think they start to notice
Hear it in the night, in and out of focus
And I get so stressed out with nobody here to listen
Got a head full of doubt from the weight of this vision

All this emptiness inside, I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die, wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head? I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head? I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
Is it all in my head? I can't escape the noise
Is it all in my head? I think I'm paranoid
Take me to the edge like hands around my neck
Hanging by a thread again, I think I'm paranoid

[Outro: Eric Vanlerberghe & Brian Burkheiser]
All this emptiness inside, I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die, wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head? I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head? I think I'm paranoid4Embed
