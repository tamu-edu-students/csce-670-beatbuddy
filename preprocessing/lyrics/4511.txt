Couldn't say I cared because I would just lie
So sick of my phone I wish that it would die
Do not disturb because I know it won't matter
You won't hit my phone up ever after

[Refrain]
No needed to talk or to see me
It's like I can read your mind or something like that
And when the rain falls yeah I'll just sit in my room
It's so comfortable just laying on my floor

[Chorus]
Pouring outside, and I've got no place to be
The rain is too dangerous, and you can stay here with me
And I know that it's late out, we both know you can't leave
With you I'm just spaced out, the way you tugged on my sleeve

[Refrain]
No needed to talk or to see me
It's like I can read your mind or something like that
And when the rain falls yeah I'll just sit in my room
It's so comfortable just laying on my floor

[Bridge]
Couldn't say I cared because I would just lie
So sick of my phone I wish that it would die
Do not disturb because I know it won't matter
You won't hit my phone up ever after
