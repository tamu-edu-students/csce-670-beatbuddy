Tell me that you know you feel it every single time
I'll show that you're the only thing that stays on my mind
Tell me that you'll hold me and I'll never leave your side
I'm sure that there ain't no reason for words to define

[Chorus]
Our love, our l-o-ve
Can´t define our love, our l-o-ve
Can´t define our love, our l-o-ve
Can´t define our love, our l-o-ve

Tell me that you know you feel it every single time
I'll show that you're the only thing that stays on my mind
Tell me that you'll hold me and I'll never leave your side
