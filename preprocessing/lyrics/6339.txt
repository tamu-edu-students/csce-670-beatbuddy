34 ContributorsThe Hardest Button to Button Lyrics[Verse 1]
We started living in an old house
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out
It was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun, and it was 1981

[Verse 2]
We named him 'Baby', he had a toothache
He started crying, it sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long, because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it

[Verse 3]
Now we're a family, and we're alright now
We got money, and a little place to fight now
We don't know you, and we don't owe you
But if you see us around, I got something else to show you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Now it's easy when you don't know better
You think it's sleazy? Then put it in a short letter
We keep warm, but there's just something wrong with you
Just feel that you're the hardest little button to button
You might also like[Verse 5]
I had opinions that didn't matter
I had a brain that felt like pancake batter
I got a backyard with nothing in it
Except a stick, a dog, and a box with something in it

[Chorus]
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button, oh-oh
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button, oh-oh
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button, oh-oh7Embed
