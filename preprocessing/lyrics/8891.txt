3 ContributorsLonely Lyrics[Verse: MAJAN]
Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely
And I feel so spaced out, running into no one
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely, lonely

[Pre-Chorus: MAJAN]
All of my friends went home
Now that they're gone, I feel alone
So days end, run into tomorrow
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely

[Chorus: MAJAN]
Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely
And I feel so spaced out, running into no one
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely, lonely
All of my friends went home
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely, lonely
All of my friends went home
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely

[Verse: MAJAN]
Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely
And I feel so spaced out, running into no one
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely, lonely
Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely
And I feel so, days end, run into tomorrow
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely

All of my friends went home
Now that they're gone, I feel alone
And all of my friends went home too soon
And so did you, and so did you

[Chorus: MAJAN]
Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely
And I feel so spaced out, running into no one
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so—
Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely
And I feel so spaced out, running into no one
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely, lonely
All of my friends went home
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely, lonely
All of my friends went home
And I feel so lonely, and I feel so lonely1Embed
