3 ContributorsThe Seeker (Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I looked under chairs
I looked under tables
I'm tryin to find the key
To fifty million fables

[Chorus]
They call me the seeker
I been searchin low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

[Verse 2]
I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked The Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me either

[Chorus]
They call me the seeker
I been searchin low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
'Till the day I die

[Bridge 1]
People tend to hate me
Because I never smile
As I ransack their homes
They want to shake my hand
You might also likeFocusing on nowhere
Investigating miles
I'm a seeker
I'm a really desperate man

[Guitar/Piano solo]

[Chorus 2]
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

[Bridge 2]
I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah but look at my face ain't this a smile

I'm happy when life's good and when it's bad I cry
I got values but I don't know how or why

[Verse 3]
I'm looking for me
You're looking for you
We're looking at each other
And we don't know what to do

[Chorus]
They call me the seeker
I been searchin low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die1Embed
