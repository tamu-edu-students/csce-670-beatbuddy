Ah ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya

Hey, little darlin'
Oh, little darlin'
Oh ho where are you
My lover, I was wrong-ah
To try to love you
Ah ooh ah ooh ah ohh ah

No way-ah
That my love-ah
Was just for you
For only you

[Spoken by Bill Reed]:
My darlin', I need you
To call my own and never do wrong
To hold in mine your little hand
I'll know too soon that all is so grand
Please hold my hand

[Sung by Dave Somerville]:
My dear-ah, I was wrong-ah
To try to love you
Ah ooh ah ooh ah ohh ah
You might also likeNo way-ah
That my love-ah
Was just for you
For only youEmbed
