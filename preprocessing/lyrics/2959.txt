6 ContributorsPeter Pan Lyrics[Intro: Ruth B.]
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even, sometimes, he would go away too

[Chorus: Prinz]
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook (Look)

[Verse 1: Prinz]
Chasing money, have to get that bag (That bag)
I've been checking my phone connection
Shaky, man I got that lag (Man, I do)
Been preein' the Insta' previews
It's funny, man, that shit so bad (Haha)
Just chill man and be yourself
You ain't that guy, you ain't that lad (You ain’t)
Seventeen and I havе that dream
I'mma chase my goals and I'll make it happеn
You said you don’t believe in me
It's cool, it's calm, I know you cappin’ (It's cap)
Home alone, tryna make this bread
Legally, I don't need no trappin' (No trappin’)
Ninety-nine plus in the notice, huh?
I don't even know what's happening (Look)

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook (Yo, it’s Liilz)

[Verse 2: Liilz]
I feel so alone, man, I feel so lost (So lost)
Don't know who I am or who I can trust (Who can I?)
Speak on my name, then I move like dust
Focus on myself 'cause you know it’s a must (Ah-ha)
Telling me I can’t do this or that
Did my own ting, now look where I’m at
No break, fuck a Kit Kat, let it spin back
Refresh the moment like a Tic Tac (Brrr)
Just coming straight flows on shows
When I'm overseas the funds just grows (Yes)
I'm a good yute, but I can switch up
You don’t wanna see me juxtapose (Switch up)
Going to school, they laughed at my clothes
Look at me now, got a bag on my toes, I made it
I suppose that we shutting shit down
Case closed (Yeah-yeah)

[Chorus: Prinz]
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
[Outro: Ruth B.]
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even, sometimes, he would go away tooEmbed
