31 ContributorsHypnotic Lyrics[Intro]
Ah
Ah

[Verse 1]
I wanna be on the front line, knotted-up suit ties
Talkin' like a headstrong mama
Got a picture in your wallet, makin' me a habit
Wearin' your vintage T-shirt
Tied ribbons on your top hat, tellin' me I'm all that
Just like the girls from your hometown
Sweet-blooded and I'm stranded, see if I can stand it
Drinkin' in the shallow water

[Pre-Chorus]
Magnetic everything about you
You really got me now

[Chorus]
You do it to me so well
Hypnotic takin' over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talkin' in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean, dug so deep
Hypnotic takin' over me
Ah
Ah
You might also like[Verse 2]
White threads on my laces, stuck on the hinges
Swingin' the door to the backyard
Cut splinters, walk a tightrope, spun like a bandage
Touch on the outer surface
Bright eyes of the solstice, wherever your mind is
Headed for a freight train city
Locked up 'til you're moonlit, brushin' my hair back
Feelin' your lips on my cold neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Magnetic everything about you
You really got me now

[Chorus]
You do it to me so well
Hypnotic takin' over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talkin' in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean, dug so deep
Hypnotic takin' over me

[Bridge]
Ah
Hypnotic takin' over me
[Chorus]
You do it to me so well
Hypnotic takin' over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talkin' in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean, dug so deep
Hypnotic takin' over me

[Outro]
Ah
Hypnotic takin' over me
Ah
Hypnotic takin' over me
Ah
