26 ContributorsBeach Baby Lyrics[Verse]
When you're out, tell your lucky one
To know that you'll leave
Don't you lock when you're fleeing
I'd like not to hear keys
Only hold till your coffee warms
But don't hurry and speed
Once a time, put a tongue
In your ear on the beach
And you clutched clicking heels
