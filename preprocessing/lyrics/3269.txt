Well, we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin' all that noise
'Cause they found new toys
Well, we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya
That's a drag

[Chorus]
School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

[Post-Chorus]
No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, we got no class
And we got no principles
And we got no innocence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever
My school's been blown to pieces

[Post-Chorus]
No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Out for summer
Out 'til fall
We might not come back at all

[Outro]
School's out forever
School's out for summer
School's out with fever
School's out completely8Embed
