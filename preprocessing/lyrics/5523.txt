3 ContributorsStill Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since we last spoke
I still wonder what you’re up to
After all that shit we've been through

And I've been spending a lot of time drinking and smoking
Hopin’ to subdue
The thought of you in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're out there somewhere
And if you still even care
Possibly still questionin', "what is he doin'"

[Chorus]
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain
Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore
And there's probably people telling you that I’m doing fine
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I’m strong
It still hurts

[Verse 2]
There's been a lot of nights when I feel alone
Needed someone to talk to
’cause I just need to get through
See Jeff Bernat LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also likeAnd I've been spending a lot of money on things that I don't need
Hoping that I'll feel new
But I can’t get you out my head

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're out there somewhere
And if you still even care
Possibly still questionin', "what is he doin'"

[Chorus]
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain
Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore
And there's probably people telling you that I'm doing fine
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong

[Outro]
I've been tryna find a way (girl, I've been trying to find a way) to numb all this pain
(a way that I can numb this pain) Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore (I don't wanna feel)
And there's probably people telling you that I'm doing fine (I'm just trying to get you outta my head)
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong

It still hurtsEmbed
