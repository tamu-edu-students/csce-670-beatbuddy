Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment, but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
Of course it's fancy dress
And they're all looking quite full on in bunny ears and devil horns and how

[Verse 2]
Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment, but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
I wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
And put it all back in
You've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

[Chorus]
And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that you've drank a lot

And you should bear that in mind tonight, bear that in mind
Yeah, you should bear that in mind tonight, bear that in mind
And you can pour your heart out but her reasonin' will block
Owt you send her after nine o' clock
[Verse 3]
Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment, but
Tonight there'll be some love, oh
Tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before

[Chorus]
And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that you've drank a lot

[Post-Chorus 2]
And you should bear that in mind tonight, bear that in mind
Yeah, you should bear that in mind tonight, bear that in
And you can pour your heart out around three o' clock
When the two-for-one's undone the writer's block23Embed
