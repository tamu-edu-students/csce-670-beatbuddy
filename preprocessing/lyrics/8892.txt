When the world goes to bed
I'll lie here empty in my head but I'm fine
I'm fine
And if the world crash and burns
Will you still love me through the night
I'll feel alright
I'm feeling alright now

[Chorus]
'Cause you are my shooting star
You made me fall from the star
And healed my broken heart
Be my light through the dark
But I don't mind
Waiting up for your love
Yeah, I don't mind
Just, please don't give it up

[Verse 2]
'Cause when the world goes to bed
I'll think of us and where we stand
Stay up all night inside the thoughts of all our plans
And if the world crash and burns
Will you stay truе to your word
And take my hand let's get lost in еach other's hearts
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause you are my shooting star
You made me fall from the star
And healed my broken heart
Be my light through the dark
But I don't mind
Waiting up for your love
Yeah, I don't mind
Just, please don't give it up1Embed
