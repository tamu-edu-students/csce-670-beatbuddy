8 ContributorsSun Will Shine Lyrics[Verse 1]
It feels like we're fallin' apart
Just a little unstable
We're both half asleep at the wheel
Yeah, we're strugglin' to save us
So we both get drunk and talk all night
Pour out our hearts, try to make it right
It's no fairy tale, no lullaby
But we get by-y-y, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun will shine tomorrow
It will be alright
And I know we're far from perfect
But at least we try
Through every battle, every all-time low
You always hold my hand and lead us ho-o-ome
I know the sun will shine tomorrow
It will be alright

[Drop]
Yeah, it will be alright
It will bе alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
It will bе alright

I'm lyin' awake every night
Wonderin' if we will make it
It's hard to be strong when you're weak
And you're hidin' your failures
So we both get drunk and talk all night
Pour out our hearts, try to make it right
It's no fairy tale, no lullaby
But we get by-y-y, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun will shine tomorrow
It will be alright
And I know we're far from perfect
But at least we try
Through every battle, every all-time low
You always hold my hand and lead us home
I know the sun will shine tomorrow
It will be alright

[Drop]
Yeah, it will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright (The sun will shine tomorrow)
It will be alright (The sun will shine tomorrow)
[Outro]
Yeah, it will be alright
It will be alrightEmbed
