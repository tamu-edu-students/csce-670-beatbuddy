17 ContributorsTwo Years Clear Lyrics[Intro: Idi Akz, Shiloh Dynasty & Producer Tag]
Tell me
Why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, I wouldn't like that (Jak made this one)
Bro, I can't lie to you right now, you need to focus, you're tough with the rappin' ting
You're hard at football, but distractions now are a blessing in the future
You get me, you've just gotta balance your time
Look, akh, it's pain, hear me out, like bro

[Verse 1]
I don't even think she likes me, wanna use me to get over her exes
And my heart's still broken, bro, ask me why did I air her messagе
Used to be friends, now, I don't likе her, them man are some well known phonies
Can't talk about love, it's more than a myth, my hearts still frozen there's holes, G, look
I can't express my feelings if I like you then I might compress it
And I wish that I stayed at home cuz if I see love then I might just dead it
I see love as an endless game, in this endless cycle pains the gain
I know love has made me change, like why do love stories end the same

[Chorus]
We could've gone two years clear in love
But love ain't a simple thing
She's got me for the time that I live
But sorry darling I could never even wife this ting
Reasons why I'm anti love
I'm anti love bro don't take the mick
Like Jaggar if you know what it is
My brodie came through with a gorgeous ting
We could've gone two years clear in love
But love ain't a simple thing
She's got me for the time that I live
But sorry darling I could never even wife this ting
Reasons why I'm anti love
I'm anti love bro don't take the mick
Like Jaggar if you know what it is
My brodie came through with a gorgeous ting
You might also like[Verse 2]
Like
I don't think she wants me
If she ain't made that clear already
And she thinks she can lead me on
Like me I can't fall for love you get me
Feel pain that I can't express
I'm always mislead so easily
Tell lies to sweeten me
She's got no respect or decency
And my mental state is messed
Can't be a Petrarchan lover
I see love as a fucking myth
After you can't love no other
I'm so hurt by my past relations
Many reasons why I'm anti love
I put pain into bars and flows
I'm only 15 don't know that stuff

[Chorus]
We could've gone two years clear in love
But love ain't a simple thing
She's got me for the time that I live
But sorry darling I could never even wife this ting
Reasons why I'm anti love
I'm anti love bro don't take the mick
Like Jaggar if you know what it is
My brodie came through with a gorgeous ting
We could've gone two years clear in love
But love ain't a simple thing
She's got me for the time that I live
But sorry darling I could never even wife this ting
Reasons why I'm anti love
I'm anti love bro don't take the mick
Like Jaggar if you know what it is
My brodie came through with a gorgeous ting
[Bridge]
I ain't finished yet
Like tell my bro I ain't finished yet
Look
Hear me out
Let me talk about feelings though (Stick to the rap)
Like
Hear me out

[Verse 3]
See the way that you make me feel
Nobody makes me feel this way
I thought love was reciprocal
I got trapped in this ting no way
I put faith in God
Bro told me
Stick to the bars and flows you'll pattern
Friendships get turned into feelings
Suppress that thought like no it can't happen

[Chorus]
We could've gone two years clear in love
But love ain't a simple thing
She's got me for the time that I live
But sorry darling I could never even wife this ting
Reasons why I'm anti love
I'm anti love bro don't take the mick
Like Jaggar if you know what it is
My brodie came through with a gorgeous ting
We could've gone two years clear in love
But love ain't a simple thing
She's got me for the time that I live
But sorry darling I could never even wife this ting
Reasons why I'm anti love
I'm anti love bro don't take the mick
Like Jaggar if you know what it is
My brodie came through with a gorgeous ting3Embed
