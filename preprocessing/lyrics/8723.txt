Such is the way of the world
You can never know
Just where to put all your faith
And how will it grow?

[Chorus]
Gonna rise up
Burning black holes in dark memories
Gonna rise up
Turning mistakes into gold

[Verse 2]
Such is the passage of time
Too fast to fold
Suddenly swallowed by signs
Lo and behold

[Chorus]
Gonna rise up
Find my direction magnetically
Gonna rise up
Throw down my ace in the holeYou might also like1Embed
