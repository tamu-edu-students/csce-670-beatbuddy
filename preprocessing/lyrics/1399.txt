My baby, my baby (Ooh-oh)
You're my baby, say it to me (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
Baby, my baby (Ooh, ooh-oh)
Tell your baby that I'm your baby (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh)

[Chorus]
I bet on losing dogs
I know they're losing and I pay for my place by the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I'll be there on their side, I'm losing by their side

[Post-Chorus]
Aah, aah-ah, aah-ah
Aah, aah, aah-ah, aah-ah

[Chorus]
Will you let me, baby, lose on losing dogs?
I know they're losing and I pay for my place by the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I wanna feel it

[Bridge]
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when I'm finally fine
How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I come
Someone to watch me die, someone to watch me die
