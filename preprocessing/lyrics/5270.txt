35 ContributorsHeartbreak Warfare Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lightning strike
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Chorus]
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?

[Verse 2]
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Chorus]
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Just say so

[Bridge]
How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
It's a heart, heartbreak

[Verse 3]
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down
[Chorus]
Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak

[Outro]
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare13Embed
