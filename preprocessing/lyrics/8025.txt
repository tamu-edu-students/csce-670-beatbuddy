4 Contributors​indifferent Lyrics[Verse 1]
Said you tryna be happy
I wish you good luck
I would rather drink liquor
I would rather smoke blunts

Got a pain in my chest
And a heart that sucks
They don't give second chances
Well, I don't give fucks

Trying to give praise
To get to heaven's gates
They don't wanna take advice
From a kid my age

All I'm gonna say
Is "let's get faced"
It's not like anything
Really matter anyway

But I guess it depends
On what's inside your head

I'm in a rut and outta town
Swear my whole world's upside down
There ain't much I'd do instead
Guess I'm indifferent
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
My whole life
I looked for light
Let the whole world in my heart
Far as I know
We don't know where to go
Where to go when it gets dark

When it gets freezin' and bleak
We don't even know where to start
Far as I know
We don't know where to go
Where to go when it gets dark
So we sing

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
