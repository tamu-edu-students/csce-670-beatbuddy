Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (W-w-wacko)
You'll never shine if you don't glow
[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
(And all that glitters is gold)
Only shootin' stars break the mold
[Verse 2]
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
The water's gettin' warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
(All that glitters is gold)
Only shootin' stars break the mold
[Interlude]
Go for the moon (W-w-wacko, w-w-wacko)
Go for the moon (W-w-wacko, w-w-wacko)
Go for the moon
Go for the moon

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
(And all that glitters is gold)
Only shooting stars…

[Bridge]
Somebody once asked, "Could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place"
I said, "Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself and we could all use a little change"
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
(And all that glitters is gold)
Only shootin' stars break the mold

[Outro]
(And all that glitters is gold)
