Deep love is a burning fire
Stay, 'cause then the flames grows higher
Babe, don't let him steal your heart
It's easy, easy
Girl, this game can't last forever
Why we cannot live together?
Try, don't let him take your love from me

[Chorus]
You're no good, can't you see?
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set her free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it, Louie, she is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it, Louie, 'cause I'm her lover

[Verse 2]
Stay, 'cause this boy wants to gamble
Stay, love's more than he can handle, girl
Oh, come on, stay by me forever, ever
Why does he go on pretending
That his love is never ending
Babe, don't let him steal your love from me

You're no good, can't you see?
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set her free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it, Louie, she is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it, Louie, 'cause I'm her lover

[Outro]
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it, Louie, she is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it, Louie, 'cause I'm her lover
Brother Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it, Louie—4Embed
