37 ContributorsEvil Like Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Dove Cameron]
Look at you, look at me, I don’t know who to be, Mother
Is it wrong? Is it right? Be a thief in the night? Mother
Tell me what to do

[Verse 2: Kristin Chenoweth]
I was once like you, my child, slightly insecure
Argued with my mother, too, thought I was mature
But I put my heart aside
And I used my head
Now I think it's time you learned
What dear old mamma said

[Chorus 1: Kristin Chenoweth]
Don’t you wanna be evil like me? Don’t you wanna be mean?
Don't you wanna make mischief your daily routine?
Well you can spend your life attending to the poor
But when you're evil doing less is doing more
Don't you wanna be ruthless and rotten and mad?
Don't you wanna be very, very good at being bad?

[Bridge: Kristin Chenoweth]
I have tried my whole life long
To do the worst I can
Clawed my way to victory
Built my master plan
Now the time has come, my dear
For you to take your place
Promise me you’ll try to be
An absolute disgrace
You might also like[Chorus 2: Kristin Chenoweth]
Don't you wanna be evil like me?
Don't you wanna be cruel?
Don't you wanna be nasty and brutal and cool?

[Verse 3: Kristin Chenoweth]
And when you grab that wand that's when your reign begins
Who wants an evil queen without a sack of sins?

[Chorus 3: Kristin Chenoweth]
Don't you wanna be heartless and hardened as stone?
Don't you wanna be finger licking' evil to the bone?

[Verse 4: Kristin Chenoweth]
This is not for us to ponder
This was preordained
You and I shall rule together
Freedom soon regain
Mistress of the universe, powerful and strong
Daughter, hear me
Help me, join me
Won't you sing along?

[Outro: Both, Dove Cameron & Kristin Chenoweth]
Now we're gonna be evil!
It's true!
Never gonna think twice
And we're gonna be spiteful
Yes, spiteful!
That's nice
In just an hour or two
Our future's safe and sure
This mother-daughter act is going out on tour
If you wanna be evil and awful and free
Then you should thank your lucky star
That you were born the girl you are
The daughter of an evilicious queen
Like me!8Embed
