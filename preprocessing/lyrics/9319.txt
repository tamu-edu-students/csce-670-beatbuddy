11 ContributorsThe Devil Glitch Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes you can fix something by just being a prick
Winning by intimidation

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you can fix something by just lifting your skirt
It's the ultimate distraction

[Verse 3]
I poke button
I want action
Let's hear some gears and see some smoke
No dilly-dally
Move your heinie
This is the age of "go for broke"

[Screw It, There Are 500 Verses, I Don't Have Time For This]
Sometimes you can fix something by just kissing some ass
If you don't mind humiliation
Sometimes you can fix something by just smoking a pipe
Academic contemplation

No steady eye, no magic touch
