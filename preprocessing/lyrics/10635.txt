Well, come on let's go
Let's go, let's go, little darlin'
And tell me that you'll never leave me
Come on, come on, let's go, ah
Again, again and again

[Verse 2]
Well, now
Swing me, swing me
All the way down there
Come on let's go, little darlin'
Let's go, let's go again once more

[Bridge]
Well
I love you so, dear
And I'll never let you go
Come on, baby, so
Oh pretty baby, I-I love you so

[Verse 3]
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Little sweetheart
Then we can always be together
Come on, come on
Let's go again

And I'll never let you go
Come on, baby, so
Oh pretty baby, I-I love you so

Let's go, let's go, let's go
Little darlin'
They're dancin', and we belong here
Come on, come on, let's go, ah
Again, again and again and again

Again, again and again and again
Again, again and again and again
Again, again and again and again
Again, again and again and again2Embed
