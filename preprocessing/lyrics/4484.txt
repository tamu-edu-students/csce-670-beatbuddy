She'll paint a cabinet from the 60's
And find diamonds when she's thrifting
Oh, what's it like?
To be the muse of every true romantic
West of the Atlantic

Hey little darling, run like the weekend
I get lost and found in your arms
Rooftop view, we met on a Wednesday

Now which do you prefer?
To be alone, to be in love?
Or to just be worth it?
I think you're worth it

Meet me under the movie screen
I'll kiss your face in the dark
Don't really care if it's too soon to say
But I like the way you pull me apart

Hey, do ya like the Velvet Underground?
'Cause you got the style it takes and I like hanging around
'Nother Sunday morning
Yeah, I've got a feeling and it feels like falling
(Hey little darling, run like the weekend)
Do ya feel like falling?
(I get lost and found in your arms)
You might also likeOh, which do you prefer?
To be alone, or to be in love?
Oh, which one wouldn't hurt?
Would it be worth it?

Taste the strawberry sunscreen
Laughing at songs from the 90s
Don't really care if it rains or it shines, I'm still stuck inside
The treasure chest center of both of your eyes
Kiss with them open, see what it's like to be loved1Embed
