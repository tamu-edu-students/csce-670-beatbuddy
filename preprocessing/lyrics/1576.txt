3 ContributorsChicago Police Torture Summary of Evidence LyricsSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE OF MONELL POLICY AND PRACTICE OF TORTURE AND COVER-UP, AND OF DEFENDANTS MARTIN’S, SHINES’, NEEDHAM’S AND HILLARD’S INVOLVEMENT [REDACTED]

1. Mayor Richard M. Daley was the States’ Attorney of Cook County from 1981 through 1988, and he has served as Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1989 to the present.

2. On or about February 25, 1982, Police Superintendent Richard Brzeczek informed States Attorney Richard M. Daley by letter of the allegations made by Dr. John Raba, that Andrew Wilson had been beaten and electric shocked by Chicago Police detectives at Area 2 on February 14, 1982. 2/25/82 Brzeczek Letter to Daley; Brzeczek Affidavit.

3. Brzeczek further informed Daley that he would not initiate a criminal investigation into the allegations that Wilson was tortured unless Daley authorized such an investigation. Id.

4. Daley never authorized a criminal investigation, and the Chicago Police Department therefore did not initiate a criminal investigation into Wilson’s allegations, and on May 19, 1983, Daley honored Burge and four other Area 2 detectives for their work in the Wilson case” Brzeczek Dep., Wilson v. City of Chicago, pp 123-24; Brzeczek Affidavit; Chicago Tribune, 5/20/83, “Daley Hails 11 in Crime War.”

5. The Chicago Police Department never investigated numerous allegations of police torture and abuse which arose from the manhunt to find and arrest Andrew Wilson and which were lodged with its IAD and OPS in February of 1982. Wilson v. City of Chicago, 6 F3d 1230 (7th Cir. 1993).

6. On November 12, 1982, Andrew Wilson testified at his motion to suppress hearing that he was tortured by Jon Burge, John Yucaitis, and other Area 2 detectives by electric shock, bagging, beating and burning on a radiator. People v. Wilson. 2

7. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of the City of Chicago and Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin, judicially admitted that: At the hearing, Andrew Wilson will testify that on February 14, 1982, he was arrested at an apartment by several officers, including respondents Burge and Yucaitis. As Wilson was being taken to the car to be transported to Area II, he heard Burge telling the transporting officers not to “mess with” Wilson and that they would deal with him when they arrived at the station. Wilson was then taken to Area II by Yucaitis and three other officers. Transcript of Testimony of Andrew Wilson, July 7, 10, 11, 1989, at 2914-31 When they arrived at Area II, Wilson was taken to a room where the four transporting officers, including Yucaitis, and other officers started beating him. They hit him, kicked him, knocked him down and slammed him into a window so hard that it broke. In addition, one of the officers grabbed a plastic garbage bag and put it over Wilson’s head, holding it around his neck so that he could not breathe. The officers took the bag off when Wilson bit a hole in it. The officers stopped beating Wilson when Burge entered the room and stated that if it had been him, he would not have left any marks on Wilson. Tr. at 2932-36 Wilson was taken to a second room and handcuffed to the wall. Yucaitis then took Wilson to a telephone and told him to call his brother. When Wilson replied that he did not want to talk but wanted a lawyer, he was taken back to the second room again handcuffed to the wall. Tr. At 2937-44. Burge entered the room and told Wilson he was going to make a statement because Burge’s reputation was at stake. Burge left the room and Yucaitis came in with a brown paper bag. Yucaitis opened the bag and took out a black box about 12-14 inches long, 8-9 inches wide and 6 ½-7 inches high. The box had a crank and two wires with clamps. Yucaitis squatted down in front of Wilson with the box between his own legs, and put one clamp in Wilson’s nose and one on Wilson’s ears, and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson’s teeth to grind and was so painful that he kicked Yucaitis. Yucaitis punched him in the mouth and cranked the box again. Yucaitis left the room and then returned, put the black box in the bag, and left again. Tr. at 2947-55. Respondent O’Hara then came in and took Wilson to see the Assistant State’s Attorney, Lawrence Hyman. According to Wilson’s testimony, with O’Hara present, Wilson asked Hyman, “You want me to make a statement after they’ve been torturing me?” O’Hara took Wilson back to the second room. Tr. at 2956-59. Burge later returned to the second room with the brown paper bag and said, “Fun time.” Burge put a pair of handcuffs on Wilson’s other arm and another pair on Wilson’s 3 ankles. He then placed the bag in the garbage can and left. He returned, took out the black box, put the clamps on Wilson’s ears and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson’s to grind his teeth and knocked Wilson out of his chair. Wilson kept rubbing the clips from the electrical device off his ears. Tr at 2961-63. Wilson was then handcuffed across the radiator, kneeling with his arms outstretched. Burge and another officer put the clamps on Wilson’s little fingers and cranked the box repeatedly this time for longer periods. As he was being shocked, Wilson’s chest, leg and face were forced against the radiator and he was burned. Tr. at 2963-66 When Burge stopped cranking and took the clamps off Wilson’s little fingers, he took another shocking device out of the bag. It plugged into an electrical outlet and had a cord sticking out of it. Burge placed the device very near Wilson’s skin so that he could feel it tingling. Burge then jabbed the second device into Wilson’s back and Wilson got a full jolt, slamming Wilson into the grill on the window. Wilson began spitting out blood. Burge and the other officer put the devices back in the bag and left. Tr. at 296-68. A while later, Wilson was taken to Area I headquarters for a lineup. At Area I, Burge stuck his gun in Wilson’s mouth and cocked it back and forth. When Wilson arrived back at Area II after the lineup, Burge told him that if he did not make a statement, he would shock him again. Later, Burge told Wilson he was going to “fry his black ass.” Tr. at 2969-75. Memorandum In Opposition, pp.4-6.

In February of 1992, Andrew Wilson testified before the Police Board on behalf of the City in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, and described his torture in a manner consistent with how the City described it in its January 22, 1992 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, at pp. 4-6; Police Board Testimony of Andrew Wilson.

11. Melvin Jones testified that while being held in an interview room and interrogated, Lieutenant Jon Burge pulled up a chair and sat in front of Jones who was cuffed to the wall, that Burge had a little wooden box with a long cord, that Burge pulled down Jones’ pants to his ankles and electrically shocked Jones on his foot, then on his thigh and then on his penis. Jones testified that he kept hollering and telling Burge that he wasn’t supposed to do this to him, that Burge said to him that he had no proof, that Burge asked detective Flood, who was present for the shocking, if he saw anything and Flood looked at the ceiling and said no. Jones further stated that Burge said, “[n]o court and no State are going to take your word against a Lieutenant’s word,” and Burge later hit him in the head with a stapler. People v. Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 65-71, 74.

12. Melvin Jones further testified that on February 6, 1982, while he was still being detained in an Area 2 interview room, Defendant McWeeny entered the room with another detective and questioned Jones, after which Lieutenant Burge entered the room and asked McWeeny if Jones had started talking yet. Jones further stated that when McWeeny said Jones hadn’t said anything yet, Burge pulled out a gun and cocked it, put it up to Jones’ head and said
he was going to “blow Jones’ black head off.” Id. pp. 76-79.
13. Melvin Jones testified on February 19, 1992 on behalf of the City at the Chicago Police Board Hearing, that McWeeny told Burge to get out of the room and McWeeny stated to him later that evening that he [McWeeny] “had got the Lieutenant off me for right now. He said, if you are going to talk, you know, it would be easier for me.” Id. at 79; Chicago Police Board, 2/19/92, p. 856.

14. Cassandra Watson, Melvin Jones’ attorney in 1982, testified at the Chicago Police 5 Board Hearings on 2/19/92 that Jones told her within the first 10 days of February, 1982 that he had been beaten and threatened at Area 2, that while he was in an interview room at Area 2 a gun had been placed to his head, and that Lieutenant Burge had electrically shocked him with an electrical shock box. Chicago Police Board Proceedings, 2/19/92, pp. 960-62.

15. Jones testified on behalf of the City in the Police Board proceedings against Burge, and again identified Burge as the person who tortured him. Id., p. 826).

16. In their Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: Melvin Jones will testify that on February 5, 1982, just nine days prior to Andrew Wilson’s arrest, he was taken to an Area II interrogation room where he was handcuffed and questioned by Area II detectives concerning his knowledge and participation in a murder. When he failed to give information implicating himself in the murder, respondent Burge entered the room and told Jones that he was going to talk. Burge then asked Jones if he had ever heard of him, and when Jones replied that he had not, Burge told him that before he left the station Jones would “wish he had never set eyes on him.” Burge left the interrogation room but returned after Jones persisted in his refusal to talk to the interrogating detectives. Burge had Jones cuffed to a second ring and then produced and plugged into the wall socket a wooden box measuring approximately 10" x 6" x 6", with tweezers and a long nail type device. He again asked Jones if he was going to talk. When Jones again refused, Burge pulled down Jones’ pants and shorts and, using
the electrical device, shocked Jones three times, on the foot, thigh, and penis. While he was shocking Jones, Burge demanded that Jones talk. He told Jones that he had also shocked “Satan” (Anthony Holmes) and “Cochise,” forcing them to crawl all over the floor. He also told Jones that nobody would believe his word against a lieutenant’s. Burge asked another Area II detective present in the room if he had seen anything, and the detective looked at the ceiling and said no. Burge also tied a sock in Jones’ mouth. Burge was interrupted in his interrogation of Jones, apparently by the news that a policeman had been shot and killed on a bus in his area. Later, Burge also struck Jones with a stapler. When Jones continued to deny knowing anything about the murder, Burge again entered the interrogation room. He pointed a gun at Jones’ head, cocked it and told Jones he was going to “blow his black head off.” 6

71. Also in 1988, Burge requested that Martin intervene with the City Council Finance Committee to obtain private council at the City’s expense to represent him in the Wilson civil trial, and Martin conveyed his request. Letters of 8/23/88 and 10/25/88. 16

72. The City Council approved Burge’s request, William Kunkle, Richard Devine, and their law firm was selected by Burge, and the City paid them approximately $1 million dollars to represent Burge for the next eight years. Letters of 8/23/88 and 10/25/88, Payment Records, Phelan, Pope and John.

73. After Martin transferred Burge to Area 3, key members of Burge’s torture squad - - -including Sergeant Byrne, and Detectives Paladino, Maslanka and Mc Weeny - - - also transferred to Area 3 and allegations of torture began to proliferate there. Plaintiff’s Listing of Known Burge, Area 2 and 3 Torture Victims, 1972-1991.

74. From 1981, when State’s Attorney Daley assumed office, until the end of 1988, when he left office to run for Mayor, approximately 55 victims had alleged torture at Area 2, many allegedly tortured statements had been taken by his assistants, and many motions to suppress where Area 2 torture was alleged had been defended by his office, yet neither Daley nor the SAO initiated any investigations or brought any criminal charges against Burge or any of his men. Id.

75. On July 26, 1989, Mary Powers on behalf of Citizens Alert and several other community groups wrote to OPS Director David Fogel requesting that OPS “reopen an investigation into torture and other abuses by commander Jon Burge,” and that he “support our recommendation that the Chicago Police Board conduct open public hearings into patterns of torture by some members of the Chicago Police Department dating back at least 16 years.” Powers Letter of 7/26/89.

76. In the Powers letter of July 26, 1989, she specifically cited the allegations made by Melvin Jones that he was electric shocked and otherwise abused in February of 1982. Id. 17

77. Neither the OPS nor the CPD opened an investigation into Melvin Jones’ allegations of torture in response to this letter or at any other time.

78. On August 17, 1989, Mary Powers, and other community activists appeared before the Police Board and, in Superintendent Martin”s presence, detailed evidence of a pattern of torture at Area 2 which had come out in the Wilson civil trials, including a description of the torture device, and the finding by the Wilson Jury that there was a pattern and practice of abuse at Area 2, and demanded that a broad investigation be conducted, and that Burge be suspended pending the results of the investigation. Police Board Proceedings, 8/17/89.

79. On September 14, 1989, Mary Powers, and other community activists again
appeared before the Police Board and, in Superintendent Martin”s presence, again raised the torture evidence and the demand that Burge be fired. Superintendent Martin responded by stating: “Commander Burge is working, as far as I know, he’ll be working Ms. Powers. I have no reason to suspend Commander Burge. You want him suspended. I have no reason to suspend
him at this time.” Police Board Proceedings, 9/14/89, pp. 90-91.

80. In September and October of 1989, the City Council held several days of Hearings into police brutality and torture, at which Mayor Daley gave a statement, and Superintendent Martin and OPS Director Fogel attended and testified. City Council Hearings, September 28-; October 6, 10, 11 1989.

81. Mayor Daley made the following statement to the Committee at the Hearings:
“Superintendent Leroy Martin was . . . reappointed by me. He has complete responsibility over the Chicago Police Department. I have full confidence in his administration. He has done an outstanding job.” City Council Hearing, 9/28/89, p. 4.

82. At the hearing, torture at Area 2 was presented through the testimony of Stanley Howard’s mother, OPS Director Fogel was questioned about Burge, electric shock, and 18 baggings at Area 2, Martin was also asked about Howard’s torture, and he promised to look into it. Hearing, 9/29/89, pp 172-215, 10/6/89, pp. 187-96, and 10/10/89, pp. 392-400.

83. On November 30, 1989, Mary Powers, and other community activists again
appeared before the Police Board and, in Superintendent Martin’s presence, again raised the torture evidence and the demand that Burge be fired. Superintendent Martin responded by stating: that he wished the activists would follow up on cases where police officers are shot “the way you are following up on the Burge case and see to it that justice is done to the person who
took my officer’s life.” Police Board Proceedings, 11/30/89, pp. 19-25.

84. On December 24, 1990, the City Council held Christmas Eve hearings, chaired by Finance Committee Chairman Ed Burke, on the question of police torture at Area 2 during which several witnesses presented numerous allegations of police torture at Area 2. City Council. Hearing, 12/24/90.

85. At the Chicago City Council Hearings held in December 24, 1990, counsel for Andrew Wilson tendered the Committee and its counsel, a 21 page document entitled “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His Men.”

86. The “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His
Men” which was tendered by counsel for Andrew Wilson to the Committee and its counsel at the Chicago City Council Hearings held on December 24, 1990, listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at Area 2, including Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, and Leroy Orange.

87. At the Christmas Eve hearing, evidence that SA Daley refused to investigate when requested to do so by Superintendent Brzeczek. was presented, and Daley responded publicly, with his office stating that “Andrew Wilson refused to testify before the grand jury about the 19 allegations.” Chicago Tribune, 12/25/90, “Hearing Examines Brutality Charges;” Chicago Sun Times, 12/25/90, “Davis Urges New Review of Police Brutality Cases.”

88. The “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His
Men” which listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at Area 2, including Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, and Leroy Orange, was tendered by counsel for Andrew Wilson to Superintendent Leroy Martin on or about December 19, 1990.

89. In a letter dated January 9, 1991, OPS Director Gayle Shines wrote to counsel for Andrew Wilson that “Superintendent Martin has referred to me your letter of 19 December and the attached Fact Sheet.”

90. The City Council or its Finance committee never issued a report or took any other action after the December 24th torture hearings.

91. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International issued a Report calling for “a full inquiry into allegations that Chicago police systematically tortured criminal suspects from 1972 to 1984,” and in response, the spokesman for Mayor Daley said she had “‘no comment whatsoever.’” Chicago Sun Times, 1/28/91, “Police Torture Probe Sought Here.”

92. On or about November 2, 1990 OPS Director Gayle Shines approved as
“compelling” and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 25 page Report and findings made by OPS investigator Michael Goldston concerning allegations of torture and abuse at Area 2. This Report included the following findings:
As to the matter of alleged physical abuse, the preponderance of the evidence is that abuse did occur and that it was systematic. The time span involved covers more than ten years. The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture. The evidence presented by some individuals convinced juries and appellate courts that personnel assigned to Area 2 engaged in methodical abuse. 20 The number of incidents in which an Area 2 command member is identified as an accused can lead to only one conclusion. Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and participated in it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end. This conclusion is also supported by the number of incidents in which Area 2 offices are named as the location of the abuse.
OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings, and Cover Letter, Shines to Martin, dated November 2, 1990 (Goldston Report).

93. In her forwarding memo of November 2, 1990, OPS Director Shines, while
approving the conclusions of Goldston and Sanders, further informed Superintendent Martin that they both did “a masterful job of marshaling the facts in this intensive and extensive project and their conclusions are compelling.” 11/2/90 Cover Memo, Shines to Martin, with OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings enclosed.

94. On or about November 2, 1990, OPS Director Gayle Shines approved “as
compelling” and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 66 page report and conclusions of OPS investigator Francine Sanders which found that based on “the overwhelming body of evidence which supports the allegations” that administrative charges of excessive force should be sustained against Jon Burge and John Yucaitis including that they “repeatedly administered electrical stimulation to Mr [Andrew] Wilson’s body in order to create pain” and that Burge “held Mr. Wilson, while handcuffed, against a hot radiator causing burns to Mr. Wilson’s face, chest and thigh.” Chicago Police Office of Professional Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), pp.62-66.

95. Martin acknowledged the “ serious nature” of Goldston’s conclusions Martin memo to Shines, 11/18/90.

96. At no time from receiving the Goldston Report in November of 1990 until he left 21 office in April of 1992, did Martin, OPS Director Shines, or any other City policymaking official take any steps to further investigate the allegations made by the some fifty victims listed in the Goldston report.

97. Instead, Martin, after waiting three months, wrote Shines seeking “further
clarification” concerning the Goldston and Sanders Reports. Memo, Martin to Shines, 2/6/91.

98. Despite all of the torture evidence contained in the Goldston and Sanders Reports, in the Fact Sheet, and that was previously presented to Martin and the City Council, the City and Martin did not seek the prosecution of Burge and his confederates in the Wilson case, for a continuing conspiracy on the basis of the numerous other torture cases listed in the Goldston report, or to prosecute Burge for the numerous other cases which were documented in the
evidence presented, including the Patterson and Madison Hobley cases.

99. In her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Martin, Shines supplied the “clarifications” sought by Martin, and informed him that the OPS findings “reflect the unprecedented comprehensiveness of this investigation.” Shines memo, 4/30/91.

100. With her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Superintendent Martin, OPS Director
Shines included investigator Goldston’s clarification memo, in which Goldston set forth that his investigation established that Area 2 detectives and supervisors Jon Burge, John Byrne, Peter Dignan, Charles Grunhard, John Yucaitis, Thomas McKenna, and Patrick O’Hara were “players”
whose names “repeatedly appeared as connected to allegations of abuse.” Goldston Memo of 4/30/91, attached to Shines Memo to Martin of the same date.

101. After waiting an additional seven months, in November of 1991, Superintendent Leroy Martin approved the findings set forth in the Chicago Police Office of Professional 22 Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, dated October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), Burge and Yucaitis were administratively charged by the CPD for abusing Andrew Wilson in the manner found in the Report, and separation proceedings were initiated before the
Chicago Police Board. Cr 123543 (reopened).

102. However, after secret communications with Corporation Counsel Kelly Welch, which the City still refuses to produce, Martin refused to accept or adopt the Goldston findings, open any additional criminal or administrative investigations into the numerous allegations of Area 2 torture, to commission additional investigation into the alleged systemic pattern and practice of torture, or to discipline or seek criminal charges against any of the named officers, but rather contacted the Police Foundation in order to have them evaluate the methodology used by Goldston in arriving at his findings. Martin Letter to Williams, 11/8/91; City Privilege Log.

103. During this time period, community groups, including Citizen’s Alert, by letters and in face to face meetings, were demanding that Martin release the results of the OPS investigation into torture at Area 2. Powers Letter to Martin, 8/14/91.

104. Instead, Martin, through his lawyers at the Corporation Counsel’s Office, fought production and public release of the Goldston Report and its findings. See, generally, proceedings in Fallon v. Dillon, 90 C 6722.

105. In November of 1991, after Defendant Martin and Corporation Counsel Kelly
Welsh had initiated proceedings before the Police Board to fire Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara for torturing Andrew Wilson, Mayor Daley “defended his decision not to take action against the officers when he was state’s attorney in 1982, explaining that . . [Wilson] refused to cooperate with his office at that time.” Chicago Tribune, 11/26/91 “3 Cops Face Hearing in Torture Case.” 23

106. On or about February 7, 1992, the Goldston and Sanders were publicly released, over the City’s strenuous objection, pursuant to the order of Judge Milton Shadur in the case of Fallon v. Dillon, #90-C-6722.

107. In an article which appeared in the February 8, 1992 Chicago Tribune,
Superintendent Leroy Martin, whgo was one of the previous Area 2 Commanders, was quoted as saying that it was an “outright lie” that Area 2 commanders knew about or condoned torture. Chicago Tribune, “13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged,” February 8, 1992.

108. In the same article, Mayor Richard M. Daley was quoted as saying of the Report, “these are only allegations . . . not substantiated cases,” as defending Martin’s suppression of the report, stating: “it’s allegations, rumors, stories, things like that” and of denying that the torture
at Area 2 was “systematic.” Chicago Tribune, 2/8/92, “13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged;” Los Angeles Times, 2/8/92, “Chicago Police Used Torture Report Says,”

109. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning
Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the following judicial admission concerning the testimony of “seven additional victims of torture tactics at Area II
headquarters:” The testimony regarding similar acts sets forth detailed accounts of tortuous treatment that are almost identical to the torture suffered by Andrew Wilson. The testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara] to torture certain suspects, often with substantial criminal records, into confessing to crimes
or to condone such activity. 24 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, p. 1.

110. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, identified the “seven
additional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters” as Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes,
George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree. Id., pp. 7-
14.
111. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission - - - that the similar acts
testimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin,
Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree
[I]s highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects
to elicit statements. Respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara’s] methods of torture
through electric shock, bagging, and holding a gun to a suspect’s head are more that
sufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes. In addition, the
testimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways
to elicit confessions to violent crimes.
Id. p. 17.
112. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin
Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and
Lawrence Poree:
clearly establishes respondents’ [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara’s] motive and intent in
torturing or condoning the torture of Wilson. Respondents generally engaged in these
similar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime.
Id. p. 22. 25
113. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin
Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and
Lawrence Poree:
shows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at Area II, prior to
and subsequent to Wilson’s arrest, and Burge’s possession of and familiarity with the use
of the devices. It is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the
bagging technique, about which respondents deny knowing, and the technique of putting
a gun to the head of a victim.
Id., p. 24.
114. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission:
There is no question that the similarities between [Andrew] Wilson’s testimony
and the similar victims’ testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard.
Burge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases, and, when he was
not the principal, he was still involved. In the case of all but one of the victims, the
victim was picked up and taken to Area II where he was then interrogated regarding his
knowledge or involvement in a serious offense. Although Donald White was taken
instead to Area I, he was taken there and interrogated by Area II detectives. All of the
victims were black and generally had significant criminal histories.
Also similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with
consequences if they refused to make a statement. After an initial refusal, the
punishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the
refusals to speak persisted. The most striking similarities, however, are found in the
methods of torture used on the suspects. Wilson was electro shocked by Yucaitis using
the black box and by Burge who used the black box and a curling-iron looking device,
was “bagged” and beaten, and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth. Jones,
Holmes, Poree, Powell and Orange were similarly electro shocked by Burge. Holmes,
Powell, White and Mumin were all “bagged” and beaten to the point where they lost or
almost lost consciousness. Burge pointed a cocked gun at Jones’s head, hit Poree in the
head with a pistol, and placed a revolver containing one bullet at Mumin’s head and
snapped it three times slowly. White had a gun placed in his mouth. Additionally, each
of the victims was slapped around and punched.
Burge’s statements to the victims were also very similar. Burge told both Jones
and Mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his. As he did in relation
to Wilson, he referred to the absence of marks on Mumin’s body. He said “fun time” as 26
he approached Wilson and Poree with the black box, and laughed when he bagged
Mumin. He told Wilson he would “fry his black ass” and Jones he would “blow his
black head off.”
As the case law cited above aptly demonstrates, these actions or the condoning of
these actions are overwhelming in their similarity.
Id., pp. 25-26.
115. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the
following judicial admission:
Given the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the
similar victims will testify, there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time
to be relevant to this case. Tak[ing] the offenses in sequence, they reveal a pattern of
almost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes.
While the sequence spans twelve years, each offense is close enough to the next to
connect it to the relevant pattern of behavior. Moreover, Melvin Jones’ and Donald
White’s testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before Andrew
Wilson was tortured.
Id., p. 28.
116. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:
Indeed, as the testimony of the similar victims shows, respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and
O’Hara] counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict
when they persisted in their pattern of torture.
Id., p. 28.
117. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, Jon Burge, Patrick
O’Hara and John Yucaitis, 86-C-2360, entitled “City of Chicago’s Memorandum in Response
To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers,
made the following judicial admission:
Plaintiff Andrew Wilson has testified that he was beaten, kicked, punched, burned by
being harnessed to a radiator, and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands, face, ears, and 27
between his legs by defendant police officers. Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that
this outrageous conduct, unsanctioned and condemned by the City, and for which
defendant officers were fired and/or disciplined, was within the defendants’ scope of
employment.
City Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 1.
118. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, entitled
“City of Chicago’s Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for
Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the following judicial admission:
The instrumentalities by which defendants tortured plaintiff also illustrate that defendant
officers were not in the scope of their employment. Plaintiff has failed to furnish any
evidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him - - -the black
box device and the modified curling iron - - were furnished by the City.
Id., p. 17.
119. In its Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for
Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the judicial admission that
Burge “cruelly torture[d]” Andrew Wilson and “denie[d] him necessary medical
assistance.”
Id., p. 19.
120. In this Memorandum, the City, through its lawyers, made the following admission
concerning it change of position from defending Burge for his alleged torture of Andrew Wilson
to asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of Burge’s
employment: “The change in the City’s position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the
City in good faith and in the public interest.” Id. p. 12.
121. On July 30, 1992, almost two years after Superintendent Martin had first received
the Goldston findings, the Police Foundation submitted its report to Superintendent of Police
Matt Rodriguez. After noting that because “hangings, shockings, ‘baggings’ beatings, chokings,
and beatings were alleged to occur, many in the Area 2 Headquarters itself, a thorough and
rigorous investigation seemed required,” and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture
alleged had in fact took place, the Report criticized Goldston’s methodology. Police Foundation 28
Report, “An Analysis of the Methods Employed in the Preparation of the Goldston Report,”
7/30/92.
122. The Police Foundation recommended, inter alia, that the Chicago Police
Department investigate or re-investigate cases of serious misconduct listed in the Goldston
Report, create a database concerning these investigations, rigorously and uniformly investigate
them, and create a monitoring system to identify patterns of serious police misconduct. Id.
123. Almost three years after first receiving the Goldston Report, OPS Director Shines
reopened the Cannon, Howard, Adkins, Craft, Holmes, White and Michael Johnson cases and
assigned OPS investigators to them. Numerous other serious Area 2 torture cases, including
those of Plaintiff, Leroy Orange, Melvin Jones, Anthony Homes, George Powell, and Madison
Hobley, were not opened or reopened. Shines’ Dep. in Santiago v. Marquez; CRs of named
Victims.
124. Leroy Orange testified on May 22,1985, at his trial that on January 12, 1984 he
was taken to Area 2 and interrogated. During this interrogation, he was handcuffed behind his
back to a circle in the wall, a plastic bag was put over his head, and when the bag was put over
his head a second time he was punched in the stomach. People v. Orange, 5/22/85, pp. 1112-14.
125. Leroy Orange further testified that he was shocked on the arm with an electrical
device, and that an officer stuck his hands between his legs and squeezed his testicles. Id. at
1114; Affidavits of Leroy Orange.
126. Leroy Orange averred in ¶¶ 11-13 of an affidavit that he was interviewed in the
summer of 1990 by a male OPS investigator at Pontiac Correctional Center, and after reviewing
a stack of photographs, he identified Jon Burge as one of the detectives involved in his torture. 29
127. OPS Investigator Michael Goldston listed Orange as a victim tortured by Burge in
his 1990 OPS report. Goldston Report.
128. Detectives McWeeny and Madigan testified at Orange’s trial that they were
partners and they arrested Orange on January 12, 1984, and they transported him to Area 2
Headquarters where they locked him in an interview room, and the next day they conducted lineups with him. People v. Orange, pp. 615-17, 624,1232-34.
129. Leroy Orange stated at his bond hearing on January 14, 1984 that he had pin marks
on his butt, that was the only visible bruise he had to show, and that “other things happened.”
People v. Orange, Kidd, 1/14/84, p. 3.
130. Orange’s co-defendant, Leonard Kidd, also stated at the January 14th bond hearing
that he was hurting between his legs where the police jumped on him, and his lawyer also noted
on the record that Kidd was limping and that he came in injured. Id.
131. On February 9, 1984, Orange’s attorney told a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times
that officers administered electrical shocks to Orange’s buttocks and anus with a “black box.”
“Cop ‘black box’ torture charged,” Chicago Sun Times, 2/9/84.
132. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Chicago Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that:
In January of 1984, Leroy Orange was taken to Area II where he was interrogated and
tortured while Burge was in the room. Orange was shocked and jolted repeatedly with a
black box plugged into the wall. Orange’s pants were pulled down while electroshock
was applied to his body, including his buttocks. He was then asked if he was ready to
make a statement, and he replied that he was. Orange reported this torture to his
attorney, Earl Washington, who reported it to the media..
Memorandum In Opposition, January 22, 1992, p. 13.
133. In February of 1984, the OPS registered a complaint, number 136454, alleging that 30
Jon Burge and others who allegedly tortured Leroy Orange on January 12 and 13, 1984.
134. The OPS entered a not sustained finding on these allegations without ever taking a
statement from Orange, Burge or any other Area 2 detective or supervisor.
135. The Chicago Police Department has since destroyed the OPS file in complaint
number 136454.
136. On or about September 24, 1979, the OPS registered complaint number 108817
alleging that George Powell was beaten and suffocated with a bag while being questioned at
Area 2, the OPS entered a not sustained finding on these allegations without ever taking a
statement from Powell, Burge, or any other Area 2 detective or supervisor, and the Chicago
Police Department has since destroyed the OPS file in complaint number 108817.
137. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago
lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted
that:
On September 20, 1979, George Powell was arrested at his girlfriend’s house and
taken to Area II where he was handcuffed to a wall. Burge brought in a long object with a
cord, similar to a cattle prod, and said he was go to do to Powell what he had done to
“Satan.” Burge shocked Powell on his stomach and chest, such that Powell almost passed
out. Also, while slapping ans questioning Powell, Burge put a bag over Powell’s head
and Powell had to bite a hole in it in order to breathe. Powell’s mother filed a complaint
with the office of Professional standards, who ultimately made a finding of not sustained.
Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 in the Matter of Charges Filed against
Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick o’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, p. 9.
138. In a statement taken on June 14, 2004, George Powell stated that he was electric
shocked, suffocated with a plastic bag, and beaten by Jon Burge and other Area 2 detectives
during his interrogation in September of 1999. 31
139. On May 11, 1989, Andrew Wilson's lawyers in Wilson’s civil rights trial filed
"Plaintiff's Proffer of Other Acts of Beating, Torture and Electroshock By Defendant Burge and
Other Detectives." and served it on the City through counsel.
140. “Plaintiff’s Proffer “listed 19 alleged victims of Burge, Sergeant Byrne, and their
fellow Area 2 detectives.
141. “Plaintiff’s Proffer” listed Anthony “Satan” Holmes, stating:
Anthony Holmes, nicknamed “Satan, ” was taken to Area II headquarters at
approximately 4:00 a.m. Jon Burge presided over his interrogation, during which, in an
effort to obtain a confession, plastic bags were put over his head, causing him to pass out
three separate times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock device, housed in a
black box, to Holmes’ handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock, and causing him to
fall out of his chair and roll on the floor.
142. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:
On May 30, 1973, at approximately 4:00 a.m., Anthony Holmes, whose street name is
“Satan,” was taken to Area II headquarters where he was held, interrogated and tortured
for approximately six hours. Respondent Burge presided over his interrogation, during
which, in an effort to obtain a confession, plastic bags were placed over Holmes’ head,
causing him to pass out three times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock
device, housed in a black box, to Holmes’ handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock,
which caused him to fall out of his chair and roll on the floor. The shock was extremely
painful and caused Holmes to press his jaws together and grit his teeth.
Memorandum In Opposition filed on January 22, 1992, p. 9.

Lawrence Poree was interrogated on two occasions in 1973 by Burge and Hoke. The
first time they showed him a wooden box, with no top and a generator inside with two
wires. Burge said “this is what we got for niggers like you.” Later (that year) Burge and
Hoke put Poree, while handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants
down and applied electric shock to his arm, testicles and under his armpits.
146. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that:
Lawrence Poree will testify that on two occasions in 1973, he was interrogated by
respondent Burge and another detective. The first time they showed him a wooden box
with no top, a generator inside, and two wires. Burge then said, “this is what we’ve got
for niggers like you.” Later in 1973, Burge and [detective] Hoke put Poree, while
handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants down and applied
electroshock to his arm and armpits, and to his testicles.
On August 7, 1979, Poree was arrested and brought to Area II where he was
interrogated by Burge. Poree was handcuffed in the interrogation room, and the black
box was on the table. Burge came in and said, “fun time again.” Poree was handcuffed
to the wall and hit in the head with a pistol. Apparently referring to Anthony Holmes,
Burge said “You can ask your fat friend about the box.” Burge shocked Poree eight or
nine times on the arms, chest, forehead, and back, causing him to clench his teeth and
bite his tongue and his mouth to bleed.

149. In U.S. ex. rel. Maxwell v. Gilmore, 1999 WL 130331 (N.D.Ill.) at *14; Judge
Shadur stated the following in his decision:
It is now common knowledge that in the early to mid-1980s Chicago Police Commander
Jon Burge and many officers working under him regularly engaged in the physical abuse 33
and torture of prisoners to extract confessions. Both internal police accounts and
numerous lawsuits and appeals brought by suspects alleging such abuse substantiate that
those beatings and other means of torture occurred as an established practice, not just on
an isolated basis.
150. At the May 13, 2003 oral argument in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in US
ex. rel. Leonard Hinton v. McArdory, Seventh Circuit Judge Diane Wood made the following statement
from the bench: “terrible things were happening in Area 2, things that should make us ashamed
of our police force and justice system.”
151. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 120 F.3d 681, 683-85 (7th Cir. 1997), the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals held that Defendant Burge acted within the scope of his employment
with the City “when he tortured Wilson,” stating:
Burge was not pursuing a frolic of his own. He was enforcing the criminal law of Illinois
overzealously by extracting confessions from criminal suspects by improper means. He
was, as it were, too loyal an employee. He was acting squarely within the scope of his
employment.

replied that he had no knowledge of what burge was talking about. Burge told Mumin
he would talk before Mumin left left there and tightened Mumin’s handcuffs. The
handcuffs were painful and cut off Mumin’s circulation. Burge then left the room.

bagging, he said he would tell them anything they wanted to know. Id. at 19-20.
214. White testified that every time the bag was placed over his head, he was hit, and
O’Hara, McKenna, Hill and two others were in the room and stood in a circle around him. Id.
at 22-23.
215. White further testified that every time he got a detail wrong during the questioning,
Detective Hill threatened to hit him and Hill then started to play with his gun and said that he
should make him run, shoot him and say that he tried to escape. Id. at 19-21. 47
216. White testified that after they took a statement from him and he took a lie detector
test, Hill threatened to shoot him or push him out of a window. Id. at 26, 107.
217. After reviewing 39 photographs at his deposition on July 14, 1989, White
identified a picture of Jon Burge as one of the officers who was in the room during the bagging
and beating. He also identified Detective Hill’s photograph and stated that he was the officer
who put the bag over his head. Id. at 32-36, 38-40, 47, 56.
218. White further testified that at one time while he had the bag over his head, one of
the officers put a gun to his mouth, and at another point, he was hit with fists and a book, or a
stack of something. Id. at 42, 62.
219. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago
lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:
On the evening of February 12, 1982, two days before Andrew Wilson’s arrest, Donald
White was picked up by police officers and taken to 11th and State. He was taken to a
room on the 5th floor by Hill, McKenna, Katalinic and respondent O’Hara, and they
began asking him who killed the police officers. They continued to ask him and White
repeatedly told them that he did not shoot the officers. Hill got mad and said “I am tired
of this fucking shit.” He took a black garbage bag and put it over White’s head and then
someone began beating him on his head. Although he could not see them with the bag
over his head, there had to have been at least four people hitting him. O’Hara was in
the room, as was Burge at various times. When White still stated that he did not shoot
the officers and did not know anything, they put the bag back over his head two more
times and beat him again. White almost lost consiousness. At one point, someone
stuck a gun in his mouth. White then said he would tell them anything they wanted to
know. Hill then asked him questions, and, when White didn’t have it right, Hill
pretended he was going to hit White.
White testified to these facts in a deposition taken in connection with Andrew
Wilson’s civil trial. White had not told anyone for five years that he had been abused
because he feared for his life at the hands of the police officers. When he finally agreed
to testify about the abuse he suffered, he did so only on the condition that
Wilson’s lawyers would move him out of Illinois. In addition, because he was
afraid and did not know who he could trust, he did not file an OPS complaint. His
mother, however, did file an OPS complaint in connection with his torture at the hands
of the police officers. OPS reached a finding of “not sustained.” 48
Memorandum In Opposition filed on January 22, 1992 in the Matter of Charges Filed against

torture, including Pienta, William Marley, and William Pederson, were present again Id.,, pp.
405-7.
224. Patterson testified that on this second occasion, the "bagging" went on for at least
two minutes, he was again punched on the body when the bag was over his head, and that
suffocation was even more unbearable than the first time, so he stated to the detectives that he
would say "anything you say." Id, pp. 406-7. 49

fucking up," took his revolver out, put it on the table top, and said "we told you if you don't do
what we tell you to, you're going to get something worse than before -- it will have been a snap
compared to what you will get." Patterson further testified that the red haired officer then asked
Petitioner if he was going to cooperate, said that if Petitioner revealed the torture, "its your
word against ours and who are they going to believe, you or us," and stated that they could do
anything they wanted to do to him. Id., pp. 417-19.
229. Patterson further testified that a second ASA, Peter Troy, came in sometime the
next day with Detective Madigan, he first agreed to make a statement then refused to do so or to
sign a written statement which Troy had written out. Id., pp. 422-34. 50
230. Aaron Patterson testified that he continued to refuse to sign the statement, ASA

234. In his affidavit and in his Cannon testimony, Dr. Martinez averred that during
his evaluation of Patterson, he determined whether "psychological markers identifying post
Traumatic Stress Disorder resulting from torture were present, and whether [Petitioner's]
present psychological condition showed evidence of a past incident of torture," and determined
that in his expert opinion, Patterson "was tortured at Area 2 during his interrogation" because he
exhibited "six categories of psychological markers which qualify under Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder as it is described by the American Psychiatric Association's DSM IV (1994)." (Id., ¶¶ 51

wouldn't believe it. We have evidence from four men, who did not know each other, all
getting beaten and tortured and convicted on the basis of the confessions they allegedly
provided. They are perfect examples of what is so terribly broken about our system.

wrote the following concerning the five day manhunt in February of 1982 which resulted in the
arrest and torture of Andrew Wilson:
The five-day manhunt was directed by Burge, the violent crimes commander in Area
Two. It dominated the news. Mayor Jane Byrne offered a $50,000 reward and met with
Burge during the investigation. A now retired Area Two detective who took part in the
dragnet told the Reader that "there were a million volunteers....Normally you'd have 15 to
20 violent crimes guys on duty. Now you've got not only them, you've got the property
crimes guys, the gang crimes guys. Detectives from Area One were there. The brass was
there because it was such a heater case....My partner and I worked 36 hours straight.
Burge had to send someone to his house to get clean socks and a shirt. He didn't go
home." The detective said, "It was a reign of terror. I don't know what Kristallnacht was
like, but this was probably close." Complaints were widespread, with Jesse Jackson
saying that the community was living "under military occupation."

346. Dr. Kirschner further testified that in his opinion there was a pattern and practice
of torture at Area 2 and later at Area 3 Headquarters under the command of Jon Burge, and that
this opinion was based, inter alia, on his evaluations of several alleged Area 2 and 3 torture 71
victims, including Andrew Wilson, Darrell Cannon, Leroy Orange and Marcus Wiggins,
discussions with Chicago detectives who acknowledged that there was police torture at Area 2,
the fact that frequent allegations of electric shock, bagging, Russian Roulette only arose from
Area 2 and later from Area 3 Headquarters while Jon Burge was the commander, and not
against other officers in other station houses, and that the patterns and methodologies at Area 2
and 3 under Burge and Byrne closely mirrored those which he observed, investigated, and
evaluated in places such as Turkey and Israel. Id. at 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96.

348. Brzeczek further averred that he made the following true and accurate statements
to Chicago Tribune reporter Steve Mills which appeared in an April 29 2002 Chicago Tribune
article:
Twenty years later, Brzeczek, now a defense attorney, said that there is ‘no doubt in my
mind’ that Burge and his detectives tortured some suspects. The whole situation at Area 2
[was] a disgrace and an embarrassment. It’s time something is done about it,” Brzeczek

allegedly occurred.

Police Department, [he] monitored litigation initiated by persons making claims and/or
allegations regarding torture sustained at the hands of police officers at Detective Division Area
2. [He] further monitored the prosecution of certain police officers previously assigned to Area 2
based on allegations of torture and other improper treatment of prisoners under their control 72

actions arising out of allegations of torture and other improper treatment brought by persons
against police officers assigned to Detective Division Area 2.” Id., ¶ 10.
350. Brzeczek further averred that “based on the fact that allegations continued to arise
alleging torture and other improper treatment occurring at a time after [he] left the Chicago
Police Department on April 29, 1983, and based upon the fact that Richard M. Daley, State’s
Attorney of Cook County, did not conduct (or at least affiant is not aware of any such action),
any investigation into the allegations brought to his attention by the affiant in the letter as
aforesaid, affiant was and is convinced that some persons held in custody at Area 2 had to be
tortured.” Id., ¶11.
351. In his affidavit, Brzeczek further averred that “based on the sheer number of the
allegations, the findings of the courts in certain litigation brought against officers assigned to the
Detective Division Area 2, and the fact that police officers were discharged and/or suspended for
their roles in allegations made against them for the improper treatment of prisoners while
assigned to Detective Division Area 2, the affiant was and is convinced that some persons were
tortured while in custody at Detective Division Area 2.” Id., ¶12.

358. On or about October 19, 1987, OPS Director Fogel sent a document entitled
“Proposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,” to the Mayor of the City of Chicago
in which he wrote:
By accepting all cases, even erring on the liberal side, to be accommodative to the
public, OPS gives the appearance of moving forward on all complaints. The opposite
occurs. The appearance of doing a thorough investigation with full due process
and endless unnecessary reviews for all, actually operates to immunize police
from internal discipline, increases their overtime, leads to an enormous “paper storm”
and has institutionalized lying.

360. In Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d 985, (7th Cir. 1987) the Seventh Circuit 76
Court of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict against Area 2 Violent Crimes detectives, supervisors
and commanding officers, including detectives James Houtsma, Dennis McGuire, John McCabe,
and Raymond McNally, Sgt. Alvin Palmer, Lt. Griffith, and Commander Milton Deas, for
conspiracy to “railroad” 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:
We cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the
individual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to
railroad George Jones.
Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d at 992.
361. In Jones v. City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the
City of Chicago for maintaining a “street files”custom or policy which led to the railroading of
18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:
The custom in question is the maintenance of the "street files," police
files withheld from the state's attorney and therefore unavailable as a
source of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute
or, failing that, would at least be available to defense counsel under
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). As
we noted recently, information undermining the credibility of a government
witness is within the scope of Brady's rule. See United States v.
Herrera-Medina, 853 F.2d 564, slip op. at 5 (7th Cir. 1988).
Although the lawfulness of the street-files practice has never been
adjudicated, the City, which has abandoned the practice, does not challenge
the jury's implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process
of law. Brady v. Maryland does not require the police to keep written
records of all their investigatory activities; but attempts to circumvent
the rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files
deliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be
tolerated. The City sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in
this court.
There is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files
played a role in Jones's misfortunes. Cf. Harris v. City of Pagedale, 821
F.2d 499, 507 (8th Cir. 1987). If the state's attorney had had [*996]
access to them, he would have discovered memos by Kelly and especially by
Laverty that would have given any prosecutor pause. Alternatively, defense 77
counsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have
ended even sooner than it did. The only question is whether this custom was
a custom of the City of Chicago. As the custom was department-wide
and of long standing, the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been
consciously approved at the highest policy-making level for decisions
involving the police department -- the standard suggested by the recent
plurality opinion in City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S.
Ct. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988). See also Stokes v. Bullins, 844 F.2d 269,
273 (5th Cir. 1988).

horror chamber. We know how to squeeze a man’s nuts.” When they returned to
Chicago, Burge asked if the man on duty was the one who killed Fred Hampton
and Mark Clark. Burge said “when we get through with you you’ll be glad to tell
us what we want.”

rooms. Burge laughed when each asked for an attorney saying “you know better
than that.’ Lewis was hit in the throat and slapped in the side of the head, injuring

561. Mastin further averred that pictures were taken of Smith which showed his distorted
face and that Moore later told him that he was punched during his questioning. Id., pp 19-20.
562. In his statement, Mastin averred that there was a motion to suppress hearing at
which evidence of the beatings was presented and at which Burge and other detectives testified
and denied any abuse. Id., pp 25-26.
563. In a sworn court reported statement taken on August 25, 2004, Ollie Hammonds
averred that on or about September 21, 1979, he was arrested by Chicago Police officers, 108
including Jon Burge, and George Basile,, and taken to Area 2 where he was questioned about
the same homicide that George Powell was arrested for. 8/25/04 Hammonds Statement, pp. 2-5.
564. Hammonds further averred that when he denied involvement, Burge, Basile, and
two other detectives beat him on his chest and legs. These beatings continued for six to eight
hours. Id. pp. 6-8.
565. Hammonds further averred that sometime during this six to eight hour period,
Basile produced a black box, the size of a car battery, which had prongs sticking up and two
wires extending from it. Id., pp. 8-9.
566. Hammonds further averred that Burge asked him did he know what this did to a
man’s dick if we put the two wires on it, and Basile demonstrated it by touching the two wires
together, and sparks jumped out. Id., p. 9.
567. Hammonds averred that he told them he would tell them what they wanted him to
say, but he would tell the judge that they told him to say it. The detectives were not satisfied, and
they moved him to a cell where they handcuffed him to the wall, and held him incommunicado
for two and one half days, without food, water, or access to the washroom. Id., pp. 9-10, 13
568. Hammonds further averred that during this period of time, he refused to cooperate,
and Burge, Basile, and the other detectives punched him on numerous occasions. Id., pp. 10-11.
569. Hammonds averred that he was charged with the same murder as George Powell
was charged with, was held inCounty Jail for 33 days, then released when the Judge found no
probable cause. Id., pp. 15-16.
570. In an OPS statement, Ty Shaun Ross stated that he was electric shocked and
otherwise abused by Area 3 detectives, including Daniel McWeeny, while he was being 109
interrogated on June 5, 1991. CR 185626.
571. [Deleted] while his co-defendant, Travis Richardson, stated that his head was

572. All of the 100 alleged victims of police torture and abuse by Area 2 and Area 3
detectives and supervisors whose allegations are known to the Plaintiff are African-American.
Plaintiff’s Listing of Known Burge, Area 2 and 3 Torture Victims, 1972-1991.
573. On April 24, 2002, Judge Paul Biebel, Chief Judge of the Cook County Criminal
Division, appointed Special Prosecutors Edward Egan and Robert Boyle to investigate
allegations of police torture and abuse at Area 2 and Area 3.
574. On June 8, 2004, in open court, Special Prosecutor Robert Boyle stated that the
Special Prosecutor’s Office was investigating 108 cases of alleged torture and physical abuse at
Area 2 and 3. In Re: The Matters of Leonard Bajenski, et. al., June 8, 2004, p. 27.
575. From 1972 to the present, the only police department discipline which has been
imposed against any Area 2 or Area 3 detective, supervisor, or command officer for any
allegations of torture or physical abuse made against them has been the firing of Jon Burge and
the suspension of John Yucaitis for the torture of Andrew Wilson on February 14, 1982.
576. From 1972 to the present, the City of Chicago and its Police Department has
conducted no criminal investigations into any of the allegations of torture or other physical abuse
made against Area 2 and Area 3 detectives and supervisors, including, but not limited to, the
alleged victims named above.
577. From 1972 to the present, the City of Chicago and its Police Department has not
sought criminal charges against any Area 2 and Area 3 detective or supervisor on the basis of 110
allegations of torture or other physical abuse, including, but not limited to, those made by the
alleged victims named above.
578. On February 11, 1993., the Chicago Police Board ordered that Jon Burge be
separated from the Chicago Police Department and John Yucaitis be suspended for 15 months
for torturing and physically abusing Andrew Wilson. In The Matter of the Charges Filed
Against Jon Burge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993).
579. On February 10, 1994, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Thomas O’Brien
affirmed the Police Board’s order separating Burge and suspending Yucaitis, and on December
15, 1995, the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed Judge O’Brien’s ruling. Burge v. Police Board of
the City of Chicago, No. 93 CH 2265, (Circuit Court of Cook County, February 10, 1994);

of evidence of Area 2 or 3 torture and abuse in the following cases:
a. Andrew Wilson : People v. Wilson, 116 Ill.2d 29 (1987);
b. Darrell Cannon: People v. Cannon, 293 lll. App. 3d 634 (1997);

h. Jesse Clemon: People v. Clemon, 259 Ill. App.3d 5, (1994).
582. In a May 21, 2003 Chicago Tribune article, Special Prosecutor Egan was quoted as
saying: "We believe something happened. You'd have to be a chump not to." “Probers Believe
Brutality Claims,” Chicago Tribune, May 21, 2003.
583. On March 3, 1998, upon becoming Police Superintendent, Terry Hillard told the
Chicago Sun Times that “barring new evidence, it's time to close the book on the Burge era and
move on.” Hillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36, 43-46
584. In an August 31, 1998 memo from the office of the Superintendent , Thomas
Needham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional
Standards, Needham listed the following cases:
Darrell Cannon CR#134723
Stanley Howard CR# 142017
Gregory Banks CR# 188617
Lee Holmes CR# 126802
Philip Adkins CR# 142201
Donald White CR# 169867
Lavert Jones CR# 200390
Stanley Ware CR# 202019 112
Michael Johnson CR# 125071
and wrote that “you are hereby instructed to classify all of the allegations in the above
referenced complaint register files as ‘not sustained.’” August 31, 1998 memo from Thomas
Needham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional
Standards.
585. As a basis for this unprecedented order, Needham cited the age of the cases and the
purported lack of “new evidence,” when, in fact, a wealth of new evidence had been developed
by the OPS investigators in almost all of the cases. Id.; CR files of listed cases; Testimony of
OPS investigators at People v. Cannon Hearing.
586. Superintendent Hillard, after talking to Neeedham about his decision, ratified his
actions in “not sustaining’” these cases, stating, under oath, that “I support Tom Needham 100
percent when it comes down to representing me in this department in hard cases like that.”
Hillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36.
587. In a letter dated August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, addressed to Superintendent
Terry Hillard, OPS Director Callie Baird and Police Board President Demitrius Carney, the
signators wrote:
We write as a group of public officials, citizens and organizations concerned with
police violence and discipline to urge you to immediately reopen and review several
Office of Professional Standards (OPS) investigations into police torture, and to open
investigations in numerous other torture cases where no OPS investigations have been
conducted. We further urge you to commission an independent investigation into the
obvious violations of police regulations and procedure and legal process by certain OPS
and police officials during the torture investigations which were conducted by the OPS.
August 2, 1999 Letter from Citizens Alert, Mary Powers et. al. to Hillard, Carney, and Baird.
588. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators further wrote: 113
Recent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the
OPS reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior OPS
findings that physical abuse of African American suspects at Area 2 from 1973 to 1986
included "psychological techniques and planned torture," was "systematic," and
"methodical," and that Area 2 command members, particularly Jon Burge, "were aware
of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or
failing to take any action to bring it to an end." Goldston Report, pp 2-3. The now public
evidence further reveals that OPS investigators Tillman, Lawrence, and Cosey conducted
thorough investigations in each of these cases, discovered new evidence not available
during the initial investigations, and sustained findings in six of the cases. The sustained
findings included findings that victims were electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic
bag, suspended in air by their handcuffs, beaten and stomped, and racially abused. The
evidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police
officers who were and are still Chicago police officers in good standing, most notably
Lieutenant Peter Dignan, who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him
in five of the six cases. The evidence further reveals that these findings and the
investigative files were tendered to OPS Director Gayle Shines in 1994 for her review,
and that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995, at
the same time that Peter Dignan was nominated by the Mayor and the Department for
merit promotion to Lieutenant. Ms. Shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500
sustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as Director, she
overturned a total of 10 cases, including these four against Dignan.
The evidence further shows that in the other two cases, Darrell Cannon and Stanley
Howard, Ms. Shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture, but
rather kept these files in her office for four years, together with the other seven files.
Cannon, who was on trial in a murder case, and Howard, who is on death row, sought
these files by subpoena, but Shines and the Department failed to produce these files,
which contained highly exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, after Ms. Shines left the OPS
in 1998, counsel to the Superintendent, Thomas Needham, obtained the nine torture files
from the OPS and, without consultation with the Superintendent, summarily reversed the
sustained findings and closed the cases. Needham, who, as a longtime assistant state’s
attorney, was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims, including
Cannon, admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on
the merits of the cases, but rather on the fact that the files had languished in Shines’
office for so long a period of time. The Superintendent never reviewed these cases on the
merits as he is required by police procedure to do, and he only learned of his counsel’s
unjustifiable actions by reading about them in a February 1999 Chicago Tribune article.
Additionally, the public evidence reveals that the OPS failed to investigate numerous
additional documented cases of police torture against African American suspects. In the
case of Melvin Jones, Mary Powers of Citizen’s Alert specifically requested by a letter
dated July 26, 1989 that the OPS open an investigation into the recently revealed
allegations that Jones was electric shocked at by Jon Burge and several other Area 2
detectives who remain on the force to this day. Contrary to police and OPS procedure, no
investigation was ever opened, despite the fact that the City has subsequently admitted in 114
official court papers that Jones was in fact tortured. Similarly, in the Shadeed Mumin
case, an investigation was opened and OPS investigators developed compelling new
evidence that he was tortured by Burge and an unidentified detective. Just as the OPS
investigator was about to identify this officer, the OPS discontinued the investigation,
supposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number.
In numerous other cases, including Aaron Patterson and nine other men who are
presently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from
them, the OPS has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious
allegations.
Id.
589. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators made the following demands:
1. Given Ms. Shines’ clear misconduct, lack of objectivity, and failure to complete her
review of the Cannon and Howard sustained findings, that new OPS Director, Callie
Baird, conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture
cases;
2. If Ms. Baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings, that the
Superintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits, as he is required by
police procedure to do;
3. That counsel Thomas Needham be disqualified from any role in reviewing or
otherwise participating in any torture investigations;
4. That Peter Dignan and any other active officers against whom torture findings were
entered by OPS investigators be suspended pending complete review;
5. That the department and its OPS open an investigation into the allegations that Melvin
Jones was electric shocked by Jon Burge and other still active detectives and consider
in making its findings that the City has admitted that Jones was in fact tortured;
6. That the Department and its OPS reopen and complete the Shadeed Mumin
investigation;
7. That the Department and its OPS open investigations into the other numerous
documented cases of police torture, as listed in the Appendix attached hereto,
including those allegations made by men on death row;
8. That the Department commission an independent investigation into the serious
violations of departmental rules and court process by high ranking police and OPS
officials, including Thomas Needham and Gayle Shines;
9. That the Department and the OPS Director meet with representatives from the
undersigned groups and discuss these proposals and to periodically report on the
progress of these investigations;
10.That these investigations and findings be subject to public scrutiny.
Id. 115
590. In the August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, the signators set forth the following cases
for Director Baird’s Review:

592. Superintendent Hillard subsequently met with representatives from the signators of
the August 2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter.
593. Other than Hillard’s meeting with representatives from the signators of the August
2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter, no action was taken on any of the demands made in the letter. 116
594. In an e mail dated 1/10/02, Corporation Counsel Mara S. Georges wrote to her
assistant: “Sheila O’Grady would like us to explore bringing an action against Burge. Will you
please think about it and give us your thoughts?” “New documents Report that City Considered
Suing Burge, City continues Paying For Fired Commander’s Legal Defense,” NBC 5.com.,
4/29/04.
595. On January 1, 2002, Sheila O’Grady was Mayor Daley’s Chief of Staff. Id.
596. In response, Jeffrey Given, Georges’ assistant, wrote that suing Burge “would
seem to undercut our ability to defend [against the inmates’] suit by challenging the underlying
facts . . .” “City Considered Suing Burge; Officials Weighed Their Options to Fight Growing
Uproar over Torture Allegations Against the Fired Police Commander,” Chicago Tribune,
4/29/04.
597. Mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum, Given and
Georges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative
publicity about Burge and the City’s role in the torture scandal. Id.
598. Given and Georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide
variety of reasons, including that some of Burge’s men were still on the police force, the
department had been embarrassed by Needham’s unilateral shelving of the OPS torture
investigations despite the investigators’ sustained findings, and that the Tribune’s then recent
series on the continuing CPD practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention
on the issue, and Given further stated “but query how we’ll do in the court of public opinion
after a long, public, expensive and embarrassing discovery process?” NBC5.com; Chicago
Tribune.
599. Instead of suing Burge, or otherwise distancing the City from him, the City decided 117
to invest unlimited public funds in representing Burge and at least thirty-five other Area 2
detectives accused of torture and abuse in the four torture cases and to fight production and
public disclosure of additional documents that would further expose the City’s central role in the
torture scandal in civil and criminal cases and with the Special Prosecutor. Id.
600. On August 27, 2004 in his sworn testimony before the Prisoner Review Board,
former Area 2 Commander and Superintendent Leroy Martin falsely denied that he did not have
contemporaneous knowledge of the allegations of torture and abuse against Jon Burge and other
Area 2 detectives while he was Commander. Tr. of 8/27/04 Parole Revocation Hearing of Darrell
Cannon.
601. In her concurring opinion in Hinton v. Uchtman (sub. nom.)___F 3d ___ (7th Cir.
2005), Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood found:
[T]he claim Hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the
high price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant: a
cloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched . . . [A] mountain of
evidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the Area Two station
of the Chicago Police Department during the exact time period pertinent to
Hinton's case. Eventually, as this sorry tale came to light, the Office of
Professional Standards Investigation of the Police Department looked into the
allegations, and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the
command of Lt. Jon Burge — the officer in charge of Hinton's case — had been a
regular part of the system for more than ten years. And, in language reminiscent
of the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious Abu Ghraib facility in Iraq,
the report said that "[t]he type of abuse described was not limited to the usual
beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and
planned torture." The report detailed specific cases, such as the case of Andrew
Wilson, who was taken to Area Two on February 14, 1982. There a group led by
Burge beat Wilson, stuffed a bag over his head, handcuffed him to a radiator, and
repeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears, nose, and genitals. See People
v. Wilson, 506 N.E.2d 571 (Ill. 1987). Burge eventually lost his job with the
police, though not until 1992. See In the Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon
Burge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993). To this day,
Burge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions, though it appears that he
at least thinks that he may still be at some risk of prosecution. See, for example, 118
"Cop brutality probe must be thorough, fair," Chi. Sun-Times, May 16, 2002
(editorial); Hal Dardick, "Burge repeatedly takes 5th; Former police commander
stays mum on torture questions," Chi. Tribune, Sept. 2, 2004 (noting allegations
that Burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 Black and Latino suspects
between August 1972 and September 1991). . . .
Behavior like that attributed to Burge imposes a huge cost on society: it
creates distrust of the police generally, despite the fact that most police officers
would abhor such tactics, and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in
which the problem officer played a role. Indeed, the alleged conduct is so
extreme that, if proven, it would fall within the prohibitions established by the
United Nations Convention Against Torture ("CAT"), which defines torture as
"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is
intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a
third person information or a confession . . .," thereby violating the fundamental
human rights principles that the United States is committed to uphold. . . .Embed
