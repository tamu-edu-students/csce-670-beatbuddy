Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

[Chorus]
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh, baby, won't you come again?
She said, "I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering"

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it, but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you do
You might also like[Chorus]
And I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

[Verse 2]
It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
Oh, and you say (You say) I'm such a cliché
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it, but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you do

[Chorus]
I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
[Outro]
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well, I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart44Embed
