Yo
Ready

[Verse 1]
Blazin' without the license
Crazy without the silence
Wavy without the pirates
Gassed when I light it
Blazin' without the license
Crazy without the silence
Wavy without the pirates
Gassed when I light it

[Verse 2]
I love when everyting turn up
I'm blessed when the fire ignited
And if it ain't, I don't turn up
You know I get gassed when I light
Gassed up, you know I get gassed
You know I get gassed when I light it (Alright)
Gassed up, that's how we gеt gassed
I wanna see the fire ignitеd, yo
