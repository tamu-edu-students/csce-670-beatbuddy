One day I know I'll feel home again
Born again, born again
One day I know I'll feel strong again
I left my head
Many times I've been told
All this talk will make you old
So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving on

Lost again, lost again
One day I know our paths will cross again
Smile again, smile again
One day I hope to make you smile again
I won't hide

Many times I've been told
Speak your mind, just be bold

So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes

Then I feel no fear
Then I'd feel no way
My paths will remain straight

Home again, home again
One day I know I'll feel home again
Born again, born again
One day I know I'll feel strong again

I left my head
Many times I've been told
All this talk will make you old

So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving on6Embed
