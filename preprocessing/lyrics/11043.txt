3 ContributorsDive Deep (Hushed) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I don't wanna stay up
Out here on your fire escape
But you won't let me go
Ice Age is on your stereo

[Pre-Chorus]
We started a fuse
Started a tidal wave with a spark
And I don't know you
So, are you stickin' around
Or you just passin' through?

[Chorus]
This is my heart
Dive deep
You have somethin' that I wanna keep
We get carried away
Don't stop
I've got nothin' but time
So, come down when you wanna start

[Verse 2]
And when I disappeared
New York felt wrong without you, dear
My future's in your laugh
Your colors in my photograph

We started a fuse
Started a tidal wave with a spark
And I don't know you
But you're what I want and that's all
You're what I want

[Chorus]
This is my heart
Dive deep
You have somethin' that I wanna keep
We get carried away
Don't stop
I've got nothin' but time
So come down when you wanna start (When you comin' down)
(Come down when you wanna start)

[Bridge]
And I wanna be honest
When it hurts to be honest
And I'm hoping you start
To let me into your heart
Then we'll write on the wall
You're what I want and that's all
You're what I want and that's all
You're what I want
[Chorus]
This is my heart
Dive deep
You have somethin' that I wanna keep
We get carried away
Don't stop
I've got nothin' but time
So come down when you wanna start
Come down when you wanna start

[Outro]
This is my heart
Dive deep
This is my heart
Dive deepEmbed
