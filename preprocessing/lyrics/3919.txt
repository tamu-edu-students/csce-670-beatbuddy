26 ContributorsRemember Me Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
Please, allow me to show you something

[Verse 1]
Wrote you a letter
Now that I’m here without you
Hope that you’re better
Hope that you found someone new

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm getting older
Know that I've changed
And I can't go back now
Nothing's the same
But I won't forget how
You called my name
When I was afraid
And now I'm afraid

[Chorus]
Will you remember me
Will you remember the way that I was
Will you remember me
Will you remember the way that you felt when you're next to me

[Post-Chorus]
Will you remember
Do you remember me
Do you remember
Will you remember me

Last summer
We made plans like we would always be
We said by now that we'd have everything and more
I never thought that we'd be dreaming on our own

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm getting older
Know that I've changed
And I can't go back now
Nothing's the same
But I won't forget how
You called my name
When I was afraid
And now I'm afraid

[Chorus]
Will you remember me
Will you remember the way that I was
Will you remember me
Will you remember the way that you felt when you're next to me

[Post-Chorus]
Will you remember
Do you remember me
Do you remember
Will you remember me
[Outro]
Will you remember
Do you remember me
Will you remember
Do you remember me (mmm)
