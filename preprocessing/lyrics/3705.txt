28 ContributorsPoison Lyrics[Verse 1]
I could have beer for breakfast
My sanity for lunch
Trying to get over how bad I want you so much
Innocence for dinner
Pour something in my cup
Anything and everything just to fill me up

[Pre-Chorus]
But nothing ever gets me high like this

[Chorus]
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing could kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm heading straight for the edge
I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you

[Verse 2]
I can feel your whisper
And layin' on the floor
I try to stop, but I keep on coming back for more
I'm a lightweight, and I know it
'Cause after the first time
I was fallin', fallin' down

But nothing ever gets me high like this

[Chorus]
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing could kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm heading straight for the edge
I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
Fallin' deep, I can't sleep tonight (Tonight)
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind (Mind)
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in (It's alright, it's alright)
Fallin' deep, I can't sleep tonight (It's alright, it's alright)
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind (Mind)
Oh, but it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But nothing ever gets me high like this

[Chorus]
I pick my poison and it's you (You)
Nothing could kill me like you do (Kill me like you do)
You're going straight to my head (You're going, I'm going)
And I'm heading straight for the edge
(I'm heading straight for the edge)
I pick my poison and it's you (And it's you)
(Oh, and it's you, oh, yeah)
I pick my poison and it's you (And it's you, and it's you)
(Yeah, yeah) It's you, oh
(Yeah) You, oh
[Outro]
I pick my poison and it's you23Embed
