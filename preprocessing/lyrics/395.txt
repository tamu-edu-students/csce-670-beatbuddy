You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I’m wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin’ friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 2]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin’ sad
So don’t waste the time I don't have
And don’t try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you ’cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)You might also like19Embed
