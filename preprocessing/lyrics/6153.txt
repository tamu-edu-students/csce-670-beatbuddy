I love makin' you believe what you get is what you see
But I'm so fake happy, I feel so fake happy
And I bet everybody here is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy and I know fake happy

[Verse 1]
See, I been doin' a good job of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright, better hope I don't blink
You see, it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
I bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

[Chorus]
Oh, please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend, oh, no
Oh, what's the use?
Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

[Verse 2]
And if I go out tonight, dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See, I'm gonna draw my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low, they'll never see me frown
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
I bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

[Chorus]
Oh, please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend, oh, no
Oh, oh, what's the use?
Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

[Bridge]
I know I said that I was doin' good
And that I'm happy now (Ooh)
I shoulda known when things were goin' good
That's when I'd get knocked down
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba

[Chorus]
Oh, please, just don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend, oh, no (Oh, no)
Oh, what's the use?
Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, please) Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
(Oh, please) Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba

[Outro]
