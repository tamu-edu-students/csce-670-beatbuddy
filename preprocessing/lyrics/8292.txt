The paintings on the wall, they keep haunting me
I wish I could recall what you've done to me
My feelings won't resolve till you talk to me
And I'm certain that you'll call, but I'm too naive

[Pre-Chorus: Marco Luka]
Sometimes I feel alone
Hide in my secrets you need to know
I cannot feel no more
All of my demons with me at home

[Chorus: Manas]
I saw your face in the water
I can't replace what we started, I did
Everything that you could've wanted
Everything's better when you're honest
Out in public to keep me up
I don't like what I'm dreaming of
Things wе're taking don't give enough
I'm tirеd of hating what I've become

[Verse 2: Tanu]
It's hard to deal with everything I'm ignoring
And to be real I probably won't even show it
I don't know why I wake up every morning
You don't know why you're with me in the moment
You might also like[Verse 3: Marco Luka]
But please don't go away
I'll believe it all, every word you say
I can't take the fall, I need you to blame
You've been in my thoughts, running through my brain

[Pre-Chorus: Marco Luka]
Sometimes I feel alone
Hide in my secrets, you need to know
I cannot feel no more
All of my demons with me at home

[Chorus: Manas]
I saw your face in the water
I can't replace what we started, I did
Everything that you could've wanted
Everything's better when you're honest
Out in public to keep me up
I don't like what I'm dreaming of
Things we're taking don't give enough
I'm tired of hating what I've become

[Outro: Tanu]
Baby, honestly
I think that I would rather sleep
I never wanna show
The way that I can bleed2Embed
