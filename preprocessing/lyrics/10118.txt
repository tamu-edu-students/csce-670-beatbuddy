5 ContributorsOne Night Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
I thought I knew where love was
I thought I left it in the past
Just like a sunset fading
Can't make the good things last

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, maybe that was meant to be 'cause
You, you were worth the wait

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been searching for something
Didn't know I would find it here
When I thought I had nothing
You were just one night away
I've been searching for something
Didn't know I would find it here
When I couldn't see it coming
You were just one night away

[Drop]
One night away
One night away
One night away
One night away
You were just one night away
One night away

Is it the stars aligning
Together in this time and place
We watched the sunset fading
I'm dreaming wide awake

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, maybe that was meant to be 'cause
You, you were worth the wait

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been searching for something
Didn't know I would find it here
When I thought I had nothing
You were just one night away
I've been searching for something
Didn't know I would find it here
When I couldn't see it coming
You were just one night away
One night away
One night away
One night away
You were just one night away

[Drop]
One night away
One night away
You were just one night away
[Outro]
I've been searching for something
Didn't know I would find it here
When I couldn't see it coming
You were just one night away
