2 ContributorsOut of My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Remember the night that we met
Back at that party you sat on the bed
You said I'm talented you said I'm next
My only talent is making you stressed
I know that I'm not at my best
Lately I'm feeling like less
I hope that I see you again
If I don't then I'll lay it to rest

[Bridge]
It's crazy how it goes
Left me all alone
I've been tryna move on
All I find are hoes
Searching for a pot of gold
Don't know if I'll ever know
How she left me with no damn place to go

[Chorus]
I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me
I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me

Spеnt 5 months at your crib
And I ain't pay no rent
We should of just been friends
Causе I know that you never meant
All the things that you said to me
Froze my heart in uncertainty
Go ahead hit the club or some
Make sure that you drunk as fuck
Find you another man to love
Ima show you what you lost
Ima show you how it feels to realize
Everything you ever knew
And everything you ever had in love is gone

[Chorus]
I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me
I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me

[Verse 3]
I guess this shit for real
And if I had another chance
I don't know if I'd take that bet against you with another man
And if I ever saw your face
Then I would probably take a glance
But I would never bat an eye
Because you hate me that's a fact
I think this is an epiphany
I don't think you really listening
One day you're gonna be missing me
I swear to god we'll never be frienemies
Bitches trying to be friends with me
I think they stealing my energy
In my DM's and they tempting me
I know that you really resenting me now
[Chorus]
I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me
I'm okay, I'll be fine
I'm just out of my mind
Long nights, with no sleep
Thinking about you and me7Embed
