8 ContributorsLove You From a Distance Lyrics[Verse 1]
I could never say we could go back and be how we used to
But every time I think back to late summer in July, I still miss you
And now our families don't even say a word
I used to come over every Friday after work
But that was before all the pain you caused me
And all the lies you told, it's haunting

[Chorus]
I still see your face when I go to sleep
I'll always love you, will you always love me?
I hate that all these memories are so persistent and now I know
(I know, I know)
I know how hard it is to move on with my life
Whеn all of these daydreams comе back to me at night
I hate that it'll take time to forget this, and now I know
It's better to love you from a distance
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah)
To love you from a distance
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 2]
Remember when I'd drive you home, 'cause you didn't have your license
We were windows down cruising, thinking, "Damn I really like him"
And then I went out and got a new car
So it didn't break down when we would drive too far
But that was before all the rain started falling
And summer turned into autumn

I still see your face when I go to sleep
I'll always love you, will you always love me?
I hate that all these memories are so persistent and now I know
(I know, I know)
I know how hard it is to move on with my life
When all of these daydreams come back to me at night
I hate that it'll take time to forget this, and now I know
It's better to love you from a distance
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah)
To love you from a distance
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah)

[Bridge]
I hate that I still miss you
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah)
I wish I could forget you
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah)
I hate that I still miss you
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah)
I wish I could forget you
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah)

[Chorus]
I still see your face when I go to sleep
I'll always love you, will you always love me?
I hate that all these memories are so persistent but now I know
I know how hard it is to move on with my life
When all of these daydreams come back to me at night
I hate that it'll take time to forget this, but now I know
It's better to love you from a distance
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah)
To love you from a distance
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah)Embed
