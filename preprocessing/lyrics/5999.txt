The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all

[Chorus 1]
Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises, I wonder did you love me at all?

[Verse 2]
The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark
Signs and wonders: water stain riding the wall
Daniel’s message; blood of the moon on us all

[Chorus 2]
Do I care if I despise this? Nothing else matters, I know
In a veil of great disguises; how do I live with your ghost?

[Bridge]
Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you, somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you, somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow
You might also like[Verse 3]
The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, God’s grace, nothing else left to impart

[Chorus 3]
Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises; hold to my head till I drown
Should I tear my eyes out now, before I see too much?
Should I tear my arms out now? I wanna feel your touch

[Outro]
Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you, somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you, somehow38Embed
