1 ContributorSo What Lyrics[Verse 1]
Losing signal, losing people
Soon be single if I keep up with this guise, with this guise
Drinking bottle after bottle
Hoping that would solve the problems
In my mind, in my mind

[Chorus]
So what? So what? So what?
We keep on falling for one thing, well
So what? So what? So what?
'Cause in the morning, we're nothing, well
So what?

[Verse 2]
I'll be dancing, taking chances
There's no time for second glances
In this room, in this room
Spending money, I'm not sorry
I just wanna move my fancy
Close to you, close to you, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
So what? So what? So what?
We keep on falling for one thing, well
So what? So what? So what?
'Cause in the morning, we're nothing, well
So what?You might also likeEmbed
