40 ContributorsBrown Eyed Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughing and a running, hey, hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall, with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Chorus]
Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da
Just like that
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da-la-te-da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Outro]
Do you remember when we used to sing
(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da)
Lyin' on the green grass
(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da-la-te-da)
Bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit
(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da-la-te-da)20Embed
