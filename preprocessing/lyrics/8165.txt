Tallulah knows
That she's not the only one I'm holding close
On the low
I get vertigo from body overdose

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me your name, and tell me your problems
I got the same
And I wanna get stuck between your teeth like cotton candy
So you'll remember me, darling

[Chorus]
I'm losing myself in you
In you, in you, in you, in you, I know
I'm losing myself in you
In you, in you, in you, in you, I know

[Verse 2]
I figured out
That the modern world is turning the wrong way 'round
There's something about
The way our bedsheets turn religion upside down

[Pre-Chorus]
So we just have sex to solve all our problems
Let's do it again
And I wanna get stuck between your teeth like cotton candy
So you'll remember me, darling

I'm losing myself in you
In you, in you, in you, in you, I know
I'm losing myself in you
In you, in you, in you, in you, I know
Leave me in the morning, although
I don't wanna be on my own
I'm losing myself in you
In you, in you, in you, in you, I know

[Chorus]
I'm losing myself in you
In you, in you, in you, in you, I know
I'm losing myself in you
In you, in you, in you, in you, I know
Leave me in the morning, although
I don't wanna be on my own
I'm losing myself in you
In you, in you, in you, in you, I know6Embed
