19 ContributorsCheck My Brain Lyrics[Verse 1]
And so I found myself
In the sun, oh, yeah...
A hell of a place
To end a run, oh, yeah...

[Chorus]
California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Check my brain

[Verse 2]
I walk these streets
A creep in the fog, oh, yeah...
When she sang
I answered the call, oh, yeah...

[Chorus]
California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, tears that filled my bong...
Ah, years expended gone...

[Verse 3]
I hung my guns
And put 'em away, oh, yeah...
The trick of the trade
And by the way, oh, yeah...

[Chorus]
California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, tears that filled my bong
Ah, years expended gone

[Outro]
Ah, tears that filled my bong
Ah, years expended gone
Ah, tears that filled my bong
Ah, years expended gone
Check my brain
Check my brain
Check my brain2Embed
