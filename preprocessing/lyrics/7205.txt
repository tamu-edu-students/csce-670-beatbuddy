Far better places I can go
And nothing's permanent, nothing is there to last
How much do I keep from you when our time has passed?

Trying to chase away the night
Hoping you'd save me by daylight
'Cause in the end I'm just a tired little boy
Who's running desperate for a little bit of joy

Now just hold me fast and kind
Before I lose control, before I lose my mind
Now just hold me fast and kind
Before I lose control, before I lose my mind

I'm not myself these days, you know
Far better places I can go
And nothing's permanent, nothing is there to last
How much do I keep from you when our time has passed?

Now just hold me fast and kind
Before I lose control, before I lose my mind
Now just hold me fast and kind
Before I lose control, before I lose my mind
Now just hold me fast and kind
Before I lose control, before I lose my mind
Now just hold me fast and kind
Before I lose control, before I lose my mindSee Claptone LiveGet tickets as low as $73You might also like1Embed
