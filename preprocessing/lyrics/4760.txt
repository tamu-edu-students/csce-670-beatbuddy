6 ContributorsKentucky Waterfalls Lyrics[Verse 1: Nahte Renmus]
Last night, we had a show and we rocked it out
Crowd had hands in the air and they pockets out
Drop it out, schoolin' kids 'til they're droppin' out
Stop the room, pop balloons, bada boom, potty mouth
Motor's on, I'm the old man emoticon
Barry Bonds swing with the bat and the Mortal Kom'
Interlude by an intercom
Joe ain't average on the base and the finger palm
Palm tree silhouette, smooth, Gillette, with the groove in the fiddle fret
'Course I make the bed piddle wet
Drink a pot of coffee and I'm suckin' on a cigarette

[Verse 2: Jarv]
It's Jarv, 'tard ass bitch
Spun around town, six shooter on my hip
Point it at your fat son, mad fun, cap gun, splat some
Rat some, forty one gum, splat cum
But her cuff link's rather disgusting
Teletubby Custard belly rub busting
Mr. Bombastic-fun-bag-slappin'
Mast in a motorboat, grabbin' her back skin
Wrapped in her back spin
Rip on a Civic round town
We take and check the wheels (right there!)
Fart can man clamp down, (hot damn!)
Lil fatty got a daddy with an Addy in his hand
Buck wildin', Hairy Palm Pilot
Got some Visine for my dry eyelids
I tried riding my friend's scooter
I slipped through with a view through [Both hers?]
I chill with a chick named Becca
Becca's dad had an '06 Jetta
He was Mormon, she's fuck Mormon
Then her fat friend, Cindy, out back of the Wendy's
We be makin' the bacon
Put it in her butt while I play Clay Aiken
Land is a great band, steal my sunshine
L-A-T-E-R Fuck you!

Seventy five dollars for a [boat ?] off Craigslist
Sold it to your mother for double, the dumb bitch! (what)
Baby momma drama but no kids
Can't raise a child with you workin' at Lid's (what, what)
Call me Zack Morris, drivin' a Ford Taurus
More rust on the bitch than a Van Halen Tour bus
Or Mötley Crüe, Girls Girls Girls
Tough guy, number 1, whole wide world
Who the fuck said Jerry Curls ain't cool? (say what)
Lookin' good in the two-piece by the pool
Little kids talkin' shit, but I ain't no fool
Jackknife off the diving board (O'Doyle rules)
I'm Carmen Sandiego drivin' a Winnebago
Yo girl's butt look like she smugglin' potatoes
Hey bro, shoot me a text on a payphone
Visit my box for crack rocks and a-holes
Ayo, what up baby?
Masturbate in the back of the Old Navy
Finish up, tuck in, it's back to work
My boss would be proud, I punched out to jerk (word)
Felt so right
Me and Whoopi G on a first class flight
Eatin' Burger King by some candle light
'Cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonightEmbed
