25 ContributorsAll the Pretty Girls Lyrics[Verse 1]
All the pretty girls like Samuel
Oh he really doesn't share
Though it's more than he can handle
Life is anything but fair, life is anything but fair

[Verse 2]
Just as soon as they turn older
He'll come and sweep them off their feet
It's only making me feel smaller
All the hidden love beneath

[Chorus]
So won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

[Bridge]
All alone, alone again
No one lends a helping hand
I have waited, I have waited
Takes a toll, one's foolish pride
How long before I see the light
I have waited, I have waited for you to lay me down

Sail on by, sail on by for now
They play naked in the water
You know it's hard, heaven knows I've tried
But it just keeps getting harder

[Chorus]
So won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay

Oh won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, oh won't you lay me down
Oh won't you lay me, say won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me down

[Refrain]
Oh I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
Yeah I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
Oh I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
Oh I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you

[Outro]
For you to lay me
Won't you lay me down12Embed
