Cool and Dre, this is, this is Edsclusive
The remix for the city, let's just start snappin'
Crack hit Bleek on the jack, like, "Let's make it happen!"
Oh, it's me

[Chorus: Infared & JAY-Z]
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up (It's me, uh-huh)
All the way up (It's me, uh-huh)
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Bridge: French Montana & Infared]
Shorty, what you want? Shorty, what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't never leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 V's (Skrr!)
Got bottles, got weed, got molly (Molly!) (I'm all the way up)
I'm all the way up
Shorty, what you want? I got what you need
Shorty, what you want? I got what you need
Shorty, what you want? I got what you need

[Chorus: Infared & JAY-Z]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
Turn me all the way up, Dre!

You know you made it when the fact your marriage made it is worth millions
Lemonade is a popular drink and it still is (woo!)
Survival of the littest
Niggas who really up vers' niggas up in your business
I'm in the room where real niggas not allowed (woo!)
I'm the only one in the room that they fear right now (woo!)
I think they're clear right now
Let's celebrate, no red Champagne, we don't play that
All we see is gold bottles and paper plane hats
21 Grammys that I use for D'USSÉ cups
I'm on the penthouse floor, call your way up
The OG's say, "HOV, how high is high enough?"
I said, "Till we eye and eye with the higher-ups"
Until we let 'em know, we ain't those niggas
Until our babies showered in gold, nigga
Blue lookin' like Pac in the tub
David LaChapelle levels of not givin' a fuck
Prince left his masters where they safe and sound
We never gonna let the elevator take us down, aaaahhh!

[Chorus: Infared & Fat Joe]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Yo, Pecas! What up, homie?
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
This wasn't me, this was God's doing
And this time I won't finger roll; Pat Ewing
They ain't wanna see the Squad and the Roc
Now they chasin' the Wraith, like Mister Softee's on the block
Stars on the roof got her feelin' like Venus
Gettin' so much brain now I'm a Don CartaGenius
Ever since Pun been gone, been independent
So I went and threw the Pun Jumpman up in the pendant
Ha! I flooded out all the Christ's
Out in Paris, I learned what real ice is
Hee-shee, I'm kickin' flava' in your ear
I just had a gray on my face and it disappeared
I just dropped the biggest of checks, and the shit cleared
When everybody counted us out just this year
Uh, I'm Steph Curry in the clutch
Take a shot of this Royal Elite, and go all the way up!

[Chorus: Infared]
All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
[Verse 3: Remy Ma]
My swag, my flow, I stole it back
They mad, too bad, my shows is packed
My town, my crown, I really rap
I'm home, my throne, I spoil you that
When the bitch was gone, they was really playin' with it
I was sittin' listenin', like, "They ain't even sayin' shit!"
Now the real is back, I see they all tryna change and shit
But it's really too late now, I'm goin' back (Go!)
One of these bitches, two of these bitches gotta die
Three of these bitches, four of these bitches gonna cry
Five of these bitches poppin' pills, they high
Six bird bitches, none of them get fly
See, I don't wanna hear about your records and big numbers
‘Cause I was up top seven winters and six summers
Cuffed, all in that bus, locked me all the way down
Now I'm all the way up

[Chorus: Infared]
All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Bridge: French Montana & Infared]
Shorty, what you want? Shorty, what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't never leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 V's (Skrr!)
Got bottles, got weed, got molly (Molly!) (I'm all the way up)
I'm all the way up
Shorty, what you want? I got what you need
Shorty, what you want? I got what you need
Shorty, what you want? I got what you need

[Chorus: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up24Embed
