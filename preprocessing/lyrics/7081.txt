They try to hold me back to hide the fact that I'm a threat
My mind the truth behind the lies and I define what they regret
In fact, the matter is it isn't yet a promise 'til it's kept
And honestly, we'll see the past repeat itself until the end

[Chorus]
They try to hold me back to hide the fact that I'm a threat
My mind the truth behind the lies and I define what they regret
In fact, the matter is it isn't yet a promise 'til it's kept
And honestly, we'll see the past repeat itself until the end

[Verse]
I'm meant to be the one to fix the cycle, spinning 'til I'm dead
I'll run into the sun until it's coming back behind my head
I never knew the reason that I was alive until I bled
I know I won't be here for very long, I'm hanging by a threadYou might also like110Embed
