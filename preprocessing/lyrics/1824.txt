40 ContributorsIn My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Quiet as the city air on a summer night, after it rains
Faster than a bolt of lightning
The speed of a Japanese bullet train (Train)
And you know, it's always trying stay awake (Stay awake)
Oh, but darling, running ain't enough to escape from
The monsters in my brain (In my brain)

[Chorus]
People say I'm quiet most of the time
If only you knew what goes on in my mind, ahh
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
What goes on in my mind, ahh
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
(I'm not toxic, I swear)

[Verse 2]
2 in the mornin', I'm lyin' awake (Awake)
These thoughts in my brain, they come out to play (Play)
I'm replaying Gumball to keep 'em away
Deep in the silence, may end up violent
What an anomaly, what is so wrong with me? (Me)

[Chorus]
People say I'm quiet most of the time
If only you knew what goes on in my mind, ahh
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
What goes on in my mind, ahh
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
You might also like[Outro]
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
What goes on in my, what goes on in my
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
What goes on in my mind
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
What goes on in my, what goes on in my
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
What goes on in my, what goes on in my mind6Embed
