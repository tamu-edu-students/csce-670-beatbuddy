1 ContributorDon’t Leave Me This Way (with Sarah Jane Morris) LyricsDon't leave me this way
I can't survive i can't stay alive, without your love oh baby
Don't leave me this way
No I can't exist ...
I'll surely miss your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way
Ahhh, baby!
My heart is full of love and desire for you
Now com'on down and do what you gotta do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
Com'on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good lovin'
Can set me free
Don't, don't you leave me this way
No don't you understand i'm at your command
Oh baby please, please, don't leave me this way ... nooo baby
Don't leave me this way
No i can't survive
I can't stay alive without your love baby
Don't leave me this way
Ahhh, baby! my heart is full of love and desire for you
So com'on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
So com'on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good lovin'
Can set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free...
Free, free, free, free...
Can't satisfy me
Can't satisfy me
Can't satisfy me
Can't satisfy me
Can't satisfy me
Don't you leave me this way
No don't
No don't
No don't
Can't satisfy me
Can't satisfy me
Can't satisfy me
Don't leave me this way, oh baby
No I can't exist ...
I'll surely miss your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way
Ahhh, baby! my heart is full of love and desire for you
So com'on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
So com'on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good lovin'
Can set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
