I've spent way too much time moving on
Tried a couple of therapists
Even got rid of some stuff
It's like my mind got a mind of its own
'Cause I've been busy getting over
Getting over someone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not like my brain's not rushing
Every time you get too close
It's not like I can't imagine
Losing myself in your arms
It's not like my skin isn't longing
After the weight of your touch
It's what if I mess this up?

[Chorus]
So just take it slow
'Cause I'm scared to let go
And my heart is struggling
Not to get hurt again
Just take it slow

[Verse 2]
Someone left me with a broken heart
That I passed on to someone
And broke a new one apart
Things can be good enough
Still not enough
And that's why I'm terrified
Having you by my side
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's not like my brain's not rushing
Every time you get too close
It's not like I can't imagine
Losing myself in your arms
It's not like it ain't a habit
Thinking 'bout "what if" too much
Like what if I mess this up?

[Chorus]
So just take it slow
'Cause I'm scared to let go
And my heart is struggling
Not to get hurt again
Just take it slow

[Outro]
Mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
