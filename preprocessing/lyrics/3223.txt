Well I don't mind stealin' bread from the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Cornell]
But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies while the slaves are all workin'
And blood is on the table and the mouths are chokin'

[Chorus: Chris Cornell]
But I'm goin' hungry, yeah

[Verse: Eddie Vedder]
I don't mind stealin' bread from the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled, uh-uh, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Vedder]
But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies while the slaves are all workin'
And it's on the table, their mouths are chokin'

[Chorus: Eddie Vedder, Chris Cornell]
But I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry!)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry!)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry!)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry!)
