67 ContributorsFalling For U Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was hanging with you and then I realized
I didn't think it was true, I was surprised
When I found out I'd fallen for you (Da-da)
I didn't wanna believe my feelings for you
I didn't wanna believe that I could lose you
If I told you just how I felt

[Verse 2]
But I can't help it, I'm falling for you
And I can't quit it 'cause I'm stuck on you
And it might be pathetic and you might be skeptical
But I just want to be with you
Please tell me, boy, can you get a clue or come through?
'Cause I just want to be with you

[Bridge]
I'm scared
Of telling you how I feel
Maybe it's better
If I just try to conceal the truth
For me and for you

[Outro]
But I'm still stuck on you
I, I, I'm still falling for you (For you)
For you
Mm, mm
Mm, mm-mm, mmYou might also like42Embed
