2 ContributorsEnd of The Day LyricsINTRO
1,2 3

CHORUS
And at the end of the day
Don’t matter if sunshine or rain
Even the seasons change
Mornin’ will come again
And at the end of the day
I know that we’ll be okay
We won’t be problem free
But you can’t put your trust in me

VERSE 1
Rememberin', all the things you said to me
Like all of your favourite colours
And how you like your mornin’ coffee
Oh I Love the way you treat me right
And I hope I’ve been doing the same to ya
Cause what we have, Oh it’s so divine
Yea we might not be perfect
But I’ll be motivated
To keep you up when you are down
When you are down

CHORUS
And at the end of the day
Don’t matter if sunshine or rain
Even the seasons change
Mornin will come again
And at the end of the day
I know that we’ll be okay
We won’t be problem free
But you can’t put your trust in me

(Uh) Day one, I don’t even know what we was on
So in love it felt like we were drunk
Didn’t think it could go wrong (yea yea yea)
Guess that we were young (yea yea yea, yea you know)
All the things you said all the things you did
I don’t even think you know just how hard it hit me
To know you feel that way, but I share the blame
Cause I got too caught up in my own game

CHORUS
And at the end of the day
Don’t matter if sunshine or rain
Even the seasons change
Mornin will come again
And at the end of the day
I know that we’ll be okay
We won’t be problem free
But you can’t put your trust in me1Embed
