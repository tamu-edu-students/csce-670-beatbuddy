16 ContributorsHunting High and Low Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here I am
And within the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep
And she's sweeter now than the wildest dream
Could've seen her
And I watch her slipping away
But I know I'll be

[Chorus]
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to lengths I'll go

[Verse 2]
To find her again
Upon this, my dreams are depending
Through the dark
I sense the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find
So I guess I'll be
You might also like[Chorus]
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and low
High
Do you know what it means to love you?

[Bridge]
I'm hunting high and low
And now she's telling me she's got to go away

[Chorus]
I'll always be hunting high and low
Only for you
Watch me tearing myself to pieces
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to

[Outro]
Oh, for you I'll be hunting high and low3Embed
