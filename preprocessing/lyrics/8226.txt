13 ContributorsOut of Control Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've done everything as you say
I've followed your rules without question
I thought it would help me see things clearly
But instead of helping me to see
I look around and it's like I'm blinded

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

[Chorus]
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
I don't understand what you want from me

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm spinning out of control
Try to focus but everything's twisted
And all along I thought you would be there
To let me know I'm not alone
But in fact that's exactly what I was

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
You might also like[Chorus]
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
Or all of the things you've said to me

[Bridge]
I may never know the answer
To this endless mystery
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me

[Interlude]
Is it a mystery? Is it a mystery?
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
Spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control

[Chorus]
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
Or all the things you've said to me
[Outro]
And I may never know the answer
To this endless mystery
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control1Embed
