6 ContributorsGotta Be You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like an ocean
I could drown, I'm in so deep in the open, mm
There were moments
I'd forgotten how to breathe, I was broken, oh

[Refrain]
'Cause I've been here and you've been here before
So we don't know what's going on, going on, yeah
But I'll hold on to you if you hold on to me
This time won't be giving up, giving up, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Finally, it's more than just a feeling
And you can save me from myself (Gotta be you)
Searching for the meaning
I'm loving (It's gotta be you, gotta be you, it's gotta be you, baby)

[Chorus]
You
You (It's gotta be you)
You
You (It's gotta be you, baby, you)
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
It's gotta be you, baby (You)
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you (It's gotta be you)

I surrеndered
To the hеartbreak I've been through and it's over
Now I'm mended
And I owe it all to you, new beginning, oh-oh, oh

[Refrain]
'Cause I've been here and you've been here before
So we don't know what's going on, going on, yeah
But I'll hold on to you if you hold on to me
This time won't be giving up, giving up, no (It's gotta be you, baby, you)

[Chorus]
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
It's gotta be you, baby (You)
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

[Outro]
Finally, it's more than just a feeling
And you save me from myself (Gotta be you)
Searching for the meaning
I'm loving (It's gotta be you, gotta be you, it's gotta be you, baby)1Embed
