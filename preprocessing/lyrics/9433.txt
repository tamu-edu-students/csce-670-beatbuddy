30 ContributorsFeel Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I had 'til my feet went numb
Prayin' like a fool that's been on the run
Heart's still beating, but it's not working
It's like a million-dollar phone that you just can't ring
I reached out trying to love, but I feel nothing
Yeah, my heart is numb

[Pre-Chorus]
But with you I feel again
Yeah, with you I can feel again
Yeah

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (I can feel again)

[Chorus]
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me

[Verse 2]
A long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I broke 'til my feet went numb
Praying like a fool who just shot off a gun
Heart still beating, but it's not working
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
I reached out trying to love, but I feel nothing
Oh, my heart is numb

But with you I feel again
Yeah, with you I can feel again
But with you (I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I feel again (I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)
Yeah, with you (I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I can feel again (I was a lonely soul)
Whoo!

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me

[Outro]
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
A little wiser now from what you've shown me
I feel again, feel again32Embed
