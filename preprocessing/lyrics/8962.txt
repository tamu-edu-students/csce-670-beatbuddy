7 ContributorsSweet True Lies Lyrics[Intro]
Baby, baby tell me more of your lies

[Verse 1]
Hurt and pain
Still not enough to let go
Have you felt this way?
Is there a cure to endure this deathless woe?
Will I fall and break
Or will true love prevail?
I'm on the edge

[Pre-Chorus]
How much longer
Can I hold on?

[Chorus]
Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind
Sweet true lies

[Verse 2]
Sorrow-bound
I cried all hope into exile
And the monsters prowl
Behind every window and door in my dismal mind
It's the darkest hour
Emotional self-slaughter
Of what's remained
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Faith torn asunder
But I'm burning alive

[Chorus]
Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind
Sweet true lies

[Guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Faith torn asunder
I am burning alive

[Chorus]
Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind (Whoa, oh)
Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind
Sweet true lies, yeah
Sweet true lies1Embed
