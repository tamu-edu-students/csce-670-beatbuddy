10 ContributorsSoldiers Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's time to strap our boots on
This is a perfect day to die
Wipe the blood out of our eyes
In this life, there's no surrender
There's nothing left for us to do
Find the strength to see this through

[Chorus 1]
We are the ones who will never be broken
With our final breath, we'll fight to the death
We are soldiers, we are soldiers
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh
We are soldiers

[Guitar solo 1:09-1:26]

[Verse 2]
I stand here right beside you
Tonight, we're fighting for our lives
Let me hear your battle cry
Your battle cry

[Chorus 2]
We are the ones who will never be broken
With our final breath, we'll fight to the death
We are soldiers, we are soldiers
We are the ones who will not go unspoken
No, we will not sleep
We are not sheep
We are soldiers
We are soldiers, yeah

We stand shoulder to shoulder
We stand shoulder to shoulder
We stand shoulder to shoulder
You can't erase us, you'll just have to face us
We stand shoulder to shoulder
We stand shoulder to shoulder
We stand shoulder to shoulder
You can't erase us, you'll just have to face us (Face us, us)

[Chorus 3]
We are the ones who will never be broken
With our final breath, we'll fight to the death
We are soldiers, we are soldiers
We are the ones who will not go unspoken
No, we will not sleep
We are not sheep
We are soldiers
We are soldiers, yeah

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh (We are soldiers)
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh (We are soldiers)
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh (We are soldiers)2Embed
