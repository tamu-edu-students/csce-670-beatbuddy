Been about three days and I'm comin' back
I'm about four minutes from a heart attack
And I think you make me a maniac
But you don't know, oh
Two years and we in between
But we both been here since we seventeen
Here we go, fist fight in a limousine
But they don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
And we both hope there's something
But we bo-both keep fronting
And it's a closed discussion
And I'm thinking, "Damn, if these walls could talk"

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh) Well, they'd be like
(Oh-oh-oh) "Shit is crazy, right?"
(Oh-oh-oh) "I ain't your baby no more"

[Verse 2]
Been about two weeks since you went away
I'm about halfway through a Cabernet
There I go, I'm wastin' a Saturday, sittin' at ho-home
Told my new roommate not to let you in
But you're so damn good with a bobby pin
Now you gon' play me like a violin, hittin' these notes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And we both hope there's something
But we bo-both keep fronting
And it's a closed discussion
And I'm thinking, "Damn, if these walls could talk"

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh) Well, they'd be like
(Oh-oh-oh) "Shit is crazy, right?"
(Oh-oh-oh) "I ain't your baby no more"

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh) Hey
(Oh-oh-oh) No more
(Oh-oh-oh) "I ain't your baby no more"43Embed
