My life
My life was black and white and I believed it, I believed it
My eyes
My eyes looked at the world, but couldn't see it
I couldn't see it

[Pre-Chorus]
You're like the thing that makes the universe explode
Into the colors of a world I've never known
You keep turning, keep turning my life around

[Chorus]
Violets and purples, diamonds and circles
You're my kaleidoscope
I love every minute you've got me in it
You're my kaleidoscope
Hey, la-na-na, oh-whoa
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
Hey, la-na-na, oh-whoa
You keep turning, keep turning my life around

[Verse 2]
Tonight
The stars are in your eyes and I surrender, I surrender
Tonight
Our hands against the wind; we are forever, we are forever
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It all looks better when I see it with you here
You keep turning, keep turning my life around

[Chorus]
Violets and purples, diamonds and circles
You're my kaleidoscope
I love every minute you've got me in it
You're my kaleidoscope (you're my kaleidoscope)
Hey, la-na-na, oh-whoa
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
Hey, la-na-na, oh-whoa
You keep turning, keep turning my life around

[Bridge]
I closed my eyes to the orange skies
Living all of my days the same
And you came along and you sang your song
And the whole world around me changed

[Chorus]
Violets and purples, diamonds and circles
You're my kaleidoscope
I love every minute you've got me in it
You're my kaleidoscope
Hey, la-na-na, oh-whoa
You keep turning, keep turning my life around (you're my kaleidoscope)
Hey, la-na-na, oh-whoa
You keep turning, keep turning my life around (you're my kaleidoscope)
[Outro]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, you're my kaleidoscope
(Hey, la-na-na, oh-whoa) Whoa, whoa
Whoa
You're my kaleidoscopeEmbed
