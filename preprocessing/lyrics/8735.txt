No sleep in California
'Cause the hills have eyes and they're looking for you
They're right around the corner
I've been tryna figure my life out since I fell apart

[Verse]
People act strange in the Hollywood hills
Living in fame, getting high on pills
High price tag on a lotta cheap thrills
Brand new bag, red bottom high heels
High-waist shorts, can you show me how it feels?
Cocaine, caviar, champagne, X pills
Soft kisses on your neck, you like it when I give you chills
Hollywood kills

[Chorus]
No sleep in California
'Cause the hills have eyes and they're looking for you
They're right around the corner
I've been tryna figure my life out since I fell apart
No sleep in California
'Cause the hills have eyes and they're looking for you
They're right around the corner
I've been tryna figure my life out since I fell apart
No sleep in California
'Cause the hills have eyes and they're looking for you
They're right around the corner
I've been tryna figure my life out since I fell apartYou might also like8Embed
