7 Contributors$10 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well I might get uptight
And never find the right time
And I'm sorry that I don't bother
I'm not getting old
Look! Another year has gone

[Chorus]
Throw $10 on the way home
Keep your pay low, I guess
I don't know
Throw $10 on the way home
Keep your pay low, I guess
I don't know

[Verse 2]
So just listen
'Cause they're only gonna ask you one question
"What should I buy?"
"Lord, give me a price!"

[Chorus]
Throw $10 on the way home
Keep your pay low, I guess
I don't knowYou might also likeEmbed
