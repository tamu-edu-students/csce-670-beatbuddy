57 ContributorsFantasy Lyrics[Chorus]
You should know
You can go where you wanna go
I can take you there
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me
Take my hand to your fantasy

[Verse 1]
Going through these bottles
Fucking with these models
All the way in Cali
Foot up on the throttle
I'm focused on the vision
Tryna pay tuition
For the ones I'm missing
Family is a mission
Oh, yeah
Put you on to things you thought were impossible
On and on, me and you, we unstoppable

[Chorus]
You should know
You can go where you wanna go
I can take you there
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me
Take my hand to your fantasy
You might also like[Verse 2]
Oh, in the dark, who you are is a star
I know what you're worth
What you believe is what you see
And that's what you deserve
Lift your frequencies
Baby, you could be out a magazine
Just believe
Open up your mind
Realize you divine
If you know you shine
The world will see

[Chorus]
You should know
You can go where you wanna go
I can take you there
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me
Take my hand to your fantasy

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Fantasy
Yeah, yeah
