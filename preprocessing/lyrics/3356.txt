40 ContributorsCelebrity Skin Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, make me over
I'm all I wanna be
A walking study
In demonology

[Chorus]
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you've really made it
Hey, so glad you could make it now

[Verse 2]
Oh, look at my face
My name is "Might-Have-Been"
My name is "Never Was"
My name's forgotten

[Chorus]
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you've really made it
Hey, there's only us left now

[Post-Chorus]
When I wake up in my makeup
It's too early for that dress
Wilted and faded somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh
No second billing 'cause you're a star now
Oh, Cinderella, they aren't sluts like you
Beautiful garbage, beautiful dresses
Can you stand up or will you just fall down?
You might also like[Verse 3]
You better watch out
Oh, what you wish for
It better be worth it
So much to die for

[Chorus]
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you've really made it
Hey, there's only us left now

[Post-Chorus]
When I wake up in my makeup
Have you ever felt so used up as this?
It's all so sugarless, hooker, waitress
Model, actress, oh, just go nameless
Honeysuckle, she's full of poison
She obliterated everything she kissed
Now she's fading somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh

[Outro]
You want a part of me?
Well, I'm not selling cheap
No, I'm not selling cheap5Embed
