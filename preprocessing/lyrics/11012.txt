Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

[Verse 2]
People stoppin', starin'
I can't see the faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

[Chorus]
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off of the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off of the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone
You might also like[Verse 1]
Everybody's talkin' at me
Can't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

[Outro]
And I won't let you leave my love behind
No, I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave my love behindEmbed
