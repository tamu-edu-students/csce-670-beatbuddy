15 ContributorsAugust Lyrics[Intro]
August, honey
Tasted sweeter with you
Sticky fingers
From your old residue

[Verse 1]
Do you remember?
You used to breathe so loud
Do you remember?
The taste, the sound
And it sounded so damn good
And it tasted just like it should

[Chorus]
We don't talk about it
We don't have the time
We thought love was something
We weren't meant to find
But now you're a stranger
And I'm still July
But don't you remember?
August, honey, you were mine

[Bridge]
Well, I've loved you from the start
And I've loved you from the start

We don't talk about it
We don't have the time
We thought love was something
We weren't meant to find
But now you're a stranger
And I'm still July
But don't you remember?
August, honey, you were mine

[Bridge]
Well, you were mine
And you were mine
Well, you were mine

[Chorus]
We don't talk about it
We don't have the time
We thought love was something
We weren't meant to find
But now you're a stranger
And I'm still July
But don't you remember?
August, honey, you were mine7Embed
