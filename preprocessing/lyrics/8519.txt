5 ContributorsBlack Converse Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, I found your black Converse
They made me think of us
And how we wore each other out
But maybe I am out of line
Calling you late at night
Just wanna see if you're around
I didn't think our break-up
Would make us into strangers
And there's so much I never got to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, I found your black Converse
I guess in other words
I'm really missing you right now

[Chorus]
But you look good
You look really fucking good
And I hate that you don't need me
Like the way I still need you
Wish I didn't, but I do
So it's hard to see you healing
When I'm still breaking

[Verse 2]
You always had a way with words
I'd always get so nervous I won't get it all across
Yeah, sometimes I think there's a chance
A sudden change of plans
Where we'll get back the things we lost
I didn't think it mattered
Which one is breaking better
But it pains me that you're happier than me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, here we are so I'll go first
I found your black Converse
I thought that you might want them back

[Chorus]
But you look good
You look really fucking good
And I hate that you don't need me
Like the way I still need you
Wish I didn't, but I do
So it's hard to see you healing
When I'm still breaking

[Bridge]
In my bed, at the bar
In my head, in my heart
How are you happy now
'Cause I'm still holding on
On the bus, feeling great
Why am I not okay?
How are you happy now
When I'm still breaking

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, I found your black Converse
I guess in other words
I'm really missing you right now
[Chorus]
But you look good
You look really fucking good
And I hate that you don't need me
Like the way I still need you
Wish I didn't, but I do
So it's hard to see you healing
When I'm still breaking

[Outro]
In my bed, at the bar
In my head, in my heart
How are you happy now
'Cause I'm still holding on
On the bus, feeling great
Why am I not okay?
How are you happy now
When I'm still breakingEmbed
