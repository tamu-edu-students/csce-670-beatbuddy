Damn, I heard that you and her been having problems
She likes to fight, I guess you both have that in common
Started at the top and now you at the bottom
But baby, this is none of my business

[Verse 1]
You moved on, that a wrong, been a while, baby
So did I (So did I, so did I)
Took her home to your mom
Oh, but trust me that ain't on my mind
(On my mind, on my mind, on my mind)

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I saw on my feed
She looks a little like me
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I can't help but see
It's not jealousy, no

[Chorus]
Damn, I heard that you and her been having problems
She likes to fight, I guess you both have that in common
Started at the top, and now you at the bottom
But baby, this is none of my business
Damn, I heard that you and her been having issues
I wish you the best, I hope that she can fix you
You'll be calling me the second that it hits you
But baby, this is none of my business
You might also like[Verse 2]
Does she care?
Wear her hair up?
The way that babe you always liked
(Always liked, always liked)
When you're alone, does she know
All the ways to treat your body right? (Right, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I saw on my feed
She looks a little like me
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I can't help but see
It's not jealousy, no

[Chorus]
Damn, I heard that you and her been having problems
She likes to fight, I guess you both have that in common
Started at the top, and now you at the bottom
But baby, this is none of my business
Damn, I heard that you and her been having issues
I wish you the best, I hope that she can fix you
You'll be calling me the second that it hits you
But baby, this is none of my business
[Bridge]
None of my business (no to the no, ah)
Haven't watched your story in four days
Least not today
'Cause it's none of my business
None of my business

[Chorus]
Damn, I heard that you and her been having problems
She likes to fight, I guess you both have that in common
Started at the top, and now you at the bottom
But baby, this is none of my business (Yeah)
Damn, I heard that you and her been having issues (Oh)
I wish you the best, I hope that she can fix you (You, you)
You'll be calling me the second that it hits you
But baby, this is none of my business31Embed
