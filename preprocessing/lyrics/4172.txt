[Verse: Rhys Taylor]
It's late and I'm awake, starin' at the wall
Open up my window, head floats out the door
No one else around, the shimmer takes my eye
I lift my head, blinded by the sky
Feel my weight in front, followin' the sound
Moves away so fast, fall down to the ground
I know there's more to come, jump back to my feet
Now I only see ahead of me, chasin' down the street
(Down the street, down the street, down the street, down the street, down the...)

[Bridge]

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

Gave my love to a shootin' star
But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasin'
I'm in love with a shootin' star
But she moves so fast, when she falls, then I'll be waitin'31Embed
