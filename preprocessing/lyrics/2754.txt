[Verse 1]
Wise man said, “Just walk this way
To the dawn of the light
The wind will blow into your face
As the years pass you by
Hear this voice from deep inside
It's the call of your heart
Close your eyes and you will find
Passage out of the dark“

[Chorus]
Here I am (here I am)
Will you send me an angel?
Here I am (here I am)
In the land of the morning star

[Verse 2]
Wise man said, “Just find your place
In the eye of the storm
Seek the roses along the way
Just beware of the thorns”

[Chorus]
Here I am (here I am)
Will you send me an angel?
Here I am (here I am)
In the land of the morning star
