Nobody here knocking at my door
The sound of silence, I can’t take anymore
Nobody ringing my telephone now
Oh, how I miss such a beautiful sound

[Build: Trevor Guthrie]
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the shore without your light
No, I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, without you now
This is what it feels like

[Drop: Trevor Guthrie]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Trevor Guthrie]
Nothing to hold but the memories in frames
Oh, they remind me of the battle I face
Without your love, without you I drown (Ooh, ohh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Somebody save me, I’m going down

[Build: Trevor Guthrie]
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the shore without your light
No, I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, without you now
This is what it feels like

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it down the road with one headlight

[Outro: Trevor Guthrie]
No, I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, without you now
This is what it feels like29Embed
