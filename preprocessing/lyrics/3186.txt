74 ContributorsBrain Stew Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep, but running out
As time ticks by, still I try
No rest for cross-tops in my mind

[Refrain]
On my own, here we go
[Chorus]
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room

[Refrain]
On my own, here we go

[Verse 2]
My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine, my senses dulled
Past the point of delirium

[Refrain]
On my own, here we go
See Green Day LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also like[Chorus]
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room

[Refrain]
On my own, here we go
