4 ContributorsLost Without You Lyrics[Verse 1: Fly by Midnight & Clara Mae]
I don't wanna be by myself these days
I don't wanna think about myself this way without you (Without you)
Without you
I haven't been alone since I was 18
Now there's another body where you used to be, it's not you (It's not you)
Oh, it's not you

[Pre-Chorus: Fly by Midnight & Clara Mae, Both]
I miss you when it hurts, I'm sleeping in your shirts
But seeing you would make it worse
I feel you on my skin, a part of me again
I never stopped listening
When you said

[Chorus: Fly by Midnight & Clara Mae]
Can we skip the part where we say bye-bye?
Can we still talk on the phone sometimes?
Can we skip the part when I say that I'm lost without you?
Can we be the exes that still stay friends?
Know it never works but we'll try again
Can we skip the part where we're pretending that I won't be lost without you?

[Verse 2: Clara Mae & Fly by Midnight, Both]
Whenever I'm bored, I lay down on my floor
And feel the rush of panic that you might walk through my door
But it's not you (It's not you)
Think I miss you, mmm
We used to be in touch, now we're standing back-to-back
Remember when I told you I think opposites attract?
But it's not true (It's not true)
Mmm, it's not true, no, no
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Fly by Midnight & Clara Mae, Both]
I miss you when it hurts, I'm sleeping in your shirts
But every minute's getting worse
I feel you on my skin, a part of me again
Was hoping you would understand
When I said

[Chorus: Fly by Midnight & Clara Mae]
Can we skip the part where we say bye-bye?
Can we still talk on the phone sometimes?
Can we skip the part when I say that I'm lost without you?
Can we be the exes that still stay friends?
Know it never works but we'll try again
Can we skip the part where we're pretending that I won't be lost without you?

[Outro: Both, Clara Mae, Fly by Midnight]
I'm lost without you
You're lost without me
We lost when we gave it up before the end
Baby, we should start again
I'm lost without you
You're lost without me
We lost when we gave it up before the end
Baby, we should start again
Gave it up before the end
Baby, we should start againEmbed
