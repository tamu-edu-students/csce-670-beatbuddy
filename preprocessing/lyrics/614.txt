My house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo

[Refrain]
You, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all

[Verse 2]
My acres of a land
I have achieved
It may be hard for you to
Stop and believe

[Refrain]
But for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all

[Chorus]
And give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me, then all of this will go away
You might also like[Verse 3]

I'll up and run

Oh, to you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, ooh
I'd leave it all

[Chorus]

Give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me, then all of this will go away

They fear they'll lose so much if you take my hand

Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh

Give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me, then all of this will go away
