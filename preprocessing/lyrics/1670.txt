Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet
Only when I stop to think about it

[Chorus]
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
[Verse 2]
Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Only when I stop to think about it

[Chorus]
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Only when I stop to think about you, I know
Only when you stop to think about me, do you know?

[Chorus]
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me?
I hate, you hate
I hate, you love me
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?71Embed
