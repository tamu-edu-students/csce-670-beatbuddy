Burn it all away
Burn it
Burn it all away
Burn it
Burn it all away

[Verse 1]
Bad vibrations resonate
Peace is such
Peace is such a static state
Kill your darlings, clean the slate
Learn to master everything you love to hate

[Pre-Chorus]
God damn, I can be it
Everything you love to hate
I can see it
Everything you love in flames

[Chorus]
Like napalm in the garden of Eden
Like a car bomb burning at heaven’s door
Like napalm in the garden of Eden
Like an A-bomb falling through the house of the Lord
Burn it all away

Burn it
Burn it all away
Burn it
Burn it all away

[Verse 2]
Burn the bridges, fan the flames
Scattеr the ashes
Dead is dеad, is dead to me
Fear is such a fragile place
I can be it
Everything you love to fucking hate
Hell yeah I can see it
Everything you love in flames

[Chorus]
Like napalm in the garden of Eden
Like a car bomb burning at heaven’s door
Like napalm in the garden of Eden
Like an A-bomb falling through the house of the Lord
I am inevitable
I am inevitable

[Bridge]
Burn the bridges, fan the flames
Burn it
Burn it all away
Kill your darlings, clean the slate
Burn it
Burn it all away
[Breakdown]
Burn it
Burn it all away
Burn it
Burn it all away

[Outro]
Burn the bridges, fan the flames
Burn it
Burn it all away
Kill your darlings, clean the slate
Burn it
Everything you love in flamesEmbed
