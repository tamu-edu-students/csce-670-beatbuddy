36 ContributorsBumpin’ Lyrics[Chorus: Yun Head]
Bring your friends up at the pad and we go bumpin' at the party all night (At this party all night, ayy)
Grab a friend and break it down into the beat or to the stereo, high (To the stereo, to the stereo)
Bring your friends up at the pad and we go bumpin' at the party all night (At this party all night, ayy)
Grab a friend and break it down into the beat or to the stereo, high (To the stereo)

[Post-Chorus: Yun Head]
To the stereo
Stereo, stereo, stereo, stereo, stеreo, stereo
To thе stereo, stereo, stereo, stereo, stereo, stereo, stereo, stereo, stereo

[Verse 1: MC Prophet]
Ayy, I'ma wake up, I'm about to say somethin'
Three virgins on the track, except for God, he stay sus
OnlyFans, get advanced, deductin' my paystub
Got these bands in my hands, bitch, I'm 'boutta pay Yun, ayy
I'm in a band, shit, not a band kid, you a fan, bitch
Callin' Tyler, man, we puttin' down advances
My horny ramped, Prophet planned it, I'm the man, bitch
Internet rap game, I fuckin' ran it, ayy

[Verse 2: MC Kudge & Shotgun Willy]
I gotta whole lotta bitch, no "es" though
You fuckin' with that mix of our shit and techno
No dance so let's go, my bands in escrow
A band I spent on her OnlyFans though
Didn't even need the subscription
Because she be listenin' to the MC Virgins
Yun Head, and Willy, bitch go silly
This shit is gonna put us up two milli
That's double the Wayne, double the pay, touring cities, yeah (Ayy, ayy, ayy, uh)
You might also like[Bridge: Shotgun Willy]
You been down bad and you been gettin' worse
Yun on the beat so I ain't finna curse
But you know me, man, I can't keep my word
Kick a bitch to the curb, steady curvin' a bird

[Drop: Shotgun Willy & Yun Head]
Woah, woah
Oh, there we go
Woah, woah (To the Stereo)
Oh, there we go

[Chorus: Yun Head]
Bring your friends up at the pad and we go bumpin' at the party all night (At this party all night, ayy)
Grab a friend and break it down into the beat or to the stereo, high (To the stereo, to the stereo)
Bring your friends up at the pad and we go bumpin' at the party all night (At this party all night, ayy)
Grab a friend and break it down into the beat or to the stereo, high (To the stereo, to the stereo)

[Verse 3: MC Gibby & Shotgun Willy]
It's the G-I-B-B-Y, man, I wouldn't try
Fuckin' on a bitch out in Dubai, shit is live
I keep it one hundred, just like the emoji
All these bitches try to approach me
Bitch, do not get too close to me
I-I-I-I used to work at Baskin Robbins
Five shifts every week, I forgot to clock in
Never made no money, now my album droppin'
When we drop new shit bitch, you better be coppin' (Ayy, ayy)
[Verse 4: Shotgun Willy]
Me and Gibby off the bubbly
Said if the bitch bad, she can come and fuck with me
I knew 1-2 hoes, but it's up to 3
The whole game take notes, Light Yagami, don't bother me
Met her at a Jollibee
When I took her home, she started singin' harmonies
And Kapow walk around like a pharmacy
Said Kapow walk around like a pharmacy, woo11Embed
