5 ContributorsAffection Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look up at the sky ask it why are you also afraid?
Never thought that I could describe such a lonelier place
Now there's all this space nothing can replace
Letting go of you was my one mistake
Counting every day, no I'm not okay
I just wanna say

[Chorus]
I need affection
Doesn't matter what you say
'Cause now that I don't have it
I only miss it every day
I need affection
Doesn't matter what you say
'Cause now that I don't have it
I only miss it every day

[Verse 2]
Look up at the sky ask it why are you always so far?
Never thought that I needed light just to see in the dark
Now there's all this space nothin' can rеplace
Letting go of you was my one mistakе
Counting every day, no I'm not okay
I just wanna say
You might also like[Chorus]
I need affection
Doesn't matter what you say
'Cause now that I don't have it
I only miss it every day
I need affection
Doesn't matter what you say
'Cause now that I don't have it
I only miss it every day1Embed
