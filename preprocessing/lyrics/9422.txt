15 ContributorsLovers Lyrics[Verse 1]
You told me I would never see you walk away
Said you'd never break my heart
Never leave me in the dark
I guess there's just some promises you shouldn't make
Shoulda known from the start

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in the dark
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving

[Chorus]
I'm in the dark
I can't see
Can't see it
Can't see it
Feeling my way back to you
I can't feel
Can't feel it
Can't feel it
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Reach out and show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me

I'm in the dark
Show a little loving
Shine a little on me
Show a little loving
Show a little loving

[Verse 2]
You told me I would never see you go astray
Said we'd never be apart
Never leave me in the dark
I guess there's just some promises you shouldn't make
Shoulda known from the start

[Chorus]
I'm in the dark
I can't see
Can't see it
Can't see it
Feeling my way back to you
I can't feel
Can't feel it
Can't feel it
[Chorus 2]
Reach out and show a little loving
Reach out and show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in the dark
Show a little
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Show a little loving

[Chorus]
I'm in the dark
I can't see
Can't see it
Can't see it
Feeling my way back to you
I can't feel
Can't feel it
Can't feel it

[Chorus 2]
Reach out and show a little loving
Reach out and show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
[Outro]
I'm in the dark
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Show a little loving7Embed
