4 ContributorsMUSCLE MEMORY Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Your hair's a little longer (Uh-huh)
How long will you be back in town? (Uh-huh)
Are you still drinking that Jack and water? (Uh-huh)
Why don't you let me buy you this next round?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel my heart beating faster every time you get close
I can pick you out of a lineup, baby, even with my eyes closed

[Chorus]
Oh, something I can't control comes over me
My hands know just where to be
It's muscle memory
And yeah, my body won't forget our history
We fall back so easily
It's muscle memory, uh-huh (Uh-huh)
When it comes to you and me, uh-huh (Uh-huh)
I know just what you need, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
Do you still got that Silverado? (Uh-huh)
For old time's sake, let's take a ride (Uh-huh)
Tonight is already on autopilot, baby
Let's ride the long way home tonight
That's right

Every little thing comin' out of your mouth, I like how it sounds
We've set it in motion and there ain't no slowin' it, even if we tried now

[Chorus]
Oh, something I can't control comes over me
My hands know just where to be
It's muscle memory
And yeah, my body won't forget our history
We fall back so easily
It's muscle memory, uh-huh (Uh-huh)
When it comes to you and me, uh-huh (Uh-huh)
I know just what you need, uh-huh
(Uh-huh)

[Bridge]
Knew how this was gonna end up before you said, "Hello"
So magnetic, every time we let ourselves go back down that road

[Chorus]
Oh, something I can't control comes over me
My hands know just where to be (My hands know where)
It's muscle memory (Yeah)
And yeah, my body won't forget our history (My body won't forget)
We fall back so easily (Oh, yeah)
It's muscle memory, uh-huh (Uh-huh)
When it comes to you and me, uh-huh (Uh-huh)
It's practice done perfectly, uh-huh (Uh-huh)
Yeah, I know just what you need, uh-huh (Uh-huh)
It's muscle memory, uh-huh
[Outro]
Your hair's a little longer, mm
How long will you be back in town?1Embed
