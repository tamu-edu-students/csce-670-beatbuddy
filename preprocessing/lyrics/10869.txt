(Help) I need somebody
(Help) Not just anybody
(Help) You know I need someone
(Help!)

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus: John Lennon with Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

[Chorus: John Lennon with Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
