Isn't hard, I tried
Deep inside to find you
Breathing for the life

I once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find

Breathing underwater
Isn't hard, I tried
Deep inside to find you
Breathing for the life

I once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find

I once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to find
Once tried to find, once tried to findYou might also likeEmbed
