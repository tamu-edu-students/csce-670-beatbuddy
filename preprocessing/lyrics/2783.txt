16 ContributorsSo Called Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can't laugh, can't cry, can't live, can't die
Can't do anything anymore, no
Can't love, can't breathe, can't talk, can't sleep
But I can't seem to stay awake anymore, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
What a time to be alive
Such a waste of fucking time

[Chorus]
Oh, give me something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so-called life
Oh, give me something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so-called life

[Verse 2]
Feels like I wanna jump, wanna scream, wanna run
Wanna fucking put a chainsaw through the wall, yeah
Feels like I'm livin' in a world whеre everybody's all for nonе
And none for all, yeah

Such a waste of fucking time

[Chorus]
Oh, give me something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so-called life
Oh, give me something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so-called life

[Bridge]
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
Such a waste of fucking time
Feels like I wanna jump, wanna scream, wanna run
Wanna fucking put a chainsaw through the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, give me something
Oh, give me something
[Chorus]
Oh, give me something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so-called life
Oh, give me something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
