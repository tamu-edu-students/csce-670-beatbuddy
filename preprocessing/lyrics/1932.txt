66 ContributorsPony Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off
Gotta be compatible takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off
I promise that you won't wanna get off

[Chorus]
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

[Verse 2]
Sitting here flossing
Peeping your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body, every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juices flowing down your thigh

[Chorus]
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

If we're gonna get nasty baby
First we'll show and tell
Till I reach your pony tail
Lurk all over and through you baby
Until we reach the stream
You'll be on my jockey team
(Ooooh)

[Chorus]
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
Ride it
My saddle

[Outro]
They throw the best damn party
They throw the best damn party
They throw the best damn party
They throw the best damn party
They throw the best damn party
They throw the best damn party
It's the urban up in here, A.K.A
[Spoken]
Throw the best damn party They throw the best
Damn, sick of being alone42Embed
