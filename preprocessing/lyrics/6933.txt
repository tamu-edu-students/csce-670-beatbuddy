15 ContributorsHallelujah, I Love Her So LyricsLet me tell you about a girl I know
She is my baby and she live next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She bring my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know I just love her so
She's my little woman waiting across town
Baby, I'm a little fool for you girl3Embed
