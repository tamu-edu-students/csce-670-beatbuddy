4 ContributorsToroka Lyrics[Verse 1]
I swear I thought it was over
'Til you came crashing
Into my brain
You come around needing closure
The pain and the passion
Remains the same

[Chorus]
Feel like I touched the moon
Driving down the avenue
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind
Feel like I touched the moon
Trying to find me something new
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind

[Verse 2]
Just when I thought I could manage
To keep a balance
I'm on the ground, yeah
You've always had the advantage
Of being callous
No longer bound
You might also like[Chorus]
Feel like I touched the moon
Driving down the avеnue
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To gеt you off my mind
Feel like I touched the moon
Trying to find me something new
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Feel like I touched the moon
Driving down the avenue
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind
Feel like I touched the moon
Trying to find me something new
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mindEmbed
