31 ContributorsJust Pretend Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not afraid
Of the war you've come to wage against my sins
I'm not okay
But I can try my best to just pretend

[Pre-Chorus]
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
(I have to let you go)

[Chorus]
I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you

[Verse 2]
I know the pain
That you hide behind the smile on your face
And not a day
Goes by where I don't think I feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?

I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you

[Post-Chorus]
We'll try again
When we're not so different
We will make amends
'Til then I'll just pretend

[Bridge]
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?

[Chorus]
I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you

[Post-Chorus]
We'll try again
When we're not so different
We will make amends
'Til then I'll just pretend
[Outro]
(Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning)
(Way down, would you say I'm worthy?)
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?3Embed
