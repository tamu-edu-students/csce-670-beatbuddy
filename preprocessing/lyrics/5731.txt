Ba-rah, ba-ra-rah, bum-bum, ba-da
Ba-rah, ba-ra-rah, bum-bum, ba-da

[Verse 1: Amber van Day]
Ain't lookin' for enemies, but I ain't playin' nice (Mh-mhm)
The way you testin' me and look me in the eyes (Yeah)
Want some of my own candy, I love to see you try (Mhm)
Ain't nothin' real about the way you look tonight (Huhh, aight)

[Pre-Chorus: Amber van Day]
'Cause I know in the morning you'll be wakin' up all alone
Posin' all over your story with nothin' to hold but your phone
You got it ba-a-ad all over your hea-ea-ead
Girl, you obse-e-essed, ohh-oh (Ohh-oh, ooh)

[Chorus: Amber van Day]
Think that you cool, but you ain't got a crown
Be watchin' and learnin' 'cause I show you how
Lookin' at me, like you want my man

Get yourself out of the club if you can't take the heat (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
