25 ContributorsUnforgettable Lyrics[Chorus]
Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Though near or far

[Verse 1]
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more

[Chorus]
Unforgettable
In every way
And forevermore
That's how you'll stay

[Verse 2]
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable, too

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Unforgettable
In every way
And forevermore
That's how you'll stay
You might also like[Verse 3]
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable, too8Embed
