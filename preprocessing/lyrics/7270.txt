Yeah, I do them drugs
I don't give a fuck what you think
I got blood, I got mud
I got bud, I got drank
Only do it for the pain, it be fuckin' up my brain
I don't really give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, mane, ayy (Ayy)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I do them drugs
I don't give a fuck what you think
I got blood, I got mud
I got bud, I got drank
Only do it for the pain, it be fuckin' up my brain
I don't really give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, mane, ayy

[Verse]
I fly by in a hoop, don't shoot
My group don't do that goop like I do
I tell 'em, "That's cool", I got no rules, they makin' moves like I do
I don't eat food, but I take blues and I make news like five do
Get in my room, lil' bitch, I'm rude but they can't do what I do

[Chorus]
Yeah, I do them drugs
I don't give a fuck what you think
I got blood, I got mud
I got bud, I got drank
Only do it for the pain, it be fuckin' up my brain
I don't really give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, mane, ayyYou might also like20Embed
