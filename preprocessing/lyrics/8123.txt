14 ContributorsBelievers Lyrics[Verse 1]
They said I needed something in my life
Said I was doing dumb shit all the time
'Cause broken dreams won't pay your bills at all
I heard it was the wrong things I get right
I blame it on the monsters in my mind
With stories from outside these prison walls

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause even if we're hopeless
And we know that this will hurt
Tomorrow is just a word
And they can't control

[Chorus]
Believers
Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show
We are believers
So incomplete, yet all we need
Believers
Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show

[Verse 2]
I said I wouldn't run but I'm terrified
Headed for the sun but I'm scared of heights
So you and me go falling through the dark
You told me be someone that I like
Instead of being someone in their eyes
Your battle scars make you look like a star

'Cause even if we're hopeless
And we know that this will hurt
Tomorrow is just a word
And they can't control

[Chorus]
Believers
Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show
We are believers
So incomplete, yet all we need
We are believers
Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show

[Outro]
Want you to know that (Believer)
They can't control it (Believer)
Want you to know that (Believer)
They can't control it (They can't)
Want you to know that (Believer)
They can't control it (Believer)
Want you to know that (Believer)
They can't control it
No, they can't control4Embed
