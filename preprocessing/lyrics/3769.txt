I think some words are overdue
Could we just do it over?
Can we just talk it out like friends?
Because I need your shoulder
I know we ended on the wrong terms
But I said we're past it
So why you textin' me with questions
You don't gotta ask me? Like (Hey)
"I know it's random, how you been?
Do you remember 'bout this band you said you listened to?
When we were younger, when we were softer
When we were all about each other
Hope life is treating you better, better, better"

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, what's with that?
Yo, cut the act
'Cause I don't got time for laughs
No, I do not want the past
But if you are ever in need
And God has you down on your knees
And you do not know who to be
Then go on and come home to me

[Chorus]
Because I'm here (Ooh-woah)
If you need me, I'll be here (Ooh-woah)
Right here (Ooh-woah)
Said I'm here (Ooh-woah)
If you need me, I'll be here (Ooh-woah)
Right here (Ooh-woah)
Oh

And how you likin' this new guy?
I know you always want the new life
I hope you takin' care of you like
The way you cared for me in my time (Hey)
See you got yourself some new friends
No, you don't need to go to Houston
You got me thinkin' back about then
Girl, I wonder why you textin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, what's with that?
Yo, cut the act
'Cause I don't got time for laughs
No, I do not want the past
But if you are ever in need
And God has you down on your knees
And you do not know who to be
Then go on and come home to me

[Chorus]
Because I'm here (Ooh-woah)
If you need me, I'll be here (Ooh-woah)
Right here (Ooh-woah)
Said I'm here (Ooh-woah)
If you need me, I'll be here (Ooh-woah)
Right here (Ooh-woah)
