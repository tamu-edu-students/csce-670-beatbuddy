In the middle of a gunfight
In the center of a restaurant
They say, "Come with your arms raised high"

[Verse 1: Gerard Way]
Well, they're never gonna get me
Like a bullet through a flock of doves
To wage this war against your faith in me
Your life will never be the same
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer
Say a prayer, yeah

[Chorus: Gerard Way]
Now, but I can't, and I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't, well, I can, yeah
Too much, too late, or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again

[Verse 2: Gerard Way & Bert McCracken]
They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost
My cellmate's​ a killer, they make me do push-ups in drag
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself
Am I losing myself?
Well, I miss my mom
Will they give me the chair?
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope if you dare?
Ah, nobody knows
All the trouble I've seen

Now, but I can't, and I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't, well, I can, yeah
Too much, too late, or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again

[Bridge: Gerard Way]
To your room
What they ask of you will make you want to say, "So long"
Well, I don't remember
Why remember you?

[Interlude: Bert McCracken]
Do you have the keys to the hotel?
'Cause I'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire
Fire

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro: Gerard Way]
Life is but a dream for the dead
And well I, I won't go down by myself
But I'll go down with my friends, yeah
Now, now, now, now (I can't explain)
Now, now, now, (I can't complain)
Now, now, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, haha52Embed
