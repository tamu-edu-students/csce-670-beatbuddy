69 ContributorsPeople = Shit Lyrics[Intro: Corey Taylor]
Yeah (Oh)
Yeah Wargh
Yeah Come on
Here we go again, motherfucker
Yeah

[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Come on down and see the idiot right here
Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
What's the matter with calamity anyway?
Right? Get the fuck outta my face
Understand that I can't feel anything
It isn't like I wanna sift through the decay
I feel like a wound like I got a fuckin' gun against my head
You live when I'm dead

[Interlude: Corey Taylor]
One more time, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Everybody hates me now, so fuck it
Blood's on my face and my hands
And I don't know why I'm not afraid to cry
But that's none of your business
Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it?
Spin it around so I can spit in its face
I wanna leave without a trace
'Cause I don't wanna die in this place

Yeah

[Verse 3: Corey Taylor]
It never stops, you can't be everything to everyone
Contagion, I'm sittin' at the side of Satan
What do you want from me?
They never told me the failure I was meant to be, yeah
Overdo it, don't tell me you blew it
Stop your bitchin' and fight your way through it
I'm not like you, I just fuck up
C'mon, motherfucker, everybody has to die
C'mon, motherfucker, everybody has to die

[Interlude: Corey Taylor]
I have died
Oh, people equal shit

People equal shit (I'm everything you'll never be)
People equal shit (Yeah)
