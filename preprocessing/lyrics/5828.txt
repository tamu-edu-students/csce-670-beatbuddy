8 ContributorsBaby, I Love Your Way (Live) Lyrics[Intro]
Thank you!

[Verse 1]
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly, the day turns into night
Far away from the city

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, hey

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day, hey

[Verse 2]
Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
I can see them under the pine

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, hey
You might also like[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, ooh
Wanna be with you night and day, ooh yeah

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Well, don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait

[Verse 3]
I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and gray, blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one
Out of season

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, hey

[Outro]
Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, ooh
Wanna be with you night and day
Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, ooh
Wanna be with you night and day, yeahEmbed
