Yeah (Straight up)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Wrist lookin' like it been dipped
Dipped in that, dipped in that, dipped in that
Script lookin' like it been flipped
Flippin' that, flippin' that, flippin' that (Yeah)
Pull up in that foreign, my God (Skrrt, skrrt)
Whole squad get in that, get in that
Please say it ain't true, I had to go and cop two
Hell nah, we can't fit in that

[Refrain: Travis Scott & Camila Cabello]
Wild ones, like we fresh out the cage
Showtime, baby, fresh off the stage (Yeah)

Whippin' that, whippin' that, whippin' that
Yellow and that purple on mix
Mixin' that, mixin' that, mixin' that (Yeah)
Copped my bitch from the tropics (Yeah)
You know where she sittin' at
Takin' shots, pourin' bottle after bottle after bottle
Hell no, we ain't sippin' that (Yeah)
