11 ContributorsBlack Memories LyricsPretending it'll get better
When you're not around
Finally free but I'm lying to me
Searching for the black memories
To show my heart what I need
But nothing puts me at ease
Where are you going?
Come back with my heart
Sure as the wind keeps blowing
Nothing's gonna heal these scars

Broken promises you've given me
Make me wanna live a life without words
Expectations died before birth
Trying to kill the pain before it hurts
Where are you going?
Come back with my heart
Sure as the wind keeps blowing
Nothing's gonna heal these scars

Prescribe me at ten times my weight
In a vegetable state so they lock me away
Pretending it'll get better
When you're not around
Finally free but I'm lying to me
Where are you going?
Come back with my heart
Sure as the wind keeps blowing
Nothing's gonna heal these scars
Where are you going?
Come back with my heart
Sure as the wind keeps blowing
Nothing's gonna heal these scarsYou might also like3Embed
