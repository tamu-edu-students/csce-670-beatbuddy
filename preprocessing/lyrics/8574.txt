23 ContributorsHard It All Can Be Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, don't talk 'bout it
Don't talk 'bout it, uh, uh
Don't talk 'bout it
Don't talk 'bout it
Don't talk 'bout it, yeah, yeah
Don't talk 'bout it
Papi

[Verse]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everyone seems to be out to get me
Feeling like everyone's the same
But then I guess that makes me crazy
Screaming RIP Nicole, and RIP them all
And RIP my angel, wish that she was coming home
Talking about how there would be plenty of grapes on the grapevine
I feel devastated and agitated at the same time
No ceilings, I aim high
No feelings, they ain't mine
No minutes, there ain't time
Danger, no sign
Tell me, how am I supposed to live if you ain't living, bae?
How am I supposed to change if not forgiven, bae?
Know you watching me from above, I hate for you to see
The heartaches, someone put me out my misery
When younger, told me love was in the air
Lately I just never care
All the walls are caving in
And I hate myself again
And I thought my plan would work
Got my feet up in the dirt
But I'm questioning my worth
And I need you now
You might also like[Chorus]
Better hold on, baby, you're strong
You're a soldier, yeah
They say that things change all around you
Getting older, yeah
And until like we work stay by my side
Ring your hotline
I know how hard it all can be1Embed
