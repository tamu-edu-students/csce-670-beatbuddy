Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain
Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need
Yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Sneakin' in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, "Stop playin' it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control"

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need
Yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same
[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

[Bridge]
You're in my blood, you're in my veins
You're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood, you're in my veins (Ah)
You're in my head (I blame)

[Chorus]
I'm sayin' it's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless (Ah)
You're to blame (You're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same (I'll never be the)
It's you, babe (Yeah)
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe (Yeah)
And I could try to run, but it would be useless (Ha-ah, ah)
You're to blame (Ha-ah, ah, ah)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same203Embed
