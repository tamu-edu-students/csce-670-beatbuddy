2 ContributorsNo Remedy Lyrics[Intro]
(Managed to drive all the way back home but)
(Managed to drive all the way back home but)
(Whole-time, I'm slumped over)

[Chorus]
Managed to drive all the way back home but
The whole time I'm slumped over
Surprised I ain't get pulled over
And when I got back home, I ordered delivery
But that shit ain't never come, are you kidding me?
To top it all off, my headache been killing me
Ran outta medicine so therе's no remedy for it
Managed to drivе all the way back home but
The whole time I'm slumped over
Surprised I ain't get pulled over
And when I got back home, I ordered delivery
But that shit ain't never come, are you kidding me?
To top it all off, my headache been killing me
Ran outta medicine so there's no remedy for it

[Verse]
There ain't no remedy for it
Ain't got a fix so I ignore it
I just run away so I floor it
So I just take a perc and hope I'm good in the morning
Shit, I lost myself again
Wasted more than I have ever been
Been isolated saying fuck a friend
Saying fuck a friend I don't need
I don't like to talk too much
That's probably why I'm thinking so much
To the point my head gets lost in my thoughts
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Lost in my thoughts)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Lost in my thoughts)

Managed to drive all the way back home but
The whole time I'm slumped over
Surprised I ain't get pulled over
And when I got back home, I ordered delivery
But that shit ain't never come, are you kidding me?
To top it all off, my headache been killing me
Ran outta medicine so there's no remedy for it
Managed to drive all the way back home but
The whole time I'm slumped over
Surprised I ain't get pulled over
And when I got back home, I ordered delivery
But that shit ain't never come, are you kidding me?
To top it all off, my headache been killing me
Ran outta medicine so there's no remedy for it
Managed to drive all the way back home but
The whole time I'm slumped over
Surprised I ain't get pulled over
And when I got back home, I ordered delivery
But that shit ain't never come, are you kidding me?
To top it all off, my headache been killing me
Ran outta medicine so there's no remedy for it
Managed to drive all the way back home but
The whole time I'm slumped over
Surprised I ain't get pulled over
And when I got back home, I ordered delivery
But that shit ain't never come, are you kidding me?
To top it all off, my headache been killing me
Ran outta medicine so there's no remedy for it1Embed
