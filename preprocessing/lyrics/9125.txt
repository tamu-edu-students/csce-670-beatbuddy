54 ContributorsHeart of Stone Lyrics[JANE SEYMOUR]
You've got a good heart
But I know it changes
A restless tide, untameable
You came my way
And I knew a storm could come too
You'd lift me high, or let me fall

But I took your hand
Promised I'd withstand
Any blaze you blew my way
'Cause something inside
It solidified
And I knew I'd always stay

You can build me up
You can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable
You can do your best
But I'll stand the test
You'll find that I'm unshakeable
When the fire's burnt
When the wind has blown
When the water's dried
You'll still find stone
My heart of stone
You might also likeYou say we're perfect
A perfect family
You hold us close for the world to see
And when I say you're the only one I've ever loved
I mean those words truthfully

But I know, without my son
Your love could disappear
And no, it isn't fair
But I don't care
'Cause my love will still be here

You can build me up
You can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable
You can do your best
But I'll stand the test
You'll find that I'm unshakeable
When the fire's burnt
When the wind has blown
When the water's dried
You'll still find stone
My heart of stone
Soon I'll have to go
I'll never see him grow
But I hope my son will know
He'll never be alone
'Cause like a river runs dry
And leaves its scars behind
I'll be by your side
'Cause my love is set in stone
Yeah

[QUEENS (JANE SEYMOUR)]
You can build me up
You can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)
You can do your best
But I'll stand the test (Ooh!)
You'll find that I'm unshakeable
The fire's burnt (The fire's burnt)
The wind has blown (The wind has blown)
The water's dried (The water's dried)

[JANE SEYMOUR]
You'll still find stone
My heart of stone

[QUEENS (JANE SEYMOUR)]
You can build me up
You can tear me down (Can't break me, can't break me)
You can try but I'm unbreakable (Stone)
You can do your best
But I'll stand the test (Can't break me, can't break me)
You'll find that I'm unshakeable (Stone)
The fire's burnt
The wind has blown (Can't break me)
The water's dried
[JANE SEYMOUR]
You'll still find stone
My heart of stone6Embed
