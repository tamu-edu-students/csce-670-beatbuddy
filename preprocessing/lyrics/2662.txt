The present is so unsatisfying
I wish I was materialistic
Excited for the future unfolding
Thank god I'm not realistic

[Chorus]
Heels overhead in the bedroom
You smell so good, don't need perfume
I'm a tulip, you're the spring bloom
I'd be a fool not to love you

[Verse 2]
Headed down I see green lights
Block after block nearly sunrise
Rolling my way through stop signs
Pinned down by jealous minds

[Chorus]
Heels overhead in the bedroom
You smell so good, don't need perfume
I'm a tulip, you're the spring bloom
I'd be a fool not to love you

[Outro]
Don't ever change
Stay the same
Stay the same
That's the last thing I said
To youYou might also like4Embed
