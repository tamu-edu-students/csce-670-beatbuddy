I said shorty come through
You've been drinkin' too much
All that thinkin' too sus
What you mean, you lose trust?
I ain't never thought that I could hold you back
I've been in the Hillys
It's hard to hear you talk
My TP is chilly
Catch me if you must
I've been on the cusp of a new wave
5, 5'10", feel like Lupe
I fly in, I don't do plain
'Cause I've been in a new state
Blacked out Benz, feel like Bruce Wayne
I've been losin' balance
I've been in the mountains
Lookin' at you count this
It's hard for me to count this
Let me just announce this, ayy

[Chorus]
Let it play
Ooh, let it stay
So let it play
Ooh, let it play
I'ma stay
Ooh, let it play
Let it play
Let me just announce this, ayy
Ooh, let it stay
Ooh, let it play
I'ma stay
Ooh, let it play
Let it play, oohYou might also like2Embed
