68 ContributorsLivin’ la Vida Loca Lyrics[Intro]
Little bit more vibe on the track, please

[Verse 1]
She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night

[Pre-Chorus]
She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life, but she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain (Come on)

[Chorus]
Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (Come on)
Livin' la vida loca (Come on)
She's livin' la vida loca
You might also like[Interlude]
Huh, alright

[Verse 2]
Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill

[Pre-Chorus]
She never drinks the water
Makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her
You'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane (Come on)

[Chorus]
Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (Alright)
Livin' la vida loca
She's livin' la vida loca
[Interlude]
Huh

[Pre-Chorus]
She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancin' in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life, but she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain (Come on)

[Chorus]
Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (Come on)
She's livin' la vida loca (Come on)
She's livin' la vida loca (Come on)

[Outro]
Cara, cara, cara, la vida, come on
Come on, everyone
Come on
La-la-la vida loca
La-la, la-la, la-la, la vida loca
La-la, la-la, la-la, la vi—21Embed
