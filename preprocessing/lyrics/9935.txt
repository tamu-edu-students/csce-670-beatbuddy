[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa, Rosé]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

아직 너를 못 떠나고
뭘 하고 있는 건지
언젠가는 다 끝날 걸
떠날 걸 알지만
고장 난 우릴
다시 고쳐 볼 수는 없을지
아무런 말도 넌 하지 마
마지막은 없어

[Pre-Chorus: Lisa & Rosé]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

[Chorus: Rosé, Lisa, Jennie]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
[Bridge: Dua Lipa, Jisoo, Rosé]
그게 뭐가 되었건 다 필요 없어, 너면 됐어
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
날 첨 만났던, 설레던 순간 그때처럼
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
Kiss, kiss and make up

[Chorus: Dua Lipa, Rosé, Lisa, Jennie]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

[Outro: Dua Lipa & BLACKPINK]
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up111Embed
