33 ContributorsReflections Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where have you been?
Do you know when you're coming back?
'Cause since you've been gone
I've got along but I've been sad

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to put it out for you to get
Could've, should've but you never did
Wish you wanted it a little bit
More but it's a chore for you to give

[Refrain]
Where have you been?
Do you know if you're coming back?

[Chorus]
We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Falling just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise (I see myself in you)
I see my reflection in your eyes

[Verse 2]
I know you're sick
Hoping you fix whatever's broken
Ignorant bliss
And a few sips might be the potion
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to put it out for you to get
Could've, should've but you never did
Wish you wanted in a little bit
More but it's a chore for you to give

[Refrain]
Where have you been?
Do you know if you're coming back?

[Chorus]
We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Falling just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise (I see myself in you)
I see my reflection in your eyes (Tell me you see it too)

[Bridge]
So close, so close
Yet so far away (So far)
I don't know (I don't)
How to be solo (No)
So don't go, oh, no, just stay
You and I were bright, shooting through the sky daily (Yeah)
Lighting up the night, wasn't always right, baby (Mhm)
Yeah, every time that we realign, it's crazy
And you save me
[Chorus]
We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Falling just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise (I see myself in you)
I see my reflection in your eyes (I sold my soul for you, I know you see it too)

[Outro]
Yeah, I bought the same ones too
I know you're tired, I know you tried
Just say your point of view
Yeah, sick of all the poison in me
What the hell do you want from me, babe?
Uh, I see myself in you, I see myself in you, baby
I see myself in you, alright
I sold my soul for you
Maybe you should stick with us now52Embed
