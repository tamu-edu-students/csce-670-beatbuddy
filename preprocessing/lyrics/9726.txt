6 ContributorsAll For Love Lyrics[Chorus]
'Cause if tomorrow brings something good
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love
If you want it, I know I could
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love

[Verse 1]
Try to leave, try to fight
All the things inside my mind
But we will stay together
I try to push, try to part
Try to break us from the start
But I'll be yours forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I will follow you
Through the dark, through it all
And nothing I can do
Honey, I'm set on you-ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause if tomorrow brings something good
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love
If you want it, I know I could
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'll get it out, find a way
Make you feel like you can stay
I shoulda known better
Need your touch now and then
When it all comes back again
I know, I'll know better

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I will follow you
Through the dark, through it all
Oh, there's nothing I can do
Honey, I'm set on you-ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause if tomorrow brings something good
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love
If you want it, I know I could
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love

[Outro]
All for love, oh
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love
All for love, oh
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love2Embed
