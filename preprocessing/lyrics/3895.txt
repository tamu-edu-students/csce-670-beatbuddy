1 ContributorLonely City Lyrics[Verse 1]
My head's crowded with pictures for hours
Of you and what we used to be
All those places and secrets were ours
They still find their way in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I stop, at that coffee shop
And pretend that you're waiting for me
I see your face, in every face
Every step, every block, every street

[Chorus]
It's a lonely city when the neon's bright
And you're not with me to shine your light
And the skyline's empty, nowherе to hide
It's a lonely city, it's a lonely night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Evеry night when I walk past the station
I wonder if I should just go
And get out of this town and just face it
If you're not here, this isn't home
You might also like[Chorus]
It's a lonely city when the neon's bright
And you're not with me to shine your light
And the skyline's empty, nowhere to hide
It's a lonely city, it's a lonely night

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
It's a lonely city when the neon's bright
And you're not with me to shine your light
And the skyline's empty, nowhere to hide
It's a lonely city, it's a lonely nightEmbed
