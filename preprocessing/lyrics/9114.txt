Here now, don't make a sound
Say, have you heard the news today?
One flag was taken down
To raise another in its place
A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged
No home, no life, no love
No stranger singin' in your name

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Dear God, I've sealed my fate
Runnin' through Hell, heaven can wait

[Chorus]
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

[Verse 2]
Let's say we take this town
No king or queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates
I know one wall to scale
I know a field without a name
Head on without a care
Before it's way too late

Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Oh, God, I've sealed my fate
Runnin' through Hell, heaven can wait

[Chorus]
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

[Bridge]
For every piece to fall in place
Forever gone without a trace
Your horizon takes its shape
No turnin' back, don't turn that page
Come now, I'm leavin' here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind
Is that the price you pay?
Runnin' through Hell, heaven can wait

[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight7Embed
