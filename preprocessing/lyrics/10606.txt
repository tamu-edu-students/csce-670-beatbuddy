When I'm stable long enough
I start to look around for love
See a sweet in floral print
My mind begins the arrangements
But when I start to feel that pull
Turns out I just pulled myself
She would never go with me
Were I the last girl on Earth

[Chorus]
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

[Verse 2]
Might have smoked a few in my time
But never thought it was a crime
Knew the day would surely come
When I'd chill and settle down
When I think I've found a good old-fashioned girl
Then she put me in my place
Everyone's a little queer
Oh, can't she be a little straight?

I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

[Chorus]
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one, oh
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good, oh
Pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one, oh
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth
Let me know the truth
Let me know the truth13Embed
