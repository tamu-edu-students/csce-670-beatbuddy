120 ContributorsPassin’ Me By Lyrics[Produced by J-Swift]
[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Now in my younger days, I used to sport a shag
When I went to school, I carried lunch in a bag
With a apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy, I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name, then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday, but still, I had to let her pass
[Chorus: Fatlip]
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pass—

When I dream of fairytales, I think of me and Shelly
See, she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga, but
All I could do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passin' me by

[Verse 3: Imani]
Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me, "Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop"
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass, I proved to be a better man
[Chorus: Fatlip]
She keeps on passin' me by (Passing me by)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me—

[Verse 4: Fatlip]
Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
"My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me, but I know you
Very well, now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man, then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you"
Then I signed "Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, P.S. Love Me Tender"
The letter came back three days later "Return to Sender", damn
[Chorus: Fatlip]
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pass—
[Post-Chorus]
Nevertheless, I'll say it again (Passing me by)
Nevertheless, I'll say it again
Nevertheless—
Nevertheless—
Nevertheless, I'll say it again

[Outro]
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)53Embed
