17 ContributorsBroken Boy Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
I was born on the wrong side of the train tracks
I was raised with a strap across my back
Lay me on my side or hold me up to the light, yeah
I was burned by the cold kiss of a vampire
I was bit by the whisper of a soft liar
Any good friend of yours is a good friend of mine

[Chorus]
Broken boy, how does it feel?
Broken boy, how does it feel? How does it feel?

[Verse]
Tell me why I'm forced to live in this skin
Tell me why I’m forced to live in this skin
I'm an alien, I'm just an alien, oh
Tell me why I was born to live in this skin
Tell me how I’m supposed to be forgiven
With my hand in the hive and the sun in my eyes, yeah

[Chorus]
Broken boy, how does it feel?
Broken boy, how does it feel? How does it feel?

[Pre-Chorus]
I was born on the wrong side of the train tracks
Always born on the wrong side of the train tracks
Lay me on my side or hold me up to the light, yeah
I was burned by the cold kiss of a vampire
I was promised the keys to an empire
Any good friend of yours is a good friend of mine, oh
