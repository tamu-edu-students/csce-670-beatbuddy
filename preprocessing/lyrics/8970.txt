[Starts with We Are the Crystal Gems]

If you're evil and you're on the rise
You can count on the four of us taking you down
'Cause we're good and evil never beats us
We'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas
We
Are the Crystal Gems
We'll always save the day
And if you think we can't
We'll always find a way
That's why the people of this world
Believe in
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl
And Steven!

[Instrumental]

If you could only know
What we really are
When we arrived on Earth
From out beyond your star
We were amazed to find
Your beauty and your worth
And we will protect your kind
And we will protect your Earth
And we will protect your Earth
And we will protect-

You might even like
Being together
And if you don't it won't be forever
But if it were me
I'd really wanna be
A giant woman
A giant woman
All I wanna do
Is see you turn into
A giant woman

[Switches to Be Wherever You Are]

Isn't this such
A beautiful night, whoa
We're underneath a thousand shining stars
Isn't it nice to find yourself somewhere different, whoa
Why don't you let yourself just be wherever you are

[Switches to Let Me Drive My Van Into Your Heart]

I know I'm not that tall
I know I'm not that smart
But let me drive my van into your heart
Let me drive my van into your heart
[Switches to Dear Old Dad]

There's no-one like yooouu-oo-o-oo-oo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo-ooo-o-ooo
There's no-one like yooouu-oo-o-oo-oo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo-ooo-o-ooo

[Switches to Comet]

This life in the stars is all I've ever known
Stars and stardust and infinite space is my only home

[Switches to Rose's Theme]

[Instrumental]

[Switches to Lion's Theme]

[Instrumental]

[Switches to Steven and the Crystal Gems]

Steven and the Crystal Gems
Are gonna make you smile
I accidentally created
An alternate timeline
Steven and the Crystal Gems
Come on, now, don't be shy
I learned to stay true to myself
By watching myself die
[Switches to Haven't You Noticed I'm a Star]

I can't help it if I make a scene
I'm stepping out of my hot pink limousine
I'm turning heads and I'm stopping traffic
When I pose, they scream and when I joke, they laugh, I've got a
Pair of eyes that they're getting lost in
They're hypnotized by my way of walking
I've got them dazzled like a stage magician
When I point, they look, and when I talk, they listen

[Switches to Full Disclosure]

Ooo-oo-oo-o-ooo
Ooo-oo-oo-o-ooo
Ooo-oo-oo-o-ooo
Ooo-oo-oo-o-ooo

[Switches to Jam Buds]

I'll do my best
To give this jam the sweetness it dese-e-e-erves
And I'll keep it fresh
I'm jammin' on these tasty prese-e-e-erves
Ingredients in harmony
We mix together perfectly
C'mon and share this jam with me

[Switches to Alone Together]

[Instrumental]

[Switches to Here Comes a Thought]

And oh
You're losing sight
You're losing touch
All these little things
Seem to matter so much
That they confuse you
That I might lose...

[Switches to Lapis' Flight]

[Instrumental]

[Switches to Peace and Love]

Life and death and love and birth
And peace and love on the planet Earth
Is there anything that's worth more
Than peace and love on the planet Earth, oh-whoa-oh
Come on and sing it with me
The words relate to the key (CLOD!)
If it's a pattern
If it's a pattern
Then just repeat after me

[Switches to Tower of Mistakes]

I had to use you to make me feel strong
But I don't care about that now
I see a tower built out of my mistakes
And it all comes crashing down

[Switches to On the Run]

I don't care about what all the others say
But I guess there are some things that will just never go away
I wish that I could say that there's no better place than home
But home's a place that I have never known

[Switches to Strong in the Real Way]
[Short instrumental]

I can show you how to be strong
In the real way
And I know that we can be strong
In the real way
And I want to inspire you
I want to be your rock and when I talk it lights a fire in you
And I want to inspire you
I want to be your rock and when I talk it lights a fire in you

[Switches to Do it for Her]

Deep down I know
That I’m just a human
But I know that I can
Draw my sword and fight
With my short existence
I can make a difference
I can be there for him
I can be his knight

[Switches to It’s Over Isn’t It]

... Isn’t it?
Isn’t it?
Isn’t it over?
It’s over, isnt’ it?
Isn’t it?
Isn’t it over?
You won and she chose you and she loved you and she’s gone…

[Switches to Both of You]

You both love me and I love both of you

[Switches to Something Entirely New]

Where did we go
What did we do
I think we made something
Entirely new
And it wasn’t quite me
And it wasn’t quite you
I think it was something
Entirely new
So, um
Well I just can’t stop thinking
So, um
Did you say I was different
And you hadn’t before
Of course not
When would I have ever
I’m so sorry
No, no, don’t be
And now you’re here forever
What about you
What about me
Well you’re here too
We’re here toge-

[Switches to Stronger Than You]

I am made o-o-o-o-of
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-o-ove
And it’s stronger than you
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-o-ove

[Switches to Love Like You]

I always thought
I might be bad
Now I’m sure that it’s true
'Cause I think you’re so good
And I’m nothing like you

Look at you go
I just adore you
I wish that I knew
What makes you think
I’m so special

If I could
Begin to do
Something that does right by you
I would do about anything
I would even learn how to love

When I see
The way you act
Wondering when I’m coming back
I could do about anything
I could even learn how to love
Like you

[Switches to We Are the Crystal Gems]

I will fight for the place where I’m free
To live together and exist as me
I will fight in the name of Rose Quartz
And everything that she believed in
I will fight for the world I was made in
The Earth is everything I’ve ever known
I will fight to be everything
That everybody wants us to be when I’m grown
The odds are against us
It won’t be easy but we’re not gonna do it alone
We are the Crystal Gems
We’ll always save the day
And if you think we can’t
We’ll always find a way
That’s why the people of this world
Believe in
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl (AND STEVEN!)Embed
