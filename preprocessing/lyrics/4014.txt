Girl...
(I need a Cha Cha beat, boy)

[Chorus]
Girl, pardon me, I don't mean to be rude
But I got some paper, wanna spend it on you
All I wanna do is kick it with you
Bottles on deck for you and your crew
Baby swing by, girl, you should come through
All I wanna do is kick it with you (Yeah, okay)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ooh girl, look at you, baby
Almost lookin' flyer than me
And I, I got that gold rollie
With the Benzel and Louis Vuitton on my body
And I know that shit don't impress you
So no bullshit, girl, nothin' extra
Uh, girl, I ain't even playing games
I wanna take you home, I'm just being frank, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I been fantasizing 'bout you, girl, all night
Put yo panties to the side if it's alright

Girl, pardon me, I don't mean to be rude

Bottles on deck for you and your crew
Baby swing by, girl, you should come through
All I wanna do is kick it with you
