50 ContributorsNo Buses Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lady, where has your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But when you're short of some, it's nowhere to be found
Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
"No chance, you'll get nothing from me"
But now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be, just like me

[Chorus]
Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she, you think she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

[Verse 2]
Lady, where has your love gone?
It was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand
Must you first be in demand?
How he longs for you to long for him once more
Just once more
You might also like[Chorus]
Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she, you think she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

[Bridge]
Oh, her eyes went down and cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want or the one you've lost

[Verse 3]
An ache in your soul, it's everybody's goal
To get what they can't have
That's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
But saying it won't change a thing

[Outro]
And they'll realise that it won't change a thing
Realise that it won't change a thing26Embed
