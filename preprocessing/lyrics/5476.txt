Your eyes give life a new meaning
It's like I found the North Lights
I never knew what I needed
Until I felt your hand holding mine, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You say I'm your hero
But you are the one that saved me
If I ever lost you
I'd fall to my knees

[Chorus]
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine one night without you
If something happened, don't know what I’d do
I can't imagine
I can't imagine my life without you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes give life a new meaning (Your eyes give life)
It's like I found the North Lights (It's like I found)
Oh, I never knew what I needed
Until I felt your hand holding mine, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You say I'm your hero (You say I'm your hero)
But you are the one that saved me
If I ever lost you
I'd fall to my knees
