Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, oh

[Verse 1: Idina Menzel]
I can hear you, but I won't
Some look for trouble while others don't
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers, which I wish would go away, oh

[Refrain: Idina Menzel & AURORA]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Oh-oh
Ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 2: Idina Menzel]
You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for, I fear
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls

[Pre-Chorus: Idina Menzel]
I've had my adventure, I don't need something new
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you
You might also like[Chorus: Idina Menzel]
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
[Refrain: AURORA]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 3: Idina Menzel]
What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?

[Pre-Chorus: Idina Menzel]
Every day's a little harder as I feel my power grow
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go

[Chorus: Idina Menzel]
Into the unknown?
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

[Refrain: AURORA]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
[Bridge: Idina Menzel, AURORA & Both]
Oh-oh-oh
Are you out there? Do you know me?
Can you feel me? Can you show me?
Ah-ah, ah-ah (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

[Outro: Idina Menzel & AURORA]
Where are you going? Don't leave me alone
How do I follow you (Ah)
Into the unknown? (Oh, oh)24Embed
