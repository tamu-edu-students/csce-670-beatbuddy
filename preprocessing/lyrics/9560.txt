Take everything you have in front of you
Make every movement, do it 'til ya do
You will not be hungry for long if you're working
And what would be the point if you didn't deserve it?

8 long months later I feel better
I try to decompress all the things that tend to mess me up
They always mess me up
And you were never conscious of all the good that surrounds you

Wake up to the rhythm of the city and I try to remember
Even my brothers have some trouble with each other sometimes things fall apart
It’s the way that things are
It’s the way that it is

[Verse 2]
Still, and I might, you have to suffer
You were never an example of someone who was givin’ up
You’re never givin’ up
And you had all the options, you probably needed someone around you

Even when you split me up, groovin' to the sound of the laughter
And if I listen to it closely I can still hear all the love in his heart
Every time I take a look at the skyline it makes me feel better
Cause I just miss you down here where the other people try to move on

It’s the way that things are
It’s the way that it is
