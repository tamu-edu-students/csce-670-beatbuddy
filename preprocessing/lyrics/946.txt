Ayy
My girl is bangin', she's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne-poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's, can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty

[Pre-Chorus]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh

Uh
Don't need no Tesla to impress her (Don't need no Tesla to impress her)
My girl is happy rollin' on a Vespa (There she go)
Don't need no mansion to get romancin' (Ooh, woo)
She's super fine, double wide, slow dancin' (Slow dancin')

[Pre-Chorus]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (That's right)
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top, too (Gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you (Girl, I got you)
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (Styrofoam)
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (All the way home)
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

[Bridge]
My new, clean blue jeans without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips without  the Skoal in 'em
Yeah, she probably gon' be keepin' some Victoria's Secrets
Maybe a little Maybelline but she don't need it
In the kitchen light, radio slows down
Boxed wine, then her up-do goes down
[Chorus]
Ayy
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (That's right)
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top, too (Gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (Styrofoam)
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (All the way home)
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like9Embed
