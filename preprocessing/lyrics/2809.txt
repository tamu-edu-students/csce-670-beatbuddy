Is it wrong or right? Wrong or right?
You're still on my mind, on my mind
Tell me why-y
I can't say goodbye-ye
No, I can't say goodbye-ye-ye
Bye-ye
No, I can't say goodbye-ye-ye
Bye-ye-ye

[Chorus]
Is it wrong or right? Wrong or right?
You're still on my mind, on my mind
Tell me why-y
I can't say goodbye-ye

You're still on my mind, on my mind
Tell me why-y
I can't say goodbye-ye
No, I can't say goodbye

[Verse]
Don't know if I should love you or leave you
Why won't my head or my heart align?
Don't think I understand what I'm feeling
Can you tell me

I can't say goodbye-ye
Is it wrong or right? Wrong or right?
You're still on my mind, on my mind
Tell me why-y
I can't say goodbye-ye
No, I can't say good—1Embed
