What about sunrise? What about rain?
What about all the things that you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields? Is there a time?
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine?

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

[Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
What have we've done to the world? Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields? Is there a time?
What about all the dreams that you said was yours and mine?

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?
