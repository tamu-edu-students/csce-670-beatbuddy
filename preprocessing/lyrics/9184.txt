13 ContributorsI Am Defiant Lyrics[Intro]
All my life I've barely spoken
Your words have been so broken
I've been under your hypnosis
Why did I sip that potion
I'm so done with holy ghosting
My birth it is an omen
Lay me down up in the ocean
Until you see no motion
Right now I can barely focus
I'm showing no emotion
On your knees show your devotion
My skin is black but golden
I'm not here for bragging boasting
Ain't lying I been chosen
Mind is burning, hearts exploding
This is my magnum opus

[Chorus]
Are you with me now
Said are you with me now
Ain't felt this good in a while
They want us to simmer down
Can you hear me now?
Am I going in and out?
I stop and just look around
To see if you're with me now
Tell me are you with me now
Ready to put it down
Start at the bottom
Already forgot them but they won't forget me now
You really ain't ready now
You haters just in the crowd
But still I just look around
Are you with me now
Are you with me

Step in the fire get ready to take it higher
Real nigga coming out your amplifier
Ya'll want every black man to be Richard Pryor
While these white boys fuck up and turn into Shia huh?
Cell phone became your brother
Internet replaced your mother
You leaving homies on read
It's no wonder all your friends dead
Jealousy was the center piece
So my best friends turned to enemies
Sabotage my identity
Why they wanna treat me like a kennedy
They won't effect the legacy
Protect the heart, I cut off the extremeties
I'll never be another piece in your recipe for social supremacy

[Chorus]
Are you with me now
Said are you with me now
Ain't felt this good in a while
They want us to simmer down
Can you hear me now?
Am I going in and out?
I stop and just look around
To see if you're with me now
Tell me are you with me now
Ready to put it down
Start at the bottom
Already forgot them but they won't forget me now
You really ain't ready now
You haters just in the crowd
But still I just look around
Are you with me now
Are you with me no woah
Are you with me now
Said are you with me now
Ain't felt this good in a while
They want us to simmer down
Can you hear me now?
Am I going in and out?
I stop and just look around
To see if you're with me now
Tell me are you with me now
Ready to put it down
Start at the bottom
Already forgot them but they won't forget me now
You really ain't ready now
You haters just in the crowd
But still I just look around
Are you with me now
Are you with me
[Bridge]
I feel it coming now and
It's too late to shut it down and
Over the mountain now and
Burning the valley down and
I don't know where my mind is
Don't even know what time is
Somebody stop the virus
I don't think I'll survive this
I feel it coming now
It's too late to shut it down
Over the mountain now
Burning the valley down
I don't know where my mind is
Don't even know what time is
Somebody stop the virus

[Verse 2]
Room full of bodies but nothing but silence
Yeah I'm quiet but fuck all that shyness
Go crazy turn this bitch into an asylum
You fly but we ain't looking for pilots
I'll never bow down to a tyrant his highness
Even Jack said fuck all them giants
What goes up comes down man that's basic science
Look in my iris and you'll see defiance
I'd rather not get involved with you niggas
What's the problem man I'll solve all you niggas, huh?
How you fine when your time up?
How you climb when your line stuck?
Barbershop getting lined up
Yeah your head good but your mind fucked
Super damn clear
Uber everywhere
This sound like super man is here
[Chorus]
Are you with me now
Said are you with me now
Ain't felt this good in a while
They want us to simmer down
Can you hear me now?
Am I going in and out?
I stop and just look around
To see if you're with me now
Tell me are you with me now
Ready to put it down
Start at the bottom
Already forgot them but they won't forget me now
You really ain't ready now
You haters just in the crowd
But still I just look around2Embed
