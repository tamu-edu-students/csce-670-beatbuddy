Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Just leave me for somebody else
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Just leave me for somebody else
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Just leave me for somebody else
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Just leave me for somebody else
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
She doesn't need nobody else
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
She doesn't need nobody else

[Verse]
What's your name, let me out please
You know I love you, you're my dime piece
Don't stop, baby don't please
For my enemies, don't unleash
And I'll be sitting on the throne now
As I'm dying
I'll be thinking about your face now
When I can't remember all days now
All days that we've been trying to forget about
How-
You might also like[Bridge]
Control yourself, control yourself
I can tell that you don't love nobody but yourself
So please don't put me on a shelf
I can love you, I can help you feel the way you felt
I think you wrong and you think you right
About these letters that you said you were at his house tonight
You never get me but I understand I think it's fine
I lost your number and I don't expect you hitting mine

[Chorus]
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Just leave me for somebody else
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Just leave me for somebody else
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
She doesn't need nobody else
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
She doesn't need nobody else

[Outro]
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Just leave me for somebody else
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Just leave me for somebody else16Embed
