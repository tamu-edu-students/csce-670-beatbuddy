Oh, oh, oh

[Refrain]
I know that look on your face
You comin' my way, you're comin' my way tonight
Here goes another mistake I know I'm gon' make
I know I'm gon' make tonight, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I wish I let it go, you're better off alone
'Cause I'm about to fuck it up with you
I know that look on your face
You're comin' my way, you're comin' my way tonight

[Chorus]
And I will never change
I couldn't even if I wanted to for you, oh, oh, oh
There's nothin' left to say
If I was you, if I was you
Then I would stay a thousand miles away, ayy
(A thousand miles away, ayy, yeah)

[Verse]
It's hard to give it all out (All out)
Tryna block you out but you're invading my thoughts
And you got ten fingers wrapped around my heart, uh (Uh, uh, uh)
Wish I could give you everything that you want, but I won't, no

[Chorus]
And I will never change (I will never)
I couldn't even if I wanted to for you, oh, oh, oh
There's nothin' left to say (Say)
If I was you, if I was you
Then I would stay a thousand miles away

[Bridge]
Here in your arms, (A-arms) I'm already gone
You got me wrong (Wrong, wrong) and I played along

I know that look on your face
You comin' my way, you're comin' my way tonight
Here goes another mistake I know I'm gon' make
I know I'm gon' make tonight
