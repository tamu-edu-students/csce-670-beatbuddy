12 Contributors​us Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me now
Is that the sound
Of all that we were building
Crashin' down
All around us and we never saw it comin'?

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we never make it through
Say that you give another you
Well I won't take it
Or maybe I will
'Cause you never know until you do
If I had to guess, I think it's you
So if I fake it
Would it be true?

[Chorus]
Maybe we've been
A little too caught up
In things that don’t matter
As much as we thought
Maybe we've been
A little too guarded
From things that have hurt us
A bit more than we thought
You might also like[Verse 2]
Nothing more
Than love and war
But no onе knows the differencе
All or none
Call to tell me that I'm not the one you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we never make it through
Say that you give another you
Well I won’t take it
Maybe I will
'Cause you never know until you do
If I had to guess, I think it's you
So if I fake it
Would it be true?

[Chorus]
Maybe we've been
A little too caught up
In things that don’t matter
As much as we thought
Maybe we've been
A little too guarded
From things that have hurt us
A bit more than we thought
[Outro]
Ups and downs
Goin' steady when you're not around
Go figure
Tell me now
Was that the sound of us?7Embed
