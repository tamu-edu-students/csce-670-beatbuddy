All of this discussion, talkin' about nothing
You would ever say to my face
You think your words are Gospel, but they're only trouble
I ain't got the time to waste

[Pre-Chorus: Winter, Ningning]
You need to get a life 'cause life's too short
You must be bored out your mind
You should really take that nonsense somewhere else
'Cause you've got to realize

[Chorus: All]
I'm doin' me regardless
And I don't care what you say about it
And it don't matter if you like it or not
I'm having all this fun, so why would I ever stop?
Doin' me regardless (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, I don't care what you say about it (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
And I'ma do it any way that I want
I'm having all this fun, so why would I еver stop?

[Verse 2: Giselle, Karina & Winter]
Some peoplе are so mean, all behind a phone screen
When we're tryna live our lives
Why you gotta be so vicious? Be about your business
'Stead of getting up in mine

[Bridge: Winter, Ningning]
Oh, well, it won't turn your glitter into gold
So why are you wasting your time?
Mm, you should find some better seeds to sow (Seeds to sow)
They might grow one day, but either way
