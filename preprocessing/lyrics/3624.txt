11 ContributorsLegends Are Made Lyrics[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I've got that lightnin' inside me
Son of a God
I'm like a titan that's risin'
Oh, just you watch
I'm steppin' into fate
There is no time to waste
I've got that lightnin' inside me

[Chorus]
This is how legends are made
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made

[Verse 2]
I'm crankin' up on the throttle
Victory is mine
Show you the harder the battle
The harder I fight
I've come too far to quit
Step back I'm goin' in
I'm crankin' up on the throttle

Like iron
From the fire
Gettin' stronger
This is how legends are made
Above it all
Untouchable
A new animal

[Chorus]
