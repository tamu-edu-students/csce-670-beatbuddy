65 ContributorsI Will Follow You into the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind, I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

[Chorus]
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse 2]
In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son
Fear is the heart of love," so I never went back

[Chorus]
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse 3]
You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Outro]
Then I'll follow you into the dark73Embed
