9 ContributorsTherapy Lyrics[JON]
I feel bad, that you feel bad
About me feeling bad, about you feeling bad
About what I said, about what you said
About me not being able to share a feeling

[KARESSA]
If I thought that what you thought
Was that I hadn't thought about sharing my thoughts
Then my reaction to your reaction, to my reaction
Would have been more revealing

[JON]
I was afraid that you'd be afraid
If I told you that I was afraid of intimacy
If you don't have a problem with my problem
Maybe the problem's simply co-dependency

[KARESSA]
Yes, I know, that now you know
That I didn't know, that you didn't know
That when I said, "No," I meant, "Yes, I know"
And that now I know that you knew, that I knew you adored me

[JON]
I was wrong to
You might also like[KARESSA]
Say you were wrong to

[JON]
Say I was wrong about

[KARESSA]
You being wrong

[JON]
When you rang to say that

[KARESSA]
The ring was the wrong thing to bring

[JON]
If I meant what I said
When I said, "Rings bored me"

[JON & KARESSA]
I'm not mad that you got mad when I got mad
When you said I should go drop dead

[JON]
If I were you and I'd done what I'd done
I'd do what you did
When I gave you the ring
Having said what I said
[JON, (KARESSA)]
I feel bad, that you feel bad (I feel badly)
About me feeling bad, about you feeling bad (About you)
About what I said, about what you said (Feeling badly about me)
About me not being able to share a feeling (Feeling badly about you)

I thought (If I thought that what you thought)
You thought (Was that I hadn't thought about sharing my thoughts)
I reacted shallowly (Then my reaction to your reaction, to my reaction)
When I reacted to you (Would have been more revealing)

I'm not mad, you got mad (I'm not mad that you got mad that I got mad)
Go drop dead (When you said I should go drop dead)

If I were you and I'd done what I'd done (If I were you)
I'd do what you did when I gave you the ring (But I'm not you)
Having said what I said (Said what I said)

[JON]
But now it's out in the open

[KARESSA]
Now it's off our chest

[JON & KARESSA]
Now it's 4 a.m.
And we have therapy tomorrow
It's too late to screw
So let's just get some rest4Embed
