3 ContributorsWould You Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Say hello
Don't know why but I always get too shy
Every time
You are around

[Refrain]
Tonight
I could pack all my love
Send it like the wind blows
You know
If I could fly
I’d fly to your window

[Chorus]
Would you mind it
If I'm gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my home
Would you mind it
If I’m gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my home

[Instrumental Bridge]

Tonight
I could pack all my love
Send it like the wind blows
You know
If I could fly
I'de fly to your window

[Chorus]
Would you mind it
If I'm gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my home
Would you mind it
If I'm gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my home

[Outro]
Would you mind it
If I'm gonna call you my home
Wouldn’t mind it
If I get to call you my home
Would you mind it
If I’m gonna call you my home
Wouldn't mind it
If I get to call you my homeEmbed
