Hey Mom, Dead Mom
I need a little help here
I'm prob'ly talking to myself here
But Dead Mom, I gotta ask
Are you really in the ground?
Cause I feel you all around me
Are you here, Dead Mom?
Dead Mom
Dead Mom
I'm tired of tryin' to iron out my creases
I'm a bunch of broken pieces
It was you who made me whole
Every day Dad's starin' at me
Like all, "Hurry up, get happy
Move along
Forget about your mom"

Cause Daddy's in denial
Daddy doesn't wanna feel
He wants me to smile
And clap like a performing seal
Ignored it for a while
But Daddy's lost his mind for real
You won't believe the mess that we've become
You might also likeYou're my home
My destination
And I'm your clone
Your strange creation
You held my hand
And life came easy
Now jokes don't land
And no one sees me
Nothing seems to fit
Mama, is this it?
Are you receiving?
I want something to believe in
Or I'm done

Take me where my soul can run
Or I'll be in my bedroom
Wake me when I'm twenty-one
Daddy's moving forward
Daddy didn't lose a mom
Mama won't you send a sign?
I'm running out of hope and time
A plague of mice, a lightning strike
Or drop a nuclear bomb
No more playing Daddy's game
I'll go insane if things don't change
Whatever it takes to make him say your name
