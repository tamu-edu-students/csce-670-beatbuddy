1 ContributorCandle Light Lyrics[Chorus]
Lovin' the vibe that she give
Think I'm gon' die with this bitch yuhh
Fuck her in the candle light
Look her right in the eyes
Time stops and everything's alright

[Verse 1]
Look in her eyes and I'm stuck in a trance
Fucked the first day now I'm calling her back
Granting her wish
Think I'm in love with the bitch
Swear I'm in love with the bitch
Love or lust I don't care
Calling my phone then I'm there
Love when she stayin' the night
Fuck her in the candle light yuh

[Chorus]
Lovin' the vibе that she give
Think I'm gon' die with this bitch yuhh
Fuck hеr in the candle light
Look her right in the eyes
Time stops and everything's alright

[Verse 2]
Love when she stayin' the night
Love when I'm feelin' the vibe
Love when she ride in the whip
Puttin' up with her shit
Think I could fall in love with her
Think I could mess around and fuck it up with her
Stackin' the cash with her
Getting a bag for her
She could be the thing I'm missing
Think I could fall in love with her
Think I could mess around and fuck it up with her
Stackin' the cash with her
Getting a bag for her

Lovin' the vibe that she give
Think I'm gon' die with this bitch yuhh
Fuck her in the candle light
Look her right in the eyes
Time stops and everything's alright

[Verse 3]
Said she would die for me
Swear she the girl of my dreams yuh
Look at her face and I know I'm at home
Laying in bed, I'm grabbing her throat
In love with her face, I'm in love with her soul
Think I'm in love with this girl
Swear that I'd give her the world
Swear I can't think she stuck in my head
Swear I can't sleep when she not in my bed
Love when she stayin' the night
Love when I'm feeling the vibe
Love when she ride in the whip
Puttin' up with her shit
Think I could fall in love with her
Think I could mess around and fuck it up with her
Stackin' the cash with her
Getting a bag for her
She could be the thing I'm missing
Think I could fall in love with her
Think I could mess around and fuck it up with her
Stackin' the cash with her
Getting a bag for her
[Chorus]
Lovin' the vibe that she give
Think I'm gon' die with this bitch yuhh
Fuck her in the candle light
Look her right in the eyes
Time stops and everything's alrightEmbed
