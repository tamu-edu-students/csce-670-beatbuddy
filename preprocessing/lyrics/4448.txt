56 ContributorsSo Far Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never feared for anything
Never shamed, but never free
A life that healed the broken heart with all that it could
Lived a life so endlessly
Saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal your broken heart with all that I could

[Pre-Chorus]
Will you stay?
Will you stay away forever?

[Chorus]
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say, but you're so far away

[Verse 2]
Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growin' old
It seems we're so invincible, the truth is so cold
A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then, I try to find a place in my mind

Where you can stay
You can stay away forever

[Chorus]
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say, but you're so far away

[Bridge]
Sleep tight, I'm not afraid (Not afraid)
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me (Place for me)
'Cause as soon as I'm done, I'll be on my way (On my way)
To live eternally

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains, but it's so hard to stay
When I have so much to say, and you're so far away
[Interlude]

[Outro]
I love you, you were ready
The pain is strong, and urges rise
But I'll see you when He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied
So far away
And I need you to know
So far away
And I need you to, need you to know39Embed
