Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore

[Verse 1]
We've got the right to choose, and
There ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life, this is our song
We'll fight the powers that be, just
Don't pick our destiny, 'cause
You don't know us, you don't belong

[Chorus]
Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore

[Verse 2]
Oh, you're so condescending
Your gall is never ending
We don't want anything, not a thing from you
Your life is trite and jaded
Boring and confiscated
If that's your best, your best won't do
You might also like[Refrain]
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
We're right! (Yeah!)
We're free! (Yeah!)
We'll fight! (Yeah!)
You'll see! (Yeah!)

[Chorus]
Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore
Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore
No way!

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
We're right! (Yeah!)
We're free! (Yeah!)
We'll fight! (Yeah!)
You'll see! (Yeah!)
[Chorus]
We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
We're not gonna take it (No!)
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
(Just you try and make us!)
Oh, we're not gonna take it (Come on!)
No, we ain't gonna take it
(You're all worthless and weak!)
We're not gonna take it anymore
(Now drop and give me twenty!)
Oh, we're not gonna take it (A pledge pin?!)
No, we ain't gonna take it (On your uniform!)
We're not gonna take it anymore7Embed
