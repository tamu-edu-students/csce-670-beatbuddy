18 ContributorsJust Friends Lyrics[Verse 1]
Not ready, I get it
Don’t want complications
You gotta focus on yourself
You cancel, no worries
It’s all good, no hurry
Your heart belongs to someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’m always here to keep you company, company
But I can’t help but feel it’s not enough for me

[Chorus]
Maybe I don’t wanna be just friends
See you only on the weekends
Sorry hope you understand
I like you a little too much for that
Maybe I don’t wanna be just friends
Always hearin' about your ex
Sorry, there’s no going back
I like you a little too much for that
Maybe I don’t wanna be

[Verse 2]
If I’m such a nice guy and you had a great time
Why don’t we kick it up a notch?
How about you come over, move in to me closer
And let my hands give it a shot?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I’m always here to keep you company, company
But I can’t help but feel it’s not enough for me

[Chorus]
Maybe I don’t wanna be just friends
See you only on the weekends
Sorry hope you understand
I like you a little too much for that
Maybe I don’t wanna be just friends
Always hearin' about your ex
Sorry, there’s no going back
I like you a little too much for that
Maybe I don’t wanna be

Just friends
Just friends
Just friends
Maybe I don’t
Maybe I don’t wanna be
Just friends
Just friends
Just Friends
Maybe I don’t
Maybe I don’t wanna be
[Bridge]
Not ready I get it
Don’t want complications
I just gotta say it
Maybe I don’t
Maybe I don’t
Maybe I don't

[Chorus]
Maybe I don’t wanna be just friends
See you only on the weekends
Sorry hope you understand
I like you a little too much for that
Maybe I don’t wanna be just friends
Always hearin' about your ex
Sorry, there’s no going back
I like you a little too much for that
Maybe I don’t wanna be

Just friends
Just friends
Just friends (maybe I don't wanna be)
Maybe I don’t
Maybe I don’t wanna be
Just friends (maybe I don't)
Just friends ('cause I want you, baby)
Just friends ('cause I want you, baby)
Maybe I don’t
Maybe I don’t wanna be2Embed
