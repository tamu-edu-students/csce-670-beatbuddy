31 ContributorsBorn for This Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm checking my vital signs
Drawing my battle lines, going to war again
Feeling the rhythm inside of my chest, all I need is just a pen
I know I was born for this
I know I was born for this

[Verse 2]
Don't care for the critics, my words are like physics:
A force that they can't stop
They just don't get it, I think they forget I'm not
Done 'til I'm on top
I know I was born for this
I know I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe we can write our story
I believe, I believe we can be an army (Hoo)

[Chorus]
We are the warriors who learned to love the pain
We come from different places, but have the same name
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)
We are the broken ones who chose to spark a flame
Watch as our fire rages; our hearts are never tame
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)

I've struggled for years and through all the tears
I've faced the doubts I hide
I never gave into my fears deep within cause
I heard my voice inside
I know I was born for this
I know I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
I will never lose my voice
If I cut out all the noise
I know I was born for this
I know I was born for this
I believe, I believe we can write our story
I'll believe, I'll believe we can be an army (Hoo)

[Chorus]
We are the warriors who learned to love the pain
We come from different places, but have the same name
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)
We are the broken ones who chose to spark a flame
Watch as our fire rages; our hearts are never tame
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, hoo
Oh-oh-oh, hoo
Oh-oh-oh, hoo
Oh-oh-oh, hoo
These words that I write are for someone like me
To know you're not alone
The moves that you make, yeah, they come up mistakes
Don't ever lose your hope
Just know that you were born for this
Just know you were born for this (Hoo)

[Chorus]
We are the warriors who learned to love the pain
We come from different places, but have the same name
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)
We are the broken ones who chose to spark a flame
Watch as our fire rages; our hearts are never tame
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)
