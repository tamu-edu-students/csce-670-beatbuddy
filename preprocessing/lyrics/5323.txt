Winter's city side, crystal bits of snowflakes
All around my head and in the wind
I had no illusions that I'd ever find a glimpse of
Summer's heatwave in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You did what you did to me
Now, it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight
Big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright
Pay then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
Oh, when you're big in Japan

[Verse 2]
Neon on my naked skin
Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo? Or should I go
And change my point of view for other ugly scenes?
