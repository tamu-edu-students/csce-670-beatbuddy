1 ContributorBreak My Heart Lyrics[Intro]
Darling, I would break my heart
If it was gonna make yours whole
I would rip myself apart
If it was gonna heal your soul

[Verse 1]
Woke up in a panic for a moment
Forget that you told me that you had to go
And I'm scared but I don't wanna show it
Feels like it's been weeks but it's only been days
And I'm slowly losin' all my self-control
There's only one thing I can say it's

[Pre-Chorus]
I could spend forever always lovin' ya
But if I let you go, would you be happier?

[Chorus]
Darling, I would break my heart
If it was gonna make yours whole
I would rip myself apart
If it was gonna heal your soul
I would pick up all the pieces
I don't need a million reasons
Oh, to break my heart for yours
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'll be lyin' if I said that it'd be easy
To realize that I wouldn't have you by my side
But I'd do it, if that's what you needed
I say that I could let you go
And I pray, I never have to know
You'll always be the one I love the most

[Chorus]
Darling, I would break my heart
If it was gonna make yours whole
I would rip myself apart
If it was gonna heal your soul
I would pick up all the pieces
I don't need a million reasons
Oh, to break my heart for yours

[Pre-Chorus]
I could spend forever always lovin' ya
But if I let you go, would you be happier?

[Chorus]
Darling, I would break my heart
If it was gonna make yours whole
I would rip myself apart
If it was gonna heal your soul
I would pick up all the pieces
I don't need a million reasons
Oh, to break my heart for yours, for yoursEmbed
