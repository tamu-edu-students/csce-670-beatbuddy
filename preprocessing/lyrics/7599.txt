16 ContributorsFairytale Lyrics[Verse 1]
At age of nine I lived through Pixar on a screen
And every single problem seemed so little then to me
Cause Flik still saved the anthill even though I couldn't see beyond
The kids at school that hated me and my insecurity

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I thought I was invincible
But Mr. Incredible could only take so much and
I made my heart invisible
'Cause I thought that WALL-E could still find love with an empty soul

[Chorus]
So keep me awake
Just look in my eyes
I'm trying to let go
I try to forget
The fairytale lies
But it's all that I've known

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to open up that door
Worried that the world outside wasn't my home anymore
This isn't Andy's room, these aren't the toys I used to know
What happened to the stories I was told?
Then my mother asked me
"Could you find confidence beyond Lightning McQueen?"
'Cause stories won't last once you wake from your dreams
I looked her in the eyes and asked her what it all means
If my heroes only go so far
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I thought I was invincible
But Mr. Incredible could only take so much and
I made my heart invisible
'Cause I thought that WALL-E could still find love with an empty soul

[Chorus]
So keep me awake
Just look in my eyes
I'm trying to let go
I try to forget
The fairytale lies
But it's all that I've known

[Outro]
Then my mother asked me
"Could you find confidence beyond Lightning McQueen?"
'Cause stories won't last once you wake from your dreams
I looked her in the eyes and asked her what it all means
If my heroes only go so far3Embed
