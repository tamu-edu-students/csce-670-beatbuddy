15 ContributorsMake a Move Lyrics[Intro]
Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody

[Verse 1]
Test my reality
Check if there's a weak spot
Clingin' to insanity
In hopes the world will ease up
Try to make it look like it's all somehow getting better
'Cause I know how to play it pretty good against the measure
Everyone started out a little insane
But we learn pretty quick how to fake it for the game
But some of you never learned to drop the act
So under that skin of yours: a heart attack

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got all our lives to lose
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out
I play along
Like I don't know what's going on
You might also likeSomebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on

[Verse 2]
And if I had the answers I'd have written them out
So I can tell you what to do and what this thing is about
But all I've ever learned comes second-hand
And I dare not preach what I don't understand

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I; we share the same disease
Cover up; compromise what we grieve
I've let more than my share of revivals die
This isn't pretty but it's what I am tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got all our lives to lose
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out
I play along
Like I don't know what's going on
Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on

[Bridge]
Pointing my fingers the problems still linger
They keep getting bigger and I hold the trigger
Running with fire, I live like a liar
Please somebody make a move

Somebody make a move (I'm pointing my fingers)
Somebody make a move (The problems still linger)
Somebody make a move (I'm pointing my fingers)
Somebody
Somebody make a move

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out
I play along

'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got all our lives to lose
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out
I play along
Like I don't know what's going on
Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on11Embed
