20 ContributorsWhy Georgia Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am driving up '85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

[Chorus]
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

[Verse 2]
I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Either way--I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

[Chorus]
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

[Bridge]
So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

[Verse 3]
Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Still "everything happens for a reason"
Is no reason not to ask myself
[Chorus]
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why? Tell me why?
Why? Why Georgia, why?12Embed
