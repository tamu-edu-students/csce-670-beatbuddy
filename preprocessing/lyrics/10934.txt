8 ContributorsDon’t Wanna Be Without Ya Lyrics[Verse 1]
Say, what if we reincarnate
And whatever God says, "It's your turn for choosing"
Would you rather come back, be born in a circle?
See the oldest garden, the crescent is fertile

[Verse 2]
Or would you prefer see life underwater?
Only knowing oceans, have hundreds of daughters
There's a part of hope that is sewn in this theory
Give me any species and keep yourself near me
Make it easy

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without ya, ahh-ahh
If you start over, can I redo mine, too?
Anything you become
Lemme run beside you
Go a little bit farther
So what if

[Verse 3]
I managed to mess up a sequence
And I had to come back as one of your hairpins
I know that the morning I'm born in your tresses
Would be more than worth it adorning some Goddess
Being honest
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without ya, ahh-ahh
If you start over, can I redo mine, too?
Anything you become
Lemme run beside you
Go a little bit farther
Put it on me

[Verse 4]
Every night, you shoulda died
For a better view of the moon
Back of your belt, held on tight
But I fell with you
I could see us being young lovers in a fable
That could be us, it could
Over and over, becoming, become

[Outro]

Menagerie, imagine me, babe
Menagerie, imagine me, babe
Menagerie, imagine me, babe
Menagerie, imagine me, babe
Menagerie, imagine me, babe
Menagerie, imagine me, babe
I don't wanna be without you, ahh-ahh
Menagerie, imagine me, babe
I don't wanna be without you, ahh-ahh
Menagerie, imagine me, babe
I don't wanna be without you, ahh-ahh
Menagerie, imagine me, babe4Embed
