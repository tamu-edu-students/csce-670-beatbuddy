7 Contributors​sometimes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I went back to the coffee shop, where we first met
Where I kissed you and said "I’m never leaving"
And I believed it
Never thought I would find you here
Talking again, to some guy you just met
I’m glad you're healin'
But I can't believe it, Ohhh

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause that was supposed to be us
Two kids just fallin' in love

[Chorus]
Sometimes love just isn't enough
Sometimes perfect couples break up
And I hope you the find the love you can trust
But sometimes I just wish it was us

[Verse 2]
I know it’s not fair for me to call you tonight
But it would be a lie, to say that I’m alright, Ohhh

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause that was supposed to be us
Two kids just falling in love
You might also like[Chorus]
Sometimes love just isn't enough
Sometimes perfect couples break up
And I hope you the find the love you can trust
But sometimes I just wish it was us, Ohhh

[Bridge]
I just wish it was us (Ohhhh)
I just wish it was us (Ohhhh)
And I hope you find the love you can trust
But sometimes I just wish it was us

[Outro]
I went back to the coffee shop, where we first met
I guess all stories end
This is where we leave it
I can't believe itEmbed
