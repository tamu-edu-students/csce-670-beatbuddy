Nights it was cold and Dey thought I was hidin
I ain't send em shots we took weakness for kindness
Broke as a bitch member my momma crying

In dem Nike suits juss look so finesse
Grab da foreign or we renting a jet
Major key we juss act like Da best

And pull up Wid niggas indict for stuff
Hollow tips we'll wet a nigga if he in my town like He Michael Phelps

[Verse 2: Prince Nas]
Call me Princey baby if you ain't gotta clue
Wen I'm inda booth I gotta speak da truth
Call my niggas up if its a problem too
We'll pull up bangin shooters aimin at you
Pull up to da turf and I'm like who is you
You can catch em posted onda fuckin stoop
Cops see a nigga Dey be force too shoot
And I'm Trynna swerve off ina Bentley Coupe
I be wildin boolin Wid a bunch of bangers
If he holdin tax em den we gotta change em
Crop a nigga picture take em out da frame
Cheating on yah man and I'm da one to blame
She can call my phone and ima fuckin pager
Duecey on my body like a fuckin pager
I'll give a nigga 16 shots like its summin sweet to release my anger
I don't fuck Wid niggas like I'm fuckin racist
Ak47 give dat man a face lift
I don't talk to cops won't catch me in no station
If i get locked I'm bailin out da next day
I juss try to keep it real Wid niggas
To be honest I ain't really feeling niggas
Cause a bunch of niggas Dey be plotting on you so you kno you gotta keep da steal for niggas
Couple brothers keep em inda cut
Kno for sure Dey Wid it dey gon drill for niggas
Bunch a niggas saying You should rap yah life
But if I did would you really feel a nigga
Been loadin macks and countin up dese stacks
Niggas beefing see me have a heart attack
Fuck da fame all I wanna do is rap
But niggas moving wocky boy dat shit is wack
Bad bitch pussy wet as water
If boy outta line I put em back in order
All dese beats a nigga gotta do his slaughter
I can prolly fuck a nigga moms or daughter
Catch me flaming up a blunt Wid Bro
I could stop a track or I could switch Da flow
Niggas always say Dey got da realist raps
But ona fire track be soundin like a hoe
I don't care for niggas dat be playing fake
Heat his body up and watch a nigga bake
If he food I put him ona fuckin plate
And bring em to da whooptys let em eat his face
Mob9 Bitch I'm here to stay
Stay away from niggas dat I Kant relate
Racin to dat money no I can't be late
Trynna dip and dash and get away from jakesEmbed
