Superman will never save you
Spiderman will never catch you
The Flash will never run to you
Like I would, When I was with you

[Chorus]
You know you've reaped what you have sown
You know you’re the reason you're alone
You said I was your superhero
But sometimes superheroes cannot save everyone

[Verse 2]
Iron Man will never heal you
The Hulk will never hold you
Another man will never love you
Like I did. Like I still do

[Chorus]
You know you've reaped what you have sown
You know you’re the reason you're alone
You said I was your superhero
But sometimes superheroes cannot save everyone

[Bridge]
I had to let go
And watch you fall
And I could've saved you
But you didn't want me to
So I let you go
And I watched you fall
And I could've saved you
But you didn't want me to
So I let you go
And I watched you fall
And I could've saved you
But you didn't want me to
You might also like[Chorus]
You know you’ve reaped what you have sown
You know you’re the reason you're alone
You said I was your superhero
But sometimes superheroes cannot save everyone5Embed
