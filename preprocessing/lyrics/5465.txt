65 ContributorsPour Some Sugar on Me Lyrics[Intro]
Step inside
Walk this way
You and me babe
Hey hey!

[Verse 1]
Love is like a bomb, baby, c'mon get it on
Livin' like a lover with a radar phone
Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp
Demolition woman, can I be your man?
Razzle 'n' a dazzle 'n' a flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent sugar me, yeah

[Pre Chorus]
So c'mon, take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up

[Chorus]
Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
C'mon, fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
I can't get enough

I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah

[Verse 2]
Listen! red light, yellow light, green-a-light go!
Crazy little woman in a one man show
Mirror queen, mannequine, rhythm of love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up
Lucid love
You gotta squeeze a little, squeeze a little
Tease a little more
Easy operator come a knockin' on my door
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent sugar me, yeah, yeah
Give a little more

[Pre Chorus]
Take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up

[Chorus]
Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
C'mon, fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
I can't get enough
[Post Chorus]
I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah

[Bridge]
You got the peaches, I got the cream
Sweet to taste, saccharine
Cause I'm hot, hot, so hot, sticky sweet
From my head, my head, to my feet
Do you take sugar? one lump or two?

[Pre Chorus]
Take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up

[Chorus]
Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
C'mon fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
Oh, I can't get enough

[Outro]
Pour some sugar on me
Oh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
Get it, come get it
Pour your sugar on me
Pour some sugar on me
Yeah! Sugar me!24Embed
