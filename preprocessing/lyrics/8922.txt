7 ContributorsTesselation LyricsDaddy knows just what to do
When his hand becomes a pool
In his head he ain't a fool
Pushing weight in Hollywood
My gestalt is hanging on the edge of the fault
Learning tricks from Uncle Donnie
And Walt for our education
Sloganeering on the lot
He's a nascent vagabond
Motion picture Babylon
When I'm twisted and alone
My gestalt is hanging on the edge of the fault
Learning tricks from Uncle Donnie
And Walt for a revelation
And if you thought this paradigm was out of the box
This rare design is only a block in the tesselationYou might also like2Embed
