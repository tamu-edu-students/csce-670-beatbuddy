1 ContributorWho - Lauv ft BTS - (Cover by Amy and Charlice) Lyrics[Charlice]
Outlines have new eyes and visions of you
Girl, I think I need a minute
To figure out what is, what isn't
These choices and voices, they're all in my head
Sometimes you make me feel crazy
Sometimes, I swear I think you hate me like uh

[Amy]
I need a walk, I need a walk, I need to get out of here
'Cause I need to know
Who are you?
'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with, baby
Who are you?
'Cause something has changed, you're not the same, I hate it

[Charlice}
Oh, I'm sick of waiting for love, love
Oh, I know that you're not the one, one

[Amy]
Feeling hypnotized by the words that you said
Don't lie to me, just get in my head
When the morning comes, you're still in my bed
But it's so, so cold
Who are you?
'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with
Who are you?
'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with, baby
Who are you? (Who are you?)
'Cause something has changed, you're not the same, I hate it
You might also like[Charlice]
Oh, I'm sick of waiting for love, love
Oh, I know that you're not the one, one
Sick of waiting for loveEmbed
