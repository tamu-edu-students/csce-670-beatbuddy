10 ContributorsHeart’s Content Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe you thought I hung the moon
Maybe you thought we were Johnny and June
Maybe we thought it was just us two
Maybe we spoke too soon

[Verse 2]
We never lie and we don't tell tales
We bite our tongues and our fingernails
We fall in love and we don't fall out
Maybe we speak too soon

[Chorus]
Here's to you and me, and in between
We draw a line but we can't see where it's been
We scratch our heads and race against the heart's content
Oh oh oh oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Maybe we hurt who we love the most
Maybe it's all we can stand
Maybe we walk through the world as ghosts
Break my own heart before you can

[Chorus]
Here's to you and me, and in between
We draw a line but we can't see where it's been
We scratch our heads and race against the heart's content
Oh oh oh oh yeah

Maybe we know how the story ends
Maybe it's not even about us
We both retreat to opposing stands
And the love lives on without us

[Bridge]
One thing I know for sure is
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

[Chorus]
Here's to you and me, and in between
We draw a line but we can't see where it's been
We scratch our heads and race against the heart's content
Oh oh oh oh, you and me
Oh oh oh oh, you and me
Oh oh oh oh, you and me
Oh oh oh oh yeah2Embed
