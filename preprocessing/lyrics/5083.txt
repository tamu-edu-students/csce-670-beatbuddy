9 ContributorsJudgment Day Lyrics[Intro]
La-hah, laaa-hah, la-hah, la-hah-ahhh
La-hah, laaa-hah, la-hah, la-hah-ahhh

[Verse 1]
You gotta watch for the shot
Beware the ricochet
Dance, dance, motherfucker
Till the fat bitch sings
You get one for the chamber
Two for good health
Know a little about evil
And a lot about hell

[Verse 2]
Playing ring around the daisies
With a shotgun shell
If you're gonna take a life
Better keep it to yourself
Seems every time I think
There's just a little bit of hope
Someone comes out swinging
With a deadman's rope

[Pre-Chorus]
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
Damned if I will
Damned if I won't
Doomed if I try
Doomed if I fail
Damn you all to hell

I'm no angel, I'm no savior
And I've never been a saint
Well, I know I'm not the devil
'Cause I still can feel the pain
Walk through fire and through brimstone
And there were no pearly gates
I'll be sure to ask about it
On my final Judgement Day
Judgement Day

[Verse 3]
Two tears in a bucket
One down the drain
Dance, dance, motherfucker
Till the war drums play
I know a little 'bout death
A lot about pain
I ain't ever seen a storm
That don't end in rain

[Verse 4]
Gotta pay the pied piper
Every dog will have its day
I don't stress the mess
'Cause it's all so cliché
You can run around in circles
But it always ends the same
You'll be swinging from the end
Of a deadman's chain
[Pre-Chorus]
Doomed if I do
Doomed if I don't
Doomed if I will
Doomed if I won't
Damned if I try
Damned if I fail
God damn you all to hell

[Chorus]
I'm no angel, I'm no savior
And I've never been a saint
Well, I know I'm not the devil
'Cause I still can feel the pain
Walk through fire and through brimstone
And there were no pearly gates
I'll be sure to ask about it
On my final Judgement Day
Judgement Day

[Reprise]
La-hah, laaa-hah, la-hah, la-hah-ahhh
My final Judgement Day
La-hah, laaa-hah, la-hah, la-hah-ahhh

[Bridge]
Watch for the shot
Watch for the shot
Motherfucker
Watch for the shot
Beware the ricochet
Watch for the shot
[Chorus]
I'm no angel, I'm no savior
And I've never been a saint
Well, I know I'm not the devil
'Cause I still can feel the pain
Walk through fire and through brimstone
And there were no pearly gates
I'll be sure to ask about it
On my final Judgement Day

[Post-Chorus]
In my final resting place
When I finally found my grace
I'll be sure to ask about it
On my final Judgement Day
My final Judgement Day

[Outro]
La-hah, laaa-hah, la-hah, la-hah-ahhh
My final Judgement Day
La-hah, laaa-hah, la-hah, la-hah-ahhh
My final Judgement Day
La-hah, laaa-hah, la-hah, la-hah-ahhh
My final Judgement DayEmbed
