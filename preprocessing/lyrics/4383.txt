76 ContributorsMr. Crowley Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head?
Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead?
Your lifestyle, to me, seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
Yeah, you waited on Satan's call

[Verse 2]
Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure?
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred
Manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And they scattered the afterbirth

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic, of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that maiden's call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall

[Bridge]
Was it polemically sent?
I wanna know what you meant
I wanna know, I wanna know what you meant, yeah
