18 ContributorsNightmares Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sinking, so sick of thinking
Of all the things you need from me
Who you think that I should be?
Itching to feel you with me
But I can do that to myself
Touch so soft but words that kill

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wanna look past it, cause you're such a habit
But I'm made out of glass and
Some wounds you just can't lick
The crimes that you have committed
You hold them against me
No nights, without you I can't dream

[Chorus]
So now I see you in my nightmares
(Or not at all)
All by myself, drowning in my tears
(It's just the cost)
Of keeping you alive inside my brain
I know it's strange
I'm dealing with the pain
I'm having nightmares, nightmares
You're to blame
You might also like[Verse 2]
Crawling, I know you're calling
Your number on my shattered screen
Type your name, my fingers bleed

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna look past it, developed a habit
Cause I'm made out of glass and
Got wounds you just can't fix
The lies you've told me have damaged my heart
And I'm manic
Tonight, I'm sleeping in panic

[Chorus]
So now I see you in my nightmares
(Or not at all)
All by myself, drowning in my tears
(It's just the cost)
Of keeping you alive inside my brain
I know it's strange
I'm dealing with the pain
I'm having nightmares, nightmares
You're to blame
So now I see you in my nightmares
(Or not at all)
All by myself, drowning in my tears
(It's just the cost)
Of keeping you alive inside my brain
I know it's strange
I'm dealing with the pain
I'm having nightmares, nightmares
You're to blame
[Outro]
You're to blame, yeah, you're to blame, yeah
You're to blame, yeah, you're to blame, yeah
You're to blame, yeah, you're to blame, yeah
You're to blame, yeah, you're to blame, yeah
You're to blame, yeah, you're to blame, yeah
You're to blame, yeah, you're to blame, yeah9Embed
