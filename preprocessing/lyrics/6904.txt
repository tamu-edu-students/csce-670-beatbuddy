One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket to the blues

[Verse 1]
Choo, choo train truckin' down the track
Gotta travel on, ain't never comin' back
Oh, oh got a one way ticket to the blues
Bye, bye love my baby's leavin' me
Now lonely teardrops are all that I can see
Oh, oh got a one way ticket to the blues

[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna take a trip to lonesome town
Gonna stay at heartbreak hotel
A fool such as I that never learns
I cry a tear so well

[Chorus]
One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket to the blues

[Verse 2]
Choo, choo train truckin' down the track
Gotta travel on, ain't never comin' back
Oh, oh got a one way ticket to the blues

One way ticket, one way ticket to the blues
