Nice to nice to know ya lets do it again
How we did it on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to ya
Nice to nice to know ya lets do it again
How we did it on a one night stand

[Verse 1]
It was like food for all of my senses
Our time priceless, no expenses
Like water to all dem dry trenches
She had a theme song for her every entrance
We had a: dinner and a movie
Fire up di doobie
Raised vibes for dis girl, scoot closer to me
I call her babe, she call me boogie
Her beauty, intelligence, really moves me

Nice to nice to know ya lets do it again
How we did it on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to ya
Nice to nice to know ya lets do it again
How we did it on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to ya
