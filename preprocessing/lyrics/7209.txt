4 ContributorsBalenci and Dickies Lyrics[Intro]
[?] on that motherfucker

[Chorus: Guapo]
Ayy, I'm a real dope boy I might mix up the Dickies with Gucci and Fendi
My kicks, they Balenci, and G-Star my jeans just to hold up the glizzy
My choppa bad bitch, I might buy her some titties
And I fuck with Bloods if I ain't red like [?]
And I fuck with Crips, they got hustle like Nipsey
And that blicky, you won't catch me slippin'
Don't tempt me 'cause I really up and get busy
Ride with extensions, got 30s and 50s
Too many shots to be missin'
Bitch, we the young niggas turnt in this city
I hit a bitch with a quickie, skrrt off and I'm leavin'
I leave the ho then she text me she miss mе
Alright, when the ho eat thе jimmy, she know not to kiss me
She swallow that cream like she eatin' at Krispy

[Post-Chorus: Guapo ]
Ayy, Percocet 30, this bih got me itchin'
These rappers be actors like they was on Disney

[Verse: Maxo Kream]
I'm thumbin' through commas, blue hunnids, pink fifties
My jewelry per-summer, I'm flyin', I'm Crippin'
Rock Givenchy and Fendi and Louis and Gucci
I'm gangsta and bougie, rock Balencis with Dickies
Choosy like Susie, your bitch wanna do me
Can't make love to a groupie, I bust me a quickie
Might fuck up the city with pounds of the Keisha like Brandy, Moesha
My trap fat like Nicki
Big Worm on the dodey, I'm servin' that smoke
When I come to the gas, kick your grass like I'm Stanley
Hellcats and Maybachs, we drive 'em like Camrys
My diamonds canary, my wrist band named Jerry
I'm shinin', you see me, might blind you like Stevie
Put diamond VVs in my tooth like a fairy
Beat the pussy like Springer, she callin' me Jerry
Keep a yellow-bone diva look like Halle Berry
She look like a singer, she totin' my Nina
She holdin' my fire, Mariah, she carry
Slide by opp block with the mop, I'ma clean it
I don't do the drive-by, park the car, hop out
Whatchu really talkin' 'bout? Pop trunk, grab the pump
Call me DJ Unk, I'll walk a nigga out
