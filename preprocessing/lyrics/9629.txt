5 ContributorsHold Me Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe I’m crazy, I've been talking to myself at night
And I'm feelin' so alone
If I can get the words out right to tell you how I feel, I might
But they're comin' out so wrong

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then the voices, they come rushin' in
Like a ten-ton truck into soft cement
Now the words make sense but I can't repeat
Because sense don't make what it used to be

I'm here, my love, but I'm floating, baby!

[Chorus]
Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind
You tied a tether here to keep me close
I've been talking to myself on some Icarus spell
But it got better when you didn't go

Oh, tell me when you wanna get out of here
And I won't need any more
Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind
You know I'd really hate to see me float

[Verse 2]
I tremble when I see your eyes; I saw them in a dream last night
And they heard me sing a song
I never cared for fancy art or poetry on old guitars
But they always sing along

Then the notes fill up like a big balloon
As I'm drifting upwards away from you
Now I'm screaming mad with two clenched hands
Will beauty come if I don't land?

I'm here, my love, but I'm floating, baby!

[Chorus]
Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind
You tied a tether here to keep me close
I've been talking to myself on some Icarus spell
But it got better when you didn't go

Oh, tell me when you wanna get out of here
And I won't need any more
Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind
You know I'd really hate to see me float

[Bridge]
Write it to myself at night
As long as you're here I'll be all alright
Write it to myself at night
As long as you're here I'll be all alright
Write it to myself at night
As long as you're here I'll be all alright!
[Pre-Chorus 3]
I'm here, my love, but I
I'm here, my love, but I'm floating, baby!

[Chorus]
Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind
You tied a tether here to keep me close
I've been talking to myself on some Icarus spell
But it got better when you didn't go

Oh, tell me when you wanna get out of here
And I won't need any more
Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind
You know I'd really hate to see me floatEmbed
