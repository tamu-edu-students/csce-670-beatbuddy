Yelling at the sky
Screaming at the world
Baby, why'd you go away?
I’m still your girl
Holding on too tight
Head up in the clouds
Heaven only knows where you are now

[Pre-Chorus]
How do I love, how do I love again?
How do I trust, how do I trust again?

[Chorus]
I stay up all night, tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on, wait ’til I hear our song
Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost

[Verse 2]
Never got the chance
To say your last goodbye
I gotta move on
But it hurts to try

How do I love, how do I love again?
How do I trust, how do I trust again?

[Chorus]
I stay up all night, tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on, wait 'til I hear our song
Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost

[Bridge]
How do I love, how do I love again?
How do I trust, how do I trust again?

[Chorus]
I stay up all night, tell myself I’m alright
Baby, you’re just harder to see than most
I put the record on, wait 'til I hear our song
Every night, I’m dancing with your ghost
Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost35Embed
