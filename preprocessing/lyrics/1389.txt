Set the phasers to rot
What has got you distraught?
It's negative attention at best
But call it nothing
Maybe it's something, a little bit, a little bit
Maybe it's something to do a little bit
It's all about ascension, I guess

(O-oh, here you go)
Take a picture or two
(Two or three?)
I can see you
(Oh)

Those aren't meant to bend
No, those aren't meant to bend
Those aren't meant to bend
No, those aren't meant to bend

Those aren't meant to bend
No, those aren't meant to bend

Tears falling down at the party
