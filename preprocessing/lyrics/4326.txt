Well, I've been lookin' real hard
And I'm tryin' to find a job
But it just keeps gettin' tougher every day
But I got to do my part, cause I know in my heart
I got to please my sweet baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, I ain't superstitious
And I don't get suspicious
But my woman is a friend of mine
And I know that it's true that all the things that I do
Will come back to me in my sweet time

[Chorus]
So keep on rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby

[Verse 3]
I went from Phoenix, Arizona
All the way to Tacoma
Philadelphia, Atlanta, L.A
Northern California, where the girls are warm
So I could be with my sweet baby, yeah
