10 ContributorsNumb Lyrics[Chorus]
Right now
I'm laying in bed with nobody to love
And my ex is probably out having fun hooking up
With the person that she told me not to worry about
But it's alright 'cause we're both numb

Right now
Still feelin' lonely as fuck
I don't even have the energy to try to get up
Should've never had a girl I got to worry about
But it's just life and there's no love

[Verse 1]
Girl you know it doesn't bother me
That I'm not with you
But I hope that I'm on your mind
Baby tell me that you thought of me
'Cause I thought of you, with a girl that I met last night
I don't wanna live in this fake shit
Don't want fake love and relations
We don't gotta make love through relationships
But we still fuck and we hate this shit
We still numb but we fakin' it
Bet you're laid up on your new mans chest
You can't feel shit 'cause you're too depressed
But it is what it is I guess
You might also like[Chorus]
Right now
I'm laying in bed with nobody to love
And my ex is probably out having fun hooking up
With the person that she told me not to worry about
But it's alright 'cause we're both numb

Right now
Still feelin' lonely as fuck
I don't even have the energy to try to get up
Should've never had a girl I got to worry about
But it's just life and there's no love

[Verse 2]
And there's no time
Why should I waste my life on you?
When you think he's more your type
You must be out your mind
I tried to smoke and losin' track of the night
But this time I just can't control it
Daylight come before I'm closing my eyes
Can't sleep when I feel so broken
I like to pretend that it's, not what it seems
But
Every time I wake up, I see her in my dreams
[Chorus]
Right now
I'm laying in bed with nobody to love
And my ex is probably out having fun hooking up
With the person that she told me not to worry about
But it's alright 'cause we're both numb

Right now
Still feelin' lonely as fuck
I don't even have the energy to try to get up
Should've never had a girl I got to worry about
But it's just life and there's no love3Embed
