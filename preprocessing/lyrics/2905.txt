28 ContributorsDaydream Believer Lyrics[Intro]
Chip: 7A
Davy: What number is this, Chip?
Other 3 Monkees: 7-A!
Davy: OK!, know what I mean, like don't get excited man. It's 'cos I'm short, I know

[Verse 1]
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings

[Chorus]
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen?

[Verse 2]
You once thought of me
As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, and our good times starts and end
Without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need
You might also like[Chorus]
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

[Instrumental interlude]

[Chorus]
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
