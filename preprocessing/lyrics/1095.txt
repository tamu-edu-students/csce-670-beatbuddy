Get up on the floor
Dancing all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin'

[Verse 1]
All the time, my baby, you on my mind
And I don't know why, yeah, but the feelin' is fine
Can't you see? Yeah, honey you are for me
Oh, we were meant to be
Dancing in the moonlight
Gazing at the stars so bright
Holding you until the sunrise
Sleeping until the midnight

[Pre-Chorus]
Get up on the floor
Dancing all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin'

Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole
Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole

[Verse 2]
Every time when I look in your eyes
I smile with pride, happy that you're mine
Joy in love, your love is true I know
You are the best thing that has happened to me, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Get up on the floor
Dancing all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
