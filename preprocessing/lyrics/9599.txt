Touching heaven, touching you
Touching heaven, heaven

[Verse 1]
Here we are and I need you in your light
Touching heaven, touching you
We can love, come and see me by your side
Touching heaven, touching you

[Pre-Chorus]
In my eyes, your perfection
Like a lovers harmony, such a blissful reverie
My eyes, touching heaven
Kept it faded in a dream
Touching you is touching heaven in my eyes

Touching heaven, touching you
Touching heavеn, heaven
Touching heavеn, touching you
Touching heaven, heaven
Touching heaven, touching you
Touching heaven, heaven
Touching heaven, touching you
Touching heaven, heaven
