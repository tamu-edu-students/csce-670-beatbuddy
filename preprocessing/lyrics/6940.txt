36 ContributorsLivin’ on the Edge Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't His
It sure ain't no surprise, yeah

[Chorus]
We're livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge

[Verse 2]
There's something wrong with the world today
The light bulb's getting dim
There's meltdown in the sky (ahh)
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister, you're a better man than I

[Chorus]
We're livin' on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling) (Everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all) (Everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling) (Everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
(Everybody, everybody)

Tell me what you think about your situation
Complication, aggravation is getting to you, yeah
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would, my friend
Again and again and again and again and again

Tell me what you think about your situation
Complication, aggravation is getting to you, yeah
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would, my friend
Again and again and again and again and

[Verse 3]
There's something right with the world today
And everybody knows it's wrong
But we can tell 'em no or we could let it go
But I would rather be a hangin' on

[Chorus]
Livin' on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling) (Everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all) (Everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling) (Everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
(Everybody, everybody)
