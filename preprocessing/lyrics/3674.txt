I wonder how you're feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to 'cept the sea
Who can I believe in?
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force
Who do I phone?

[Pre-Chorus]
The stars are out and shining
But all I really want to know

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you show me the way
I want you to show me the way, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, I can see no reason
You're living on your nerves
When someone drops a cup, and I submerge
I'm swimming in a circle
I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play my part

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone thought of healing
But all I really want to know
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, won't you show me the way
I want you to show me the way
I want you day after day, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I wonder if I'm dreaming
I feel so unashamed
I can't believe this is happening to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I watch you when you're sleeping
And then I want to take your love

[Outro]
Oh, won't you show me the way
I want you to show me the way
I want you day after day, yeah
I want you day after day, hey4Embed
