10 ContributorsNatural Born Killer Lyrics[Intro]
I've been havin' dreams about fallin' in love
It feels so real, but nobody's here when I wake up
Do you know my name?
The devil's in the detail

[Chorus]
I'm a natural born killer
Ooh
I'm a natural born

[Verse 1]
Take this hopeless
Broke soul off this
Remote control plot twist
A whole generation lost with no promise
Can you feel my love?
Do you know my pain?
It's in my head every night on replay
A deadly game

[Chorus]
For a natural born killer
I'm a natural born killer
Natural born killer
You might also like[Verse 2]
Okay, it's game face
Go time, don't break
Never stand in place
Just move, said don't wait
'Causе all day, they'll say
Nice work, but no pay
Good game, pump fakе
Reach out, touch faith

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel my heart?
Do you know my name?
Can you feel my love?
Do you know my pain?
I'll tear it all apart
And it's a cryin' shame
The devil's in the detail
Detail's my name

[Chorus]
I'm a killer
Natural born killer
So I'm a killer, ooh
Natural born killer, hey
Supernatural born villain
