Vacancy was lit
The guests were checking in
The concierge was cold
The water pipes had mold all over them
The room was fit for two
The bed was left in ruins
The neighbor was knocking, yeah
But no one would let him in

[Chorus]
Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human

[Verse 2]
Dancing through the night
A vodka and a Sprite
A glimpse of her silhouette
A night that they'd never forget

[Chorus]
Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human
Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human

She sought death
On a queen-sized bed
And he had said
"Darling, your looks can kill, so now you're dead"

[Chorus]
Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human
Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human again44Embed
