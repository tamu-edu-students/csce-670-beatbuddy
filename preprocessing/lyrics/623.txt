The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet, a peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues, but I find that
Lately, I've been crying like a tall child

[Chorus]
So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
胸がはち切れそうで
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't", so I can crawl back in

[Verse 2]
And I was so young when I behaved twenty-five
Yet now, I find I've grown into a tall child
And I don't wanna go home yet
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky

[Chorus]
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
胸がはち切れそうで
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't", so I can crawl back in
