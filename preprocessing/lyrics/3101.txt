Before the story begins
Is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine
Until the end of time?
We were more than friends
Before the story ends
And I will take what's mine
Create what God would never design

[Verse 1: M. Shadows & The Rev]
Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that somethin' would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears (Ahahaha)
Conjuring her deepest fears (Come here, you fuckin' bitch)

[Refrain: The Rev, The Rev & M. Shadows]
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it
She was never this good in bed even when she was sleepin'
Now she's just so perfect, I've never been quite so fuckin' deep in

It goes on and on and on
I can keep you lookin' young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

[Chorus: M. Shadows]
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know
I know it's not your time
But bye-bye
And a word to the wise, when the fire dies
You think it's over, but it's just begun
Baby, don't cry

[Post-Chorus: M. Shadows & The Rev, M. Shadows]
You had my heart
At least for the most part (Ah-ah, ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart
Let's make a new start (Ah-ah, ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But baby, don't cry

[Verse 2: M. Shadows]
Now possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring to the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehave
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
[Refrain: The Rev, The Rev & M. Shadows]
Must have stabbed him fifty fuckin' times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it (Eat the shit out of it)
Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

[Pre-Chorus: M. Shadows]
I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

[Chorus: M. Shadows]
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know
I know it's not your time
But bye-bye
And a word to the wise, when the fire dies
You think it's over, but it's just begun
But baby, don't cry

[Post-Chorus: M. Shadows & The Rev, M. Shadows]
You had my heart
At least for the most part (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart
Let's make a new start (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But baby, don't cry
[Bridge: M. Shadows & Juliette Commagere]
I will suffer for so long (What will you do?)
(Not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well, then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough (If it's not enough)
(If it's not enough)
If it's not enough (Not enough)
Try again (Try again)
And again (And again)
Over and over again

[Breakdown: M. Shadows]
We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have a wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude: Z. Vengeance]
Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(Yes, I do)
Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(I do)
I now pronounce you—

[Chorus: M. Shadows & The Rev]
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know
I know it's not your time
But bye-bye
And a word to the wise, when the fire dies
You think it's over, but it's just begun
But baby, don't cry

[Post-Chorus: M. Shadows & The Rev, M. Shadows]
You had my heart
At least for the most part (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart
Let's make a new start (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But baby, don't cry56Embed
