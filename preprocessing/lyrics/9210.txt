Ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
Miss Temptation, I don't think you know
You keep me waitin', know you like to take it slow
Miss Temptation, you never let it show
So persuasive, Miss Temptation

[Verse 1]
I wish that I had your body
I'm envious of your curves
In my dreams, I can feel your softness
Get lost in your head of curls
I tell you things I can't tell my boyfriend
Sometimes he don't understand
You feed my soul, that pisces effect
But I know we're supposed to be just friends

[Chorus]
Miss Temptation, I don't think you know
You keep me waitin', know you like to take it slow
Miss Temptation, you never let it show
So persuasive, Miss Temptation

[Verse 2]
You always tell me that you're lonely
You wanna open up to me
Wanna bloom, but we're a bit guarded yeah
Let's grow a garden
Don't hesitate if it's something you want, love
Don't let it wait
Don't hesitate if it's something you want, love
Don't let it wait

Miss Temptation, I don't think you know
You keep me waitin', know you like to take it slow
Miss Temptation, you never let it show
So persuasive, Miss Temptation
Miss Temptation, I don't think you know
You keep me waitin', know you like to take it slow
Miss Temptation, you never let it show
So persuasive, Miss TemptationEmbed
