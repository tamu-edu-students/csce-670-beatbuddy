Hold up and analyze
Come on, get on, get some
Listen close as I prove my point
(We do our thing, son) Yeah
Hold up and analyze, we’re more solid
Come on, get on, get some, yeah
Listen close as I prove my point
(Ready to make an entrance so back on up) Yeah

[Chorus: Nas & A$AP Rocky]
No comparison, we more solid than they are (Uh)
Me and Hit-Boy, they say we like the new Gang Starr (Uh)
Me and Flacko, they say we the new wave gods
Shout to Max B, he could be home any day, God (Yeah)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Wake up out the bed scruffy, sparkin' my J
Shine my nickel-plated then I'm startin' my day
My old lady call me baby, told her, "Pardon my age"
Twelve shells in the gauge like a carton of eggs
We goin' home like Eric Cartman, chromosomes on my conscience
Hear some niggas talkin' nonsense, call up Nasty Nastradamus
Rock the pearls and diamonds, break the promise, break her wallets
Break her heart and break her pockets, takin' notes like guidance counselors
Aristocrat like the chancellor, the answer to the, uh, panhandlers
The corners with the mans is up, the jig is up, the scams is up
Yeah, they hands is up, lookin' in the crowd, yeah
Tryna fuck the world, but my pants still up
Tryna invest, to all my G's, before we rest in peace
'Cause we sure to rest in peace
The rest is set, the record set as soon as I release
The rumors be, I roam the streets with no security
They know a nigga overseas (Uh)
Kind of swag that's passed from your mom and dad
Prada bags and we cheesin' on them Calvin ads (Yeah, yeah)
Might've peeped the billboards fifty feet when out in traffic
Starin' at them naked pictures, shit, you bound to crash it
See Nas LiveGet tickets as low as $71You might also like[Chorus: Nas]
No comparison, we more solid than they are
Me and Hit-Boy, they say we like the new Gang Starr
Me and Flacko, they say we the new wave gods
Shout to Max B, he could be home any day, God

[Break: Nas, Raekwon, Casanova Rud & A$AP Rocky]
Hold up and analyze
Yeah, A$AP Mob got Mass Appeal
Come on, get on, get some
Call up Nasty Nas, niggas hit the lick like ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2: Nas]
Wake up out the bed, wrap my durag up
Say a prayer, I'm thankin' God that mom dukes had us
Monotone style like Guru on some Preemo cuts
Crewneck by McQueen, go nuts
Jewels over my white hoodie like Juvie in '9-8
It's movies that I make, Peruvian white flake
It tore the community at a high rate, adversity I faced
I roll my own gas to make sure that it's not laced
Damn, I used to hit the block hopin' they see me
Watchin' Video Music Box, sittin' close to the TV
I was inspired by Whodini and Kool G
Got my first pair of J's, thought I was 2-3 (Air)
Invest in all my G's before we rest in peace
'Cause we sure to rest in peace, my shorty is a piece
A piece of mind, a dimepiece, I might buy her a piece of property
You might've had some joints, but ain't nothin' like me and Rocky seen
[Chorus: Nas]
No comparison, we more solid than they are
Me and Hit-Boy, they say we like the new Gang Starr
Me and Flacko, they say we the new wave gods
Shout to Max B, he could be home any day, God

[Break: Nas, Casanova Rud, Kool G Rap & C.L. Smooth]
Come on, get on, get some
Yeah, A$AP Mob got Mass Appeal
We do our thing, son
Listen close as I prove my point

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Tell Hit we got a hit, ayy, ayy
Tell Hit we got a hit, ahh
Call up Nasty Nas, niggas hit the lick like ah, ah, ah39Embed
