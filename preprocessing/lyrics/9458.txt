13 ContributorsWe Might Be Dead by Tomorrow LyricsGive me all your love now
Cause for all we know
We might be dead by tomorrow
I can't go on wasting my time
Adding scars to my heart
Cause all I hear is "I'm not ready now"
And I can tell that you didn't have
To face your mother losing her lover
Without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Cause she didn't have time
I don't want to judge what's in your heart
But if you're not ready for love
How can you be ready for life?
How can you be ready for life?
So let's love fully and let's love loud
And let's love now
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll dieYou might also like25Embed
