The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it, push too far you'll see
The kid has got a dark side
Back against the wall
La la la la la
The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it’s the last trick up his sleeve
The kid has got a dark side
That you don't wanna meet at all, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
They always picked on him in the class
He would wake up with anxiety attacks
'Til he put a semi-automatic on his back
He got murder in his eyes, uh, yeah
He wore his silence like a mask
Now he’s making up for all the violence in his past
Took it from his father who never bothered to ask
What his son had on his mind

[Chorus]
The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it, push too far you'll see
The kid has got a dark side
Back against the wall
La la la la la
The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it's the last trick up his sleeve
The kid has got a dark side
That you don't wanna meet at all
The kid has got a-

[Verse 2]
He never went to check under his bed
He was living with the monsters in his head
Sick of getting beat up
He listened, what they said
Told him do some very bad things
And when the time comes that he count to ten
Ain't nobody ever gon' fuck with him again
Feeling all alone, it was him against them
Decided when the lunch bell rings
That he'll sing

[Chorus]
The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it, push too far you'll see
The kid has got a dark side
Back against the wall
La la la la la
The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it’s the last trick up his sleeve
The kid has got a dark side
That you don’t wanna meet at all
The kid has got a-
[Post-Chorus]
The kid has got a dark side
La la la la la

[Outro]
You can't run, you can’t hide
(The kid has got a-)
You can't run, you can't hide
Someone let me off this ride
(The kid has got a-)
You can't run, you can’t hide
The kid has got a dark side
The kid has got a dark side
The kid has got a dark side16Embed
