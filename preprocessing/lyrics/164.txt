[Verse 1: Becky Hill]
Wrap me up in diamonds, cover me in gold
But nothin' they could buy me made my heart whole
I'd given up on romance, then I found you
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?

[Refrain: Becky Hill]
Can someone tell me what is happenin' to me?
You're my oxygen, now I can finally breathe
Didn't care for anyone until there was you
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?

[Chorus: Ella Henderson, Becky Hill]
Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da

Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da
Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?
