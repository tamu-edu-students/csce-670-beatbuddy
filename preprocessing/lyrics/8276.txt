3 ContributorsNothing Good Comes Easy Lyrics[Verse 1]
You say you want me back, but you already let me go
Sayin' things I never heard you say before
Suddenly, you're ready to fall in love
How do I know you won't give up again?

[Pre-Chorus]
When the going gets tough
That's the part you gotta ride through
Fight through, give your life to
When the going gets tough
That's the part you gotta ride through
Fight through, give your life to

[Chorus]
Nothin' good comes easy
Fight for me the right way
So I know you're here to stay for me
No matter what today brings

[Post-Chorus]
Nothin' good comes easy
Nothin' good comes easy
Nothin' good comes easy

[Verse 2]
The truth is the hardest pill to swallow
Your truth hit harder than you thought it would
When your heart fills your mind with perfection
It never ends up how you expected

If the going gets tough
That's the part you gotta ride through
Fight through, give your life to
When the going gets tough
That's the part you gotta ride through
Fight through, give your life to

[Chorus]
Nothin' good comes easy
Fight for me the right way
So I know you're here to stay for me
No matter what today brings

[Post-Chorus]
Nothin' good comes easy
Nothin' good comes easy
Nothin' good comes easyEmbed
