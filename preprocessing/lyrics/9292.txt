13 ContributorsBurial Plot Lyrics[Verse 1]
Been on the road, losing track of days
I pull you in while you pull away
It's like I always play to lose you
I saw your eyes filling up with tears
You pulled the plug and then you disappeared
This home has never felt so empty

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Effortless‚ the way you left me
Cut me open with your own two hands
Breathing is so difficult to comprehend
When the air I breathe is taken from me

[Chorus]
It's my fault that you're gone
I've been digging in the dirt
Finding every way to hurt
There's no light‚ it's just dark
Feel my body growing numb
Watch me as I come undone

[Verse 2]
Is there relief in the misery?
Thought we would last for eternity
Forever I will feel this hollow
It's not enough to believe in me
And now I'm left with the memories
One day I'll learn to live without

[Chorus]
It's my fault that you're gone
I've been digging in the dirt
Finding every way to hurt
There's no light‚ it's just dark
Feel my body growing numb
Watch me as I come undone
A burial plot for you and I
Where we can both learn to die
It's my fault that you're gone
I've been digging in the dirt
Finding every way to hurt

[Bridge]
It's my fault that you're gone
There's no light, it's just dark

[Chorus]
It's my fault that you're gone
I've been digging in the dirt
Finding every way to hurt
There's no light, it's just dark
Feel my body growing numb
Watch me as I come undone
A burial plot for you and I
Where we can both learn to die
It's my fault that you're gone
I've been digging in the dirt
Finding every way to hurt
[Outro]
A burial plot for you and I
Where we can both learn to die2Embed
