I'm mad at Disney, Disney
They tricked me, tricked me
Had me wishing on a shooting star
But now I'm twenty something
I still know nothing
'Bout who I am or what I'm not

[Pre-Chorus]
So call me a pessimist
But I don't believe in it
Finding a true love's kiss is bullshit

[Chorus]
'Cause I felt sad love
I felt bad love
Sometimes happy love (Happy love)
Turns into giving up (Giving up)
I felt hurt love
By the word love
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
What the hell is love? What the hell is love?
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?

[Post-Chorus]
(Carry me away to your castle
Where we will all live happily ever after)

My fairy grandma warned me
Cinderella's story
Only ended in a bad divorce
The prince ain't sleeping when he
Takes his sleeping beauty
To the motel on his snow white horse

[Pre-Chorus]
So call me a pessimist
But I don't believe in it
Finding a true love's kiss is bullshit

[Chorus]
'Cause I felt sad love
I felt bad love
Sometimes happy love (Happy love)
Turns into giving up (Giving up)
I felt hurt love
By the word love
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
What the hell is love? What the hell is love?
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
What the hell is love? What the hell is love?
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
[Outro]
I'm mad at Disney, Disney
They tricked me, tricked me
No more wishing on a shooting star41Embed
