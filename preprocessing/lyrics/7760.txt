I walk in, a vision in red
Your favorite movie playing on my silhouette
You turn to me just for a minute
Do you know my real secret?

[Verse 2]
Make my move
Spillin' all my popcorn over you
You're confused
What does a girl like me want with you? (With you, with you)

[Pre-Chorus]
I want your hands
Your future plans
To the bitter end
We said

[Chorus]
"Take a life for me," you know I'd do it instantly
In danger of a true romance
We are meant to be, I'd die for love and loyalty
In danger of a true romance

[Post-Chorus]
I don't like the real world
I don't like the real world
It's tough out in the real world
Let's go back to our world

Bullets fly, you took him down and now we're
Honeymooners, dreamin' 'bout tropical skies

[Pre-Chorus]
In trouble again
When does it end?
Will it ever end?
Save me

[Chorus]
Running from the scene, more money that we could ever dream
In danger of a true romance
Bodies left to bleed, they all had it comin'
In danger of a true romance
Thought I watched you die, I killed a man with tears in my eyes
In danger of a true romance
Saved you from that room, the powder and gold and the men were all doomed
Against our love, they never stood a chance
"Take a life for me," you know I'd do it instantly
In danger of a true romance
We are meant to be, I'd die for love and loyalty
In danger of a true romance

[Post-Chorus]
I don't like the real world
I don't like the real world
It's tough out in the real world
Let's go back to our world5Embed
