3 ContributorsGet Lucky (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Like the legend of the phoenix, huh
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning, uh-huh
The force from the beginning
Look

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Wе're up all night to get lucky
We'rе up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

If you wanna leave, I'm with it, uh-huh

To give up who we are
