28 ContributorsYour Guardian Angel Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I see your smile
Tears run down my face
I can't replace
And now that I'm stronger, I have figured out
How this world turns cold and breaks through my soul
And I know, I'll find deep inside me
I can be the one

[Chorus]
I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me into heaven

[Post-Chorus]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

[Verse 2]
Seasons are changing
And waves are crashing
And stars are falling all for us
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
I can show you I'll be the one

[Chorus]
I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me into heaven
You might also like[Verse 3]
Cause you're my, you're my, my, my true love, my whole heart
Please don't throw that away
Cause I'm here for you
Please don't walk away and
Please tell me you'll stay, stay
Yeah, woah
Stay, woah

[Bridge]
Use me as you will
Pull my strings just for a thrill
And I know I'll be okay
Though my skies are turning gray, gray

[Chorus]
I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me into heaven
I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me into heaven33Embed
