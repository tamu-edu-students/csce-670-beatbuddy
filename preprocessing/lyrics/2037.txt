9 ContributorsMEAN! Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said I take too much space
Half an inch from my face and you meant it
You grabbed my hands and you smiled
As you kicked me right out my own sentence
I'm glad you got the chance to be honest, I'm happy for you
There goes years of my progress
You said I take too much space
Now I know what you meant when you said it

[Chorus]
One thing I like about me is that I'm nothing like you and I never will be
Someone who loves how it sounds when they speak
You're not telling the truth, no, you're just being mean
You're just being mean
(One thing I like about me is that I'm nothing like you and I never will be)
You're just being mean
(Someone who loves how it sounds when they speak
You're not telling the truth, no, you're just being mean)

[Verse 2]
I went outside just to cry
Had this look in your eye like you won
Oh, but I can't be surprised
You care less the more damage you've done
I'm glad you're working through all your issues
Projecting on me will never be the way to fix you
You said I take too much space
And right now, I can't shake how it stung
You might also like[Chorus]
One thing I like about me is that I'm nothing like you and I never will be
Someone who loves how it sounds when they speak
You're not telling the truth, no, you're just being mean
You're just being mean
(One thing I like about me is that I'm nothing like you and I never will be)
You're just being mean
(Someone who loves how it sounds when they speak
You're not telling the truth, no, you're just being mean)2Embed
