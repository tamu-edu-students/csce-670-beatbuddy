The summer air was soft and warm
The feeling right, the Paris night
Did its best to please us
And strolling down the Élysées
We had a drink in each café
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa

[Pre-Chorus]
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

[Chorus]
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

[Verse 2]
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

[Chorus]
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry
[Pre-Chorus]
How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams

[Chorus]
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
We were living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer...2Embed
