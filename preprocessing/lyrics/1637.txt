Take my mind and take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, heal, heal

[Verse 2]
Take my past and take my sins
Like an empty sail takes the wind
And heal, heal, heal, heal

[Chorus]
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last

[Verse 3]
Take my heart and take my hand
Like an ocean takes the dirty sand
And heal, heal, heal, heal

[Verse 4]
Take my mind and take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, heal, heal

[Chorus]
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things lastSee Tom Odell LiveGet tickets as low as $67You might also like33Embed
