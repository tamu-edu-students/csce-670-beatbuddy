27 ContributorsFive More Hours Lyrics[Verse 1]
What you wanna do, baby? Where you wanna go?
I'll take you to the moon, baby, I'll take you to the floor
I'll treat you like a real lady, no matter where you go
Just give me some time, baby, 'cause you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when we're apart, I know my heart is still there with you
Five more hours 'til the night is ours and I'm in bed with you

[Chorus]
This right here is my type of party
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Five more hours, we're just gettin' started
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This right here is my type of party
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Five more hours, we're just gettin' started
Five more hours, we're just gettin' started

[Verse 2]
How you wanna feel, baby? What you wanna know?
Just pour another drink, baby, come on, pour a little more
I'll treat you like a real lady, I'll keep you up to code
I'll give you all my time, baby, you know
