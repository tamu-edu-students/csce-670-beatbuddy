6 ContributorsEloise Lyrics[Intro]
We could be a gunfighter
Unlatching all the bailing wire
Eloise, lemme see your sweet face
Come, face me

[Verse]
Chin up, we're young & in the dark
We saw him resurrect in a muscle car
There was an oracle
We heard there was a light show
Hotter than a June kiss
I'm blushing a shade of licorice
Croon with your night lungs
That old Cicada love song
Holy broken heart
A meaning-well American abattoir
You're around us, oh
Be around us

[Chorus]
Someone close our eyes
Make it so that we can find you
In our imagination, a magic eye
In the photo round-up, we look like a gunfighter
Modeled after Autry
Maybe Annie O
And we can trick-shoot bottles
And everyone aims slow
You might also like[Outro]
Oh, c'mon, be a gunfighter, baby
With you
We could be a gunfighter
For always
We could be a gunfighter
Oh, oh, ooh
We could be a gunfighterEmbed
