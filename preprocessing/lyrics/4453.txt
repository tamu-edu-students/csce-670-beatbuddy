106 ContributorsHell on Earth (Front Lines) Lyrics[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, the saga begins, begin war
I draw first blood, be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
We takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
Here come the D's, time to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
My 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit
Yo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic?
Nine pound, we rocked it
'96, strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked
Finish 'em off, well-done meat
Then send .22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

[Chorus]
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one-time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one-time
I ain't gotta tell you
Yo, it's right in front of your eyes

We rep the QBC, nigga, rep yours, it's all love
Milli' stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow-tip slug
Then crack down on wannabe thugs
Adapt to gat sound and bow down
Slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me
All that bullshit is just makin' me
More the better to concentrate on gettin' cheddar
If shorty set you up, you better dead her
I told you, shape and mold you, son you, then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind control you, double-edge blow you
In the B-I like I'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
International, you local
Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world and evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop
QB City, Godfather Pt III
Gotti, Gambino, and Ty Nitty
Scarface, rest in peace
[Chorus]
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line (Front line)
And the enemy is one-time (One-time)
I ain't gotta tell you
Ayo, it's right in front of your eyes
Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line (Front line)
And the enemy is one-time (One-time)
I ain't gotta tell you
Ayo, it's right in front of your eyes

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
You see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
It's deep in the abyss of street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
P.O.W. niggas is found M.I.A.
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
The God P walk with a limp, see
But simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent, G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long 'cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it
Quiet is kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb when they see us
I tell you what, black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryna make cream and that's that
Whatever it takes, however it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four-pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless
Blow-for-blow, let's find out who hit hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
Or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds (Nigga)
Live up to my words, if I got beef, niggas comin' in herds (Nigga)
We flush through, your clique get purged (Word up)31Embed
