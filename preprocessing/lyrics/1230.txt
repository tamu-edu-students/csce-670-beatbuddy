This town don't feel mine
I'm fast to get away, far

[Verse 2]
I dressed you in her clothes
So drive me, far

[Chorus]
Away
Away
Away

[Verse 3]
It feels good
To know you're mine
Now drive me, far

[Chorus]
Away
Away
Away
[Bridge]
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care
[Outro]
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
Away
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
Away
So far (Away)
I don't care where, far
(Away)
I don't care just where, far
(Away)
I don't care, somewhere farSee Deftones LiveGet tickets as low as $224You might also like35Embed
