27 ContributorsNobody Praying for Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a whisper lost upon wind
I'm the ember that will burn you down
I'm the water that will drown you
I'm a star that's just a black hole now
I'm a terrifying danger
I'm a fruit decaying on the ground
I'm a swallower of anger
I'm the tree that falls that makes no sound
I make no sound

[Chorus]
Cause if I stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
Cause nobody gives a fuck
Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

[Verse 2]
I am fungus in the forest
I'm a lizard with a poisoned tongue
I'm the child in the manger
I'm the one who sacrificed his son
Rust is showing on my armor
I am wheezing like an old man done
I'm a product of my anger
I'm the bullet in a loaded gun

Stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
Cause nobody gives a fuck
Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

[Chorus]
Cause if I stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
Cause nobody gives a fuck
Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me
(There's nobody praying for me)
There's nobody praying for me9Embed
