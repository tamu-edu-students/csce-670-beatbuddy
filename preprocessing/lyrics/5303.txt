Did you never give a damn in the first place?
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned (Cigarettes, hahaha)
'Cause in the interest of all involved, I got the problem solved
And the verdict is guilty (Off the pink)
Man nearly kill- (Off the drink)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ooh, huh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I feel like Nick Cannon (Nick), huh
'Cause I'm wildin' out ('Cause I'm wildin'), huh
I don't got on Vans (I don't got 'em)
But bitch, I'm off the wall (I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't)
Huh, feel like Nick Cannon (Feel like Nick), huh
'Cause I'm wildin' out ('Cause I'm, huh), huh
I don't got on Vans, but bitch, I'm off the wall (Wall, wall, water)
I said like insect (Ew), I be buggin' motherfucker (Ow)
Fuck on your mommy, my flow be sick
Like that bitch gotta vomit, to vomit, to vomit (Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta)
I'm hot like a comet
Insect, I be buggin' motherfucker (Insect, ayy)
Fuck on your mommy (Uh-huh, ayy)
My flow be sick like that bitch gotta vomit, to vomit, to vomit (Yuh, sick, ayy)
I'm hot like a comet (Ayy)

When I di-di-di-di-di-dick that bitch
And she see Jesus on some rapture shit
Throw my balls at her Pokémon, Ash Ketchum shit
'Cause I'm fly like a newborn baby wombat wing, ha, ha
Me and this mic is your Mortal Kombat team
I want some head, I'm thinkin' how zombies think
Beaming a pistol it look like, "Hadouken!"
Like mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday
Tell these pussy rappers that it's time to vacay
Rob yo' lady, told her put her hands up high in the air
Like she 'bout to hit the Nae Nae
They say I'm cr-cr-cr-cr-cray, cray
Can't control the nigga like we shootin' from the AK
But they keep me 'round cause, I’m a walking, breathing payday
Hot, but I swag, still nigga got the Ray Bays
Get away, get away, get away, get away
Better do you or do way-way, fade away
You sippin' Haterade, I'm sippin' Gatorade
With the lean in it and I call it a fade-orade
Ayy, I'm so toxic, frog, hop up on my dick
I think I'm a pilot, 'cause she in my cockpit
Plumber, uh, pipe it, get face like I Skyped it
Did her A$AP like Rocky
Rockin' in my motherfuckin', rockin' rockin' in my motherfuckin'

When I fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-fist that bitch (Huh)
I'ma make that booty jiggle like some kick back, bitch (Huh)
She gon' rub my Dragon Balls, let her make one wish (Huh)
What is that? She just wanna take the young dagger dick
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy (Huh?), ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy (Huh?)
She off the molly, she wanna take seven dick (Ayy)
Body to body, it's MC dagger, bitch (Ayy)
Think that I'm Illuminati because I got money, bitch (Like)

Bitch, I hit it first, on my weenie, hit the nae-nae (Huh)
Coming in hot like a missile, pussy, hey bae (Huh)
Falcon punch that nigga, make 'em up, up, and away, ayy (Ayy)
Watch this, uppercut, Super Smash Melee (Ayy-ayy)
I just made her spin on my dick like a Beyblade (Ooh)
I'm green like a spinach, I don't know you, then it's pay, ayy (Ooh)
Hummanah hummana, back fist, out my way, ayy (Ayy)
No Chris Brown (Oh), fuck her, make her look at me now (Wet)
When I'm in the pussy, say "Ow!"
You got no etiquette, just beginnin' like Genesis
Can you give me a rapper that I'm not better than, mmph? (Ayy)
Revenge jeans, I think that I might OD
On sauce, I don't rock Supreme
Suck my dick, Squidward's clarinet
Brought to life like I’m Evanescence
Wanna wake, w-w-wake, w-w-wake, okay, like
Big black (Black), dick in your mama mouth
Pull it back, push her whole wig back (Wig)
Tic, tac, your breath really P-U
Yo, you really need a Tic-Tac (Stank)
Big pump, Cobain, Cobain
Leave a pussy nigga with no brain, okay (Blaow)
Weenie Hut Jr. looking boy, tell him "Ole"
I'ma pull that pistol, make 'em Mr. Noodle, ayy
[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]

Huh, feel like Nick Cannon (Feel like Nick), huh
