4 ContributorsMy Person Lyrics[Intro]
Mm

[Verse 1]
I was lookin' for a long time
I never found nobody like you
I saw you order up a Mai Tai
And suddenly I wanted one too
Got your name, got your number
And we talked 'til they turned on the lights
I was lookin' for a long time
I didn't know that night I'd find

[Chorus]
My person, my heartbeat, my slow dance
My Sunday mornin' sippin' on coffee in bed
My know-when-you-know best friend
The stealer of my T-shirts
My reason for speedin' home from work
My saving grace, my everything
I've never been more sure that you're my person

[Verse 2]
Even when you blow the punchline
Nobody makes me laugh like you do
Every minute is a long time
If I ain't holdin' on to you
You're my stay-in on the weekend
You're my come undone
You're my call home, sayin' it's more than love
Mama, she's the one
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, you're my person, my heartbeat, my slow dance
My Sunday mornin' sippin' on coffee in bed
My know-when-you-know best friend
The stealer of my T-shirts
My reason for speedin' home from work
My saving grace, my everything
I've never been more sure that you're my person
Mm, yeah

[Bridge]
Look ahead up the road
And you know I'll see you there
A rockin' chair, little gray in your hair
Yeah, I'm still gonna stare

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my person, my heartbeat, my slow dance
My Sunday mornin' sippin' on coffee in bed
My know-when-you-know best friend
The stealer of my T-shirts
My reason for speedin' home from work
My saving grace, my everything
I've never been more sure that you're my person
Yeah, baby, you're my person
[Outro]
