3 ContributorsTake My Breath Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watchin' in slow motion as you turn around and say

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

[Verse 2]
Watchin', I keep waitin', still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
Watchin' in slow motion as you turn to me and say

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Just take my breath awayYou might also likeEmbed
