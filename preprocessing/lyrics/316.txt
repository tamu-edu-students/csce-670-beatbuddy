I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better than the summer
Of 2002 (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' "bye, bye, bye"
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singin' at the top of both our lungs

Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holdin' each other
I'm taken back to 2002 (Ooh)
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' "bye, bye, bye"
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singin' at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh
[Bridge]
Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' "bye, bye, bye"
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young
Singin' at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love, love, love71Embed
