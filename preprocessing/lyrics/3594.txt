[Verse 1]
It's a mystery to me
We have a greed, with which we have agreed
You think you have to want more than you need
Until you have it all, you won't be free

[Chorus]
Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me

[Verse 2]
When you want more than you have, you think you need
And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed
I think I need to find a bigger place
'Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space

[Chorus]
Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy indeed
I hope you're not lonely without me

[Verse 3]
There's those thinking more or less, less is more
But if less is more, how you keeping score?
Means for every point you make, your level drops
Kinda like you're starting from the top
And you can't do that
You might also like[Chorus]
Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy, indeed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, have mercy on me
I hope you're not angry if I disagree
Society, crazy, indeed
I hope you're not lonely, without me18Embed
