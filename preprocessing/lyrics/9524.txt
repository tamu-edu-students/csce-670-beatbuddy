4 ContributorsHere Lyrics[Verse 1]
We could fly together
Feel alive again
I can feel the pressure
Heavy on my neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
The weight of this feeling
Ooh, ooh
This time

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I want you here with me
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I want you here
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
It was a warmer winter
Must have been a sign
Fires growin' bigger
Happens every time (Oh, oh)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
The weight of this feeling
Ooh, ooh
This time

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I want you here with me
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I want you here
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I want you here with me
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I want you here
