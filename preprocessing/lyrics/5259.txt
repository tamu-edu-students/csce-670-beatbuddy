45 ContributorsBismarck Lyrics[Intro]
*radio static* ...which blew up the mighty Battle cruiser Hood...

[Joakim Brodén]
"So, did you find the boat?"

[Verse 1]
From the mist, a shape, a ship, is taking form
And the silence of the sea is about to drift into a storm
Sign of power, show of force
Raise the anchor, battleship's plotting its course

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pride of a nation, a beast made of steel
Bismarck in motion, king of the ocean

[Chorus]
He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the war machine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

[Verse 2]
Two thousand men, and fifty thousand tons of steel
Set the course for the Atlantic with the Allies on their heel
Firepower, firefight
Battle Stations, keep the targets steady in sight
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Into formation, the hunt has begun
Death and damnation, the fleet is coming

[Chorus]
He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the war machine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
At the bottom of the ocean, the depths of the abyss
They are bound by iron and blood
The flagship of the navy, the terror of the seas
His guns have gone silent at last

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pride of a nation, a beast made of steel
Bismarck in motion, king of the ocean

[Chorus]
He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the war machine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine
[Outro]
To lead the war machine
Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine
To lead the war machine
Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine20Embed
