13 ContributorsWave of You Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Where am I supposed to be
Washed up, pushed out, or on my feet?
Tell me is this a dream
Or am I stuck in a movie scene?

[Pre-Chorus]
Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' away, so crazy
So, baby, just take me

[Chorus]
I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn into you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in a wave of you, of you, mm

[Verse 2]
Oh, upside down, I'm tip-toein' under the sea
Lost and found, I hide in the memory
Crossin' lines, am I gonna make it to the other side
Or do I have to chase it? (Oh)
Oh, I speak loud, but don't hear my voice
Ten feet down, does it feel like choice?
Hangin' onto the words you say
But еvery time I listen, I just hеar white noise
And all I see are these flashing lights
Can't hold on while they're passing by
How many wrongs does it take to right?
How many wrongs does it take to right?

Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around, so crazy
So, baby, just take me

[Chorus]
I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn into you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in a wave of you, of you, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around, so crazy
So, baby, just take me (Oh)
Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around, so crazy
So, baby, just take me

[Chorus]
I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn into you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in a wave of you, of you, mm6Embed
