I can't work you out, are you thinkin' 'bout somethin' better?
Holdin' on to you while you drag me through stormy weather

[Refrain]
The only time you smile is in the photographs
And when I pull you close, it's like you're holdin' back
Before we turn to strangers tryna love in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessin' if it's me you're missin'
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sound of silence is a place we're dyin'

[Chorus]
Tell it to my
Heart, heart, oh-ah
Tell it to my
Heart, hеart, oh-ah

[Post-Chorus]
Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guеssin' if it's me you're missin'
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sound of silence is a place we're dyin'
Tell it to my heart

Before a light goes out, come and tell me now if something's fadin'
'Cause I can feel it in every single thing that you're not sayin'

[Refrain]
You move close to me, but I can feel the space
Whatever time we have I'm not gonna waste
Before we turn to strangers tryna love in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessin' if it's me you're missin'
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sound of silence

[Chorus]
Tell it to my
Heart, heart, oh-ah
Tell it to my
Heart, heart, oh-ah (Hey)

[Post-Chorus]
Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessin' if it's me you're missin'
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sound of silence is a place we're dyin'
