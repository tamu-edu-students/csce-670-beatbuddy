Woke up covered in sweat from havin' these wild dreams
Where I'm from, bright lights, they tend to be hard to see
Oh, I pray for strength, please let it wash off of me
I can't help myself from havin' these wild dreams, yeah

[Verse 1: Burna Boy]
Yeah, kept to myself, did nobody no harm
Unless dem was really deservin' it
Come from a place where you can't even sleep
Talk less of even dream in it
Dem na bеlieve in themsеlves den now
How can they now believe in me?
All of my blessings from God
Still don't know what He sees in me

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Ooh, I see so much further than what's in front of me
Whenever I fall asleep

[Chorus: Khalid & Burna Boy]
Woke up covered in sweat from havin' these wild dreams
Where I'm from, bright lights, they tend to be hard to see
Oh, I pray for strength, please let it wash off of me (Wash off of me)

[Verse 2: Burna Boy]
I dey feel like a steel water where dey run deep
Because the life I dey live today never come cheap
I feel like it's taken something from me
Have to sacrifice if you want become me
Life is a ride, I take the front seat
Let the most high drive, He can't go wrongly
Highs and lows, na lows dey won't see
But those same lows nah make the song sweet

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Ooh, I see so much further than what's in front of me
Whenever I fall asleep

[Chorus: Khalid & Burna Boy]
Woke up covered in sweat from havin' these wild dreams (Wild dreams)
Where I'm from, bright lights, they tend to be hard to see (Hard)
Ooh, I pray for strength, please let it wash off of me (Wash off of me)
I can't help myself, I'm havin' these wild dreams

[Post-Chorus: Khalid & Burna Boy]
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild dreams (Wild)
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild dreams (Wild, wild)
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild dreams
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild dreams (Wild, wild)
[Outro: Burna Boy]
Don't let them tell you you too proud or your dreams are too big
You should humble yourself, humble your dreams
Remember everything you see today at some point in time started from a wild dream
At the same time, wild dreams are dangerous to people
Who can't see further than what's in front of them
Remember, Martin Luther King had a dream and then he got shot1Embed
