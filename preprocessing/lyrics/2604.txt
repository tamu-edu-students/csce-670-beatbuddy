Darling, you're with me, always around me
Only love, my only love
Darling, I feel you under my body
Only love, my only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on, love, come on, love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart...

[Post-Chorus]
And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadows, whale song in the deep
A wind in the shadows, whale song in the deep

[Chorus]
Darling, you're with me, always around me
Only love, my only love
Darling, I feel you under my body
Only love, my only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on, love, come on, love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart

[Post-Chorus]
And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadows, whale song in the deep
A wind in the shadows, whale song
