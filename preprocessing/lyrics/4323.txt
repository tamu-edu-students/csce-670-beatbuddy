30 ContributorsEyes on Fire Lyrics[Intro]
Hoa-hoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Hoa-hoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Hoa-hoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Hoa-hoa-hoa-hoa-hoa

[Verse 1]
I'll seek you out
Flay you alive
One more word and you won't survive
And I'm not scared of your stolen power
I see right through you any hour

[Chorus]
I won't soothe your pain
I won't ease your strain
You'll be waiting in vain
I got nothing for you to gain

[Verse 2]
I'm taking it slow
Feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace

I won't soothe your pain
I won't ease your strain
You'll be waiting in vain
I got nothing for you to gain

[Verse 3]
Eyes on fire
Your spine is ablaze
Felling any foe with my gaze
And just in time
In the right place
Steadily emerging with grace

[Outro]
Ahh, felling any foe with my gaze
Ahh, steadily emerging with grace
Ahh, felling any foe with my gaze
Ahh, steadily emerging with grace46Embed
