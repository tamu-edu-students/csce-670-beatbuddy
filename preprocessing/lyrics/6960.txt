We will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war

[Verse 1]
Down eyes of shame
Made to feel dead again
Your words cut deep
Your lies are fueled by your need for deceit
Too scared to speak
You're only alive when you torture the weak
Now hear me roar

[Chorus]
I will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war!
I will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war!

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid
No remorse, no restraint
These scars won't heal
Now you're the victim I'm making you feel
Like you are me
I need you to know what you've done can you hear?
Can you hear me roar?
You might also like[Chorus]
I will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war
You want a battle
Here's a war
I will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war

[Bridge]
You want a battle, here's a war
You want a battle, here's a war!

Don't suffer in your silence
Know you are never alone
Don't suffer in your silence
Know you are never alone

We will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war
[Chorus]
We will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war
We will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war!

[Outro]
Here's a war!9Embed
