I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight"

[Verse 2]
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

[Bridge]
No, no, no
Mm, no, no

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight265Embed
