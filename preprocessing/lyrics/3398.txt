Ayy

[Verse 1: Ess2Mad]
It is what it is, but nothing's the same
Side ting tryna upgrade to the mains
Toxic love, can you please stay away?
Only involved if the love both ways
Only involved if the love don't change
Looked to my bro and said "Please don't change"
How many man out your group gon' back this?
How many man out your group gon' stay? (Bullet)
She told me that she keeps on flirtin'
I told her she looks better in person (Hahaha)
Stress on my head to attain high earnings
And the convos, let's keep it to business
Welcome to the Brum Town district (Lemme land)
A land for the drugs and paigons
If you get locked then your friends won't visit

[Verse 2: Canking]
Yo, I might go M-I-A for doing up real life GTA
Yo, feds tryna put me in the pen, but they can't get me in no way no way
Yo, tell a boy indicate try switch up quick don't get in my lane (Purchase your tracks today)
Yo, tell a girl she's insane (just another), just here for the fame
Yo, you know say I'm rapping like Sterling
Ay, 'cause sometimes I feel like I'm balling, yeah
When I look at my earnings, uh, uh, uh, yo
Bad Bs keeps twistin' and turnin', bad Bs gon' listen and learn it
And niggas are all the same and no, won't change 'cause the girls are a burden

Tryna run man up in the worst way
The side ting tryna talk about Birkin, about Birkin, it ain't even your birthday
And now, she really wan' play games but darling, I like playing them too
Bruck off your back in the bedsheet pattern like I do things a man can't do, think it's a joke, nah, I ain't joking
(Lemme land, lemme land)
Move your waist to my rasclart motion
Hold me down if you Phil like Foden
Grip your neck, should I squeeze or choke it?
From the ends where the gang reload it
I might just ghost it and say that I'm loadin'
And she knows I'm a little bit toxic
Tryna hold man like who are you holding

[Verse 4: Canking]
Yo, the opps them D-O-A
Bad B slapped it, don't know her name
She bopped you with an iPhone 8
Still tapped it like some Apple Pay
Peter Pan when I fly away (Purchase your tracks today)
Multiple girls, that's my five-a-day
Dead tings can't even get that time of day
'Cause I ain't even got that much time on my day
With a bad B tryna isolate, so you know, say I gotta put some ice on the cake
They call me CK all day all day, but I'm only really tryna see the opps them K
Man will mash work on the field like Foden
Mask on my face and it's not 'cause of COVID
Infiltrate the gateway with a trojan 'cause I know the opps love let hoes in
[Outro: Canking]
Yo, I know a love song, yeah?
