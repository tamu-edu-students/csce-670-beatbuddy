3 Contributors​villain Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stay away, don’t try to read my feelings
Hate the way you try to keep believing
All the shit I put you through
I’m fucking sick of me with you
Don’t come close, for any fuckin’ reason
Don’t you know I’m tired of you dealing
With all the shit I put you through
I’m fucking sick of me with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Are not the words I wanna say
But it’s probably better off this way
Cause who could ever understand
That this is just the way I am

[Chorus]
I’m the villain, no one ever misses
Everybody wishes I’d leave them alone
‘Cause I can't make it right I can't save a life
I’m the criminal, gotta say I’m the villain
Gotta keep my distance
Even if I miss them, I won't let them know
I’ll be the villain on my own

[Verse 2]
So I spend my time, away from everybody
In my life I’d hate for anybody
To think i just need someone’s help
When I can’t be with someone else
‘Cause anyone that’s ever been around me
Wishes they could just forget about me
All I do is hurt my friends
And hope they won’t come back again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When all I want’s to be with them
I’m only human in the end
But I won’t try to make ‘em stay
They’d probably leave me anyway

[Chorus]
Cause I’m the villain, no one ever misses
Everybody wishes I’d leave them alone
‘Cause I can't make it right I can't save a life
I’m the criminal, gotta say I’m the villain
Gotta keep my distance
Even if I miss them I won't let them know
I’ll be the villain on my own

[Bridge]
Don’t say that you see the good in me
Don’t say that you think that I could be
The one you really need
I’m born to be the enemy
Don’t say I can make it up
Don’t say that I’ve changed enough
I’ll never be the one
Can’t forget the things I’ve done

[Chorus]
I’m the villain, mo one ever misses
Everybody wishes I’d leave them alone
‘Cause I can't make it right, I can't save a life
I’m the criminal, gotta say I’m the villain
Gotta keep my distance
Even if I miss them I won't let them know
I’ll be the villain, I’ll be the villain on my ownEmbed
