2 ContributorsMy Time Lyrics[Chorus]
My turn, I'ma shine wit' this shit
Sweat and tears, I put my grind in this shit
Feels fine when I'm ridin' and shit
But it ain't safe so I ride wit' my stick
Heart swollen use my chain, gotta ice my shit
All I wanted was some ice so I ice my wrist
If my brother got funk then I ride wit' him
We gon' slide wit' them poles, we ain't fightin' niggas

[Verse 1]
If you my brother, take your funk like it's mine
Oh, we gon' slide, we gon' slide, and we gon' hit they block
I ain't never been a fuck or a bitch nigga
I keep a mothafuckin' Glock wit' a stick on me
If I got a fuckin' problem I'ma trip on 'em
Real nigga in my section, ask yo' big homie
Oh, when we ride, they gon' die, they gon' die
Die when we ride

[Chorus]
My turn I'ma shine wit' this shit
Sweat and tears, I put my grind in this shit
Feels fine when I'm ridin' and shit
But it ain't safe so I ride wit' my stick
Heart swollen use my chain, gotta ice my shit
All I wanted was some ice so I ice my wrist
If my brother got funk then I ride wit' him
We gon' slide wit' them poles, we ain't fightin' niggas

Been through so much shit in my lifetime
Put it all on the line, I won't stop mine
Oh, used to have a little now I got a lot now
Foreign car, beep-beep when I'm back out
When I was down on my ass ran me up a check
Me and my stick in the hood ridin' to the neck
Don't need the crowd I'ma do this shit to the neck
Suckas slide I'ma leave 'em on they fuckin' back
Oh, give a fuck about a sucka nigga
Slide down and I'm cluckin' niggas
Chains on my body, I ain't tuckin' nigga
So I'm clutchin' I ain't never ever trusted a nigga
Oh, make these bands flip again
Spend it all up and get rich again
In the hood so I'm ridin' wit' the stick again
Might hit his ass up and plead the fifth again

[Chorus]
My turn I'ma shine wit' this shit
Sweat and tears, I put my grind in this shit
Feels fine when I'm ridin' and shit
But it ain't safe so I ride wit' my stick
Heart swollen use my chain, gotta ice my shit
All I wanted was some ice so I ice my wrist
If my brother got funk then I ride wit' him
We gon' slide wit' them poles, we ain't fightin' niggasEmbed
