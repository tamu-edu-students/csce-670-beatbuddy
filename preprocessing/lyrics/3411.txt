Oh, when the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

[Chorus]
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

[Verse 2]
From the park you hear
The happy sound of a carousel
Mmm, you can almost taste
The hot dogs and French fries they sell
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

[Refrain]
Oh, under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

[Chorus]
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk5Embed
