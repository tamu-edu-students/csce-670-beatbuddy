1 ContributorOverboard Lyrics[Chorus]
We should take our time, it feels like we are rushing in
I should blame those eyes, because every time I look at them
I'm falling overboard and I can’t swim
Would you save, would you save, would you save me

[Verse]
Would you be my lifeguard if I was drowning
Would you be my therapist if I just needed to talk
Would you ride for me, die for me
Show me you won't lie to me
Would you do whatever for me or no
It's hard for me to trust somebody
My heart has been broke too many times
So if you love me then show me that you love me
Baby I don’t want to waste my time
Cause I'm the type to give you the world and that's all
Baby gotta know what it's like
'Cause it's not, it's not

[Chorus]
We should take our time, it feels like we are rushing in
I should blame those eyes
Because every time I look at them
I'm falling overboard and I can’t swim
Would you save, would you save, would you save me
We should take our time, it feels like we are rushing in
I should blame those eyes
Because every time I look at them
I’m falling overboard and I can't swim
Would you save, would you save, would you save me
You might also like[Bridge]
And I can’t swim, noooo
I can't swim
And I can't swim, noooo
And I can't swim
I am falling overboard (overboard)
I am falling overboard

[Chorus]
We should take our time, it feels like we are rushing in
I should blame those eyes
Because every time I look at them
I’m falling overboard and I can't swim
Would you save, would you save, would you save meEmbed
