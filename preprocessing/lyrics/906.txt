58 ContributorsPut Your Records On Lyrics[Verse 1]
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe sometimes
We've got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change
The more they stay the same
Ooh, don't you hesitate

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Verse 2]
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes
We feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same
The more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (Yeah!)
You go ahead, let your hair down (Girl)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Bridge]
'Twas more than I could take
Pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake
I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize
That you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to
[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (Baby, ooh!)
You go ahead, let your hair down (Uh, let your hair down)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams (Hope you get your dreams)
Just go ahead, let your hair down (Baby, let your hair down)

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (Yeah, oh, go)
You go ahead, let your hair down (Hey, hey)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams (Sapphire faded jeans)
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Outro]
Ooh, you're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow35Embed
