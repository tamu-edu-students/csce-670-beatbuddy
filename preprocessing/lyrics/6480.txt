22 ContributorsYou and I Lyrics[Verse 1: Michaelson]
Don't you worry there, my honey
We might not have any money
But we've got our love to pay the bills
Maybe I think you're cute and funny
Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you
If you know what I mean

[Chorus: Michaelson]
Oh, let's get rich
And buy our parents homes in the South of France
Let's get rich
And give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance
Let's get rich
And build a house on a mountain, making everybody look like ants
From way up there
You and I, you and I

[Verse 2: Romer & Michaelson]
Well, you might be a bit confused
And you might be a little bit bruised
But, baby, how we spoon like no one else
So I will help you read those books
If you will soothe my worried looks
And we will put the lonesome on the shelf
You might also like[Chorus: Michaelson and Romer]
Oh, let's get rich
And buy our parents homes in the South of France
Let's get rich
And give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance
Let's get rich
And build a house on a mountain, making everybody look like ants
From way up there
You and I, you and I

Oh, let's get rich
And buy our parents homes in the South of France
Let's get rich
And give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance
Let's get rich
And build a house on a mountain, making everybody look like ants
From way up there
You and I, you and I19Embed
