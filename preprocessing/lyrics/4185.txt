12 ContributorsDangerous State of Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
You say we're better as friends
Like I can live and forget
You got so good at pretending you’re sorry
From someone that I love to someone I see hardly
Someone I used to fuck to someone that won't call me

[Pre-Chorus]
You let me go 'cause of misunderstandings
Now that I know you better, I get what your plan is
Damage, gas lit
You’re driving me batshit
Wanna see me crazy? Well, maybe I'll let you have it, 'cause

[Chorus]
You don't give a fuck right now
Know you're in my head keeping me up right now
I'd be fucking you rough right now
But someone's in your bed keeping you up right now

[Post-Chorus]
You stand behind your walls
You don't know me at all
You stay just out of reach
Just so you can take advantage of me
You might also like[Verse 2]
If I let you get to me
That would be the death of me
You should know you’re dead to me
Murderer of my memories
Tryna get ahead of me
’Til you're giving head to me
Draining all my energy
Lovers turn into enemies

[Pre-Chorus]
You let me go ’cause of misunderstandings
Now that I know you better, I get what your plan is
Damage, gas lit
You're driving me batshit
Wanna see me crazy? Well, maybe I'll let you have it, 'cause

[Chorus]
You don’t give a fuck right now
Know you're in my head keeping me up right now
I'd be fucking you rough right now
But someone's in your bed keeping you up right now

[Post-Chorus]
You stand behind your walls
You don't know me at all
You stay just out of reach
Just so you can take advantage of me
[Outro]
You don't give a fuck right now
Know you're in my head keeping me up right now
I'd be fucking you rough right now
But someone's in your bed keeping you up right nowEmbed
