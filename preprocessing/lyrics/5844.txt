Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?

[Hook 1]
Come on
Come on
Come on
Is anybody there?
Come on
Come on
Let me tell you something

[Verse 1]
I was born as a bastard, no father, no master
A shadow in silence left searching for answers
Put up for adoption and left with no option
Another kid fostered to fester, forgotten
Take a look into these desperate eyes
As they’re cast into the wretched hive
But I ain’t going down alone

[Chorus]
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?
I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe

Come on
Come on
Come on
Is anybody there?
Come on
Come on
Lemme say this

[Verse 2]
Now I stand as a father, to men with no honor
Ashamed of the racists they used to call brothers
'Cause no flag can mean bravery
When bloodied by slavery
The rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior
And the sickening feeling in the air
Is the fear to speak that no one dares
So will I stand here all alone?

[Chorus]
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?
I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe
[Breakdown]
Live my life like I’ll die tonight
Dream like I’ll live forever
Live my life like I’ll die tonight
Dream like I’ll live forever

[Bridge]
(Is there anybody out there?)
I have roared at the world for years
(Is there anybody out there?)
Doesn’t anybody hear me?
(Is there anybody out there?)
This burden suffered, I’ve paid the cost
(Is there anybody out there?)
Not all who wander are lost

Is there anybody
Is there anybody
Is there anybody

[Chorus]
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?
I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe
[Outro]
Come on
Come on
Come on
Is anybody there?
Come on
Come on
Is there anybody
Is there anybody
Is there anybody out there?1Embed
