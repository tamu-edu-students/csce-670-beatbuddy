10 ContributorsI’m Toxic Lyrics[Chorus]
Bitch, I’m fresher than a prince, got yo gurl doing banana splits
When she fall in love, I move on to the next of kin
There he go again with that flow, that retirement
When I’m finished, she get ghosted, game over, bitch, try again
Yeah, I’m toxic and I rock it
This a shoutout to the girls who say I’m not shit
I’m obnoxious and I'm heartless
When you slip and catching feelings, then that is my cue to dip

[Verse 1]
They been calling me a dickhead, you know that I’m certified
She say I’m inconsiderate, I be like where's the lie
If you Wil E coyote, I’m road runner when I slide
Like a fox, I be a thief, I’m a heart breaker with no knife
I'ma wild out, they tell me die it down, I’m good hoe
She say that she hate me, but she come back for the wood stroke
Told me I should pull up, I told her maybe I could go
Then leave her on delivered, dipped out of the neighborhood, hoe
Mmm, Fuego, this dick made her KO
She get too addicted by the money, sign and payroll
Mmm, wait though, I prefer to lay low
Chilling in the backseat, making fate do what I say so

[Chorus]
Bitch I’m fresher than a prince, whoa, she fell in love once again
Once I hear them words repeated, I’m moving onto her friends
I be leaving them salty, on Twitter saying, "Kill All Men"
When I’m finished, she get ghosted, game over, bitch, try again
Yeah I’m toxic and I rock it
This a shout out to the girls who say I’m not shit
Yeah, you right, bitch, cause I'm heartless
When you sleep, I take your purse, and then I'm out quick

Bitch, aye, in my book, you a side note
That mean you the side hoe to my side hoe
You a filler, you ain’t canon on the main show
Baby I ain’t shit, I said I love you just for brain though
Aye, I be petty yuh, never spend a penny yuh
The type to drink too much and then I throw up on ya telly yuh
You said you ain’t feel it, I still hit though, with ya legs up
Ghost you then I move on to your best friend when I hit em up
Whoa whoa, I’m a dickhead, I’m toxic
When a girl say they hate men, that’s my shit
Catchin' feelings, are you dumb, that’s not it
I'm too cute for you stupid

[Chorus]
Bitch, I’m fresher than a prince, got yo girl doing banana splits
When she fall in love, I move on to the next of kin
There he go again with that flow, that retirement
When I’m finished, she get ghosted, game over, bitch, try again
Yeah, I’m toxic and I'm rock it
This a shoutout to the girls who say I’m not shit
I’m obnoxious and I'm heartless
When you slip and catching feelings, then that is my cue to dipEmbed
