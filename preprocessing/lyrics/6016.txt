Your love is killing me
Bad intentions layin' all round
I won’t let you sleep
Baby, let me take you upside down

[Chorus]
You're calling me, let's play hide and seek
’Cause tonight, we will do it again
Constantly, you keep following me
Don't you know I don't wanna be friends?
Here we go

[Build]
Your love is killing me
Here we go

[Drop]
Your love, your love
Your love is killing me
Your love is killing me

Your love is killing me
