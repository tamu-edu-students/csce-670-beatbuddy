64 ContributorsSmooth Lyrics[Verse 1]
Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you say, "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth

[Chorus]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Verse 2]
Well, I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name callin' me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turnin' of the world so soft and slow
Turnin' you round and round
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And if you say, "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth

[Chorus]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it, damn

[Outro]
Or else forget about it
Oh, or else forget about it
Oh, let's don't forget about it
(Gimme your heart, make it real) Or else forget about it, hey
Let's don't forget about it, no, oh, no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, no, no, no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, hey, no, no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, hey, hey, hey24Embed
