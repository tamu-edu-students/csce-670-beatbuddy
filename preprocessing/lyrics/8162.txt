8 ContributorsGreen Mountain State Lyrics[Verse 1]
I call on the green mountain state
I call on all the silence you make
Do you live inside, outside me?
As you speak through 10,000 leaves

[Hook]
There's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way
There's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way
It has always, always
It has always, always

[Verse 2]
In the house way down by the lake
A story told in a mystic way
And those roads, they roam through big fields, yeah
And those roads, my heart, they come still, they come still

[Hook]
There's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way
There's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way
It has always, always
It has always

I call to the letters in leaves
I call to the ones we don't see
My song is born on the wind, yeah
No end, nowhere to begin

[Hook]
There's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way
There's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way, there's a way
It has always, always
It has always, always1Embed
