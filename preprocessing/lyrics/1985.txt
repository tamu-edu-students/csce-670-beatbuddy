23 ContributorsRosemary Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's no sound
But the engine's drone
Our minds set free
To roam

[Pre-Chorus]
Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes

[Verse 2]
Our minds bend
And our fingers fold
Entwined, we dream
Of unknown

[Pre-Chorus]
Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes

[Chorus]
Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me

We slow down
As the engines stall
Our eyes catch sync
We explode

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes
Time (Shift)
As we collide with the energy
In other ways

[Chorus]
Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me...

[Outro]
We play in dreams
As we cross through
Space and time
Just stay with me12Embed
