Hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm

[Verse 1]
Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

[Chorus]
Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
[Verse 2]
Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill
Those of your needs
That you won't let show
You might also like[Bridge]
You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

[Chorus]
Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

[Bridge]
You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

[Verse 3]
If there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road
I'll share your load
If you just call me
