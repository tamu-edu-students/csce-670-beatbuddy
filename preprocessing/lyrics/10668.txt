22 ContributorsExhausted Lyrics[Chorus]
I think I'm in love, say it way too often
I can't play these games, think I'm switching up the offense
See me in LA, I be movin' cautious
I can't feel no pain rollin' up, I'm so exhausted
I be so exhausted, woah-oh oh, woah-oh oh, oh
I be so exhausted, woah-oh oh, woah-oh oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I close my eyes, I see the vision
All this weed done got me lifted
Pour a four and I finish tonight
I told my mama that I'm wit' it
Got the sauce like that's my kitchen
Middle finger to these bitches up high
'Cause I'mma do it my way, sick just like the flu, ay
Shawty said she love me, I told her "Who are you?", ay
I ain't with that lame shit, send shots up at your brain, bitch
All these niggas talkin', fuck 'bout what they sayin'
GTA I'm wasted, lately I've been anxious
I'm so done with this fake shit, I'm so done with you
I'm so done with you

[Bridge]
Woah-oh, woah-oh, mm, mm
I be so exhausted
Woah-oh, woah-oh, mm, mm

I'ma roll another blunt, yeah
Gettin' lost I'm never found
Guess I'm never good enough for these bitches in my town
I don't really give a fuck, I'm a king like where my crown
Can't think about tomorrow 'cause it all gon' hold me down
I done made it through the storm. I ain't talkin' NBA
Momma knew I'd be a star, momma look who I became
I got Von up on the phone, said he touched down in LA
I'ma get it how I get it, I ain't changed up for the fame
And I put it on my name

[Refrain]
Fake shit, lately I've been wasted
I'm so done with this fake shit
I'm so done with you
I'm so done with you

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I be so exhausted
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You done hold me down, for the last time3Embed
