27 ContributorsI Am Machine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here's to bein' human
All the pain and sufferin'
There's beauty in the bleedin'
At least you feel somethin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew what it was like
To care enough to carry on
I wish I knew what it was like
To find a place where I belong

[Chorus]
But I am machine, I never sleep
I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine, a part of me
Wishes I could just feel somethin'
I am machine, I never sleep
Until I fix what's broken
I am machine, a part of me
Wishes I could just feel somethin'

[Verse 2]
Here's to bein' human
Takin' it for granted
The highs and lows of livin'
To getting second chances
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew what it was like
To care about what's right or wrong
I wish someone could help me find
Find a place where I belong

[Chorus]
But I am machine, I never sleep
I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine, a part of me
Wishes I could just feel somethin'
I am machine, I never sleep
Until I fix what's broken
I am machine, a part of me
Wishes I could just feel somethin'

[Bridge]
It wasn't supposed to be this way
We were meant to feel the pain
I don't like what I am becoming
Wish I could just feel something

[Chorus]
I am machine, I never sleep
I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine, a part of me
Wishes I could just feel somethin'
I am machine, I never sleep
Until I fix what's broken
I am machine, a part of me
Wishes I could just feel somethin'13Embed
