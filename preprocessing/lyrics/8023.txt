3 Contributors40 Cal Lyrics[Intro: Rico Act & Hairitage]
Uh
Ri-Rico Act
Hairitage
Uh
Look, look, look

[Verse 1: Rico Act]
Yeah, you come with me, I turn you into a pro, I'm not an amateur
I'm sharper than the average cutlery, commit a massacre (Boom, boom)
A man award, steady rocking your scalpular
Haters inside a canister scared of my 40 caliber
Hell who do you do easy (Hell)
Fuck hoe like kiwi (Hoes)
I ain't got me no Maybach, but I think it's time to go get it
I-I-I dug a bitch New Yorkie, niggas be talking, they don't know my story (Bop)
Soon as I got me a Foreign, they started hating and I pulled out my .40

[Build: Rico Act]
I got some haters talking, they've been getting rookie nails
They want to go to war, I chew 'em up just like my fingernails
I roll with shottas, fuck the jail
I can't afford the bail, but if I do they know I get it poppin' like the 40 Cal

Psychotic drinking, heavy like I'm bound to fail

Ba-Ba-Bad bitches in the club, I make them love the world
Like selling alcohol and rollin' with a with the 40 Cal

[Interlude: Rico Act & Hairitage]
40 Cal nigga, do your thang right there
Uh, uh

[Verse 2: Rico Act]
I'm rolling up inside the block, quit acting funny
Boy, you're cotton soft
The hunnid choppers hotter than humidity, you drop your jaw
That's savage like I'm twenty one, twenty bucks I knock you off
Lo-Load it up with fifty and the drummy gotta pop it off
Fu-Fu-Fu-Fuck niggas been hating
Ah, fuck the start but I make it
I ain't making too much, look
They said I'm making you blush
I don't wanna be famous
Y'all-y'all niggas too basic
You don't want see my 40
I'll take a brain on vacation

[Build: Rico Act]
I hate a nigga talking, acting like he been about it
Then I come to your neighbourhood and I'ma catch you a hundred bodies
I roll with shottas, fuck the jail
I can't afford the bail but if I do they know I get it poppin' like the 40 Cal
