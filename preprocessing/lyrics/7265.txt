22 ContributorsGoing Up the Country Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm goin' up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm goin' up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm goin' to someplace where I've never been before

[Verse 2]
I'm goin', I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time

[Flute Solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away
I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away
All this fussin' and fightin', man, you know I sure can't stay

[Bridge]
Now, baby, pack your leavin' trunk, you know we've got to leave today
Just exactly where we're goin' I cannot say, but
We might even leave the USA
'Cause there's a brand-new game I don't wanna play

[Flute Solo]

[Outro]
No use for you runnin' or screamin' and cryin'
'Cause you've got a home as long as I've got mine
