26 ContributorsWho Says Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Turn off the lights and the telephone
Me, in my house alone
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t be free?
From all of the things that I used to be
Re-write my history
Who says I can’t be free?

[Chorus]
It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Baton Rouge
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you

[Verse 2]
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Call up a girl that I used to know
Fake love for an hour or so
Who says I can’t get stoned?

Who says I can’t take time?
Meet all the girls on the county line
Wait on fate to send a sign
Who says I can’t take time?
You might also like[Chorus]
It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Austin too
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you


[Verse 3]
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Plan a trip to Japan alone
Doesn’t matter if I even go
Who says I can’t get stoned?

[Chorus]
It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long time since 22
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again I don’t remember, don't remember you14Embed
