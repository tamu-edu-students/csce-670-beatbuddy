6 ContributorsReady to Roll Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fast lane through a hurricane
Open road and I'm ready to roll
Put the pedal down right away
Redline and I'm givin' it more

[Pre-Chorus]
City lights are burning bright behind me (Whoa)
Top down, I push it to the floor

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
Street signs and the centerlines spinning
Whoa, whoa
Running hot, I feel like I'm ready to roll

[Verse 2]
Taking off like a jet plane
High speeds and she's ready to go
Fuel burning like a freight train
Redline and I'm givin' it more

[Pre-Chorus]
City lights are burning bright behind me (Whoa)
Top down, I push it to the floor
You might also like[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
Street signs and the centerlines spinning
Whoa, whoa
Running hot, I feel like I'm ready to roll

[Post-Chorus]
Give me room to run
One more road I'm on
Give me room to run away
I feel like I'm ready to roll

[Bridge]
Fast lane through a hurricane
Top down on the highway
Taking off like a jet plane
Redline and I'm givin' it more

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
Street signs and the centerlines spinning
Whoa, whoa
Running hot, I feel like I'm ready to roll

[Post-Chorus]
Give me room to run
One more road I'm on
Give me room to run away
I feel like I'm ready to roll
Give me room to run
One more road I'm on
Give me room to run away
I feel like I'm ready to rollEmbed
