Boom boom da-da, boom boom da-da-da
Boom boom, boom boom da-da, boom boom da-da-da

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
You call my name
I feel better when you call my name
Let's just lay here together
We'll never change
I keep wishin' that we'll never change
Let's just stay here forever

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
I've been in a high, but I felt so low
Cut me like a knife and I did not know
I've been in a high, but I felt so low
Ain't it funny? (Yeah)
Never goin' back to the way I was
I wanna be trapped in the space of us
Never goin' back to the way I was
Now you got me

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
And just likе boom, boom, boom
Yeah, you chained my heart
Yеah, you chained my heart to your love
What you gon' do
If it breaks apart?
Yeah, you chained my heart to your love
