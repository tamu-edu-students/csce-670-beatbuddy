10 ContributorsLifetime Lyrics[Verse 1]
Called, to say hello
Your voice always takes the pain away
The thought is unimaginable
That I saw you for the last time and didn't know

[Chorus]
You were the one that I wasn't supposed to lose
I thought I'd have you for my lifetime
Have you for a lifetime

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm walking around in a haze
There's no color, only darker shades of gray
You showed me the way when I was lost and alone
But you never really showed me how to let you go

[Chorus]
You were the one that I wasn't supposed to losе
I thought I'd have you for my lifetime
Havе you for a lifetime
Who do I talk to when I wanna talk to you?
I thought I'd have you for a lifetime
Have you for a lifetime

[Bridge]
Never again, never again
Will I look into the only eyes that knew me?
Feels like a bullet running through me
Never again, never again
Will I look into the only eyes that knew me?
You might also like[Chorus]
You were the one that I wasn't supposed to lose
I thought I'd have you for a lifetime
Have you for a lifetime
You were the one that I wasn't supposed to lose
I thought I'd have you for my lifetime
Have you for a lifetime

[Outro]
I thought I'd have you for my lifetime
Have you for a lifetime7Embed
