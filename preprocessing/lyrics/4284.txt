5 ContributorsThe Best Is Yet To Come Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's nothing you could tell me
That would make me walk away
'Cause in my eyes you're perfect
And there's nothing I would change
I've seen you on your best days
And I'll see you on your worst, my love

[Chorus]
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay

[Verse 2]
'Cause I know the last few years
Have been a test of character
Remind ourselvеs on darker days
The best is yеt to come
In life, I've made a few mistakes
But you were never one, my love

[Chorus]
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay

I'll be here if you need love, if you need strength
Forever by your side until the end
With me, you really don't have to pretend
It's all okay, if you're not okay

[Chorus]
'Cause I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay

[Outro]
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my loveEmbed
