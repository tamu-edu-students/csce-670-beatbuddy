I'ma tell you the truth
Not like these girls on the loose
I'll put up with you, babe
There's some things I won't take
Baby, don't feed me false
Yeah, that turns me off
If I ask would you say?
Wanna be the last girl up in your place

[Pre-Chorus]
You're making me so high now
You're everything I'd ever want
You're keeping me so dry now
You're everything I'd never want, uh

[Chorus]
Baby powder, baby powder
Baby powder, baby, baby, baby, uh
Baby powder, baby powder
Baby powder, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 2]
You tryna get me to do
Things you want me to do
Don't need to sit down and talk
Already know what you are
Plastic on the floor but it ain't from me
I'ma go to the place that I'd rather be
You can keep trying to explain to me
But there're so many ways you can say it to me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You're making me so high now
You're everything I'd ever want
You're keeping me so dry now
You're everything I'd never want, uh

[Chorus]
Baby powder, baby powder
Baby powder, baby, baby, baby (All I ever wanted, ah)
Baby powder, baby powder (But you're turning me off)
Baby powder, baby, baby, baby (I want to get up)
Baby powder, baby powder (What you do, what you do is making me mad, ah)
Baby powder, baby, baby, baby
Baby powder, baby powder (Baby, don't do that)
Baby powder, baby, baby, baby (Baby, you're so dry-y-y)

[Outro]
Baby powder, baby powder (I'm just saying don't let me down)
Baby powder, baby, baby, baby ('Cause I'm really for you, I'm really for you)
Baby powder, baby powder (You should lift me up)
Baby powder, baby, baby, baby ('Cause I'm really for you babe, what you gon' do?)
Baby powder, baby powder (I'm just saying don't let me down)
Baby powder, baby, baby, baby ('Cause I'm really for you, I'm really for you)
Baby powder, baby powder (You should lift me up)
Baby powder, baby, baby, baby ('Cause I'm really for you, babe)10Embed
