4 ContributorsBroken Love Lyrics[Intro]
Once the winter weather passes by the mind
A little warmth inside us start to show it's kind
Even if I try to think of the better times
It just hurts me more but I feel so alive

[Verse 1]
Where's my love?
It used to be so alive
You were really all that I got
When the time ended for you and I
It made a little void in my mind
(Now, baby, I don't know)

[Chorus]
I don't want your love, all we did was fuck
Every time I think of you, it's just killing me
Why'd you have to leave? Why'd you have to be?
I don't want your broken love no more
Broken love

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so broken, still breaking with all this love
I was stolen then woken by all the memories

[Verse 2]
Like a fire
네 폰을 불태웠던 난
이제 수많은 밤을 태우고 떠나
Stay up all night
난 네가 아닌 누군가
달군 밤은 다시 차가워져만 가

Why'd you have to leave? Why'd you have to be?
I don't want your broken love no more
Broken love

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so broken, still breaking with all this love
I was stolen then woken by all the memories2Embed
