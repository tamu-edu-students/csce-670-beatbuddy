Do you want to play?

[Verse 1]
A-ring around the rosie
Hopscotch, Monopoly
Red light, green light
G.I. Joes and Barbies
Hide and seek, kick the can
Cowboys and Indians
Wiffle ball, paper dolls
Hacky sack and hangman

[Refrain]
Do you wanna play with me?

[Verse 2]
Tag, you're it, cops and robbers
Jungle gym, Chutes and Ladders
Tic-tac-toe, Mister Rogers
Marco Polo, London bridges
Simon Says, steal the bacon
Time out, trick or treat
Electric Company
Olly olly oxen free

Spin the bottle, post office
Kiss and tell, dressin' up
Playin' doctor, peek-a-boo
Two hand touch, Cootie
Little league, Looney Tunes
Scissors, rock, paper, zoom
Kickball, stick ball
Kill the guy with the ball

First comes love, then comes marriage
Then comes Adam in a baby carriage
