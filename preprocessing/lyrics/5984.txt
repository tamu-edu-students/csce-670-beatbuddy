17 ContributorsSunshine (The Light) Lyrics[Intro: Fat Joe]
(Cool N Dre)
It's 2021
Time to bring the light in
We gon' bring the light in, you know?
DJ Khaled, I see you
Cool N Dre, I see you
Pristine Jewelers in the building
L Boogie, Lorena, Terell, the flyest
Let's get it

[Chorus: Rihanna & Fat Joe]
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Been waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You yell, but you take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack? (Uh)
Boy, ya know that you always do it right (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Fat Joe, Rihanna & DJ Khaled]
She want that old thing back
Pretty young thing want that old G crack
Straight savage when I got my Fenty on
Do thе D'USSÉ with a touch of DeLeón (Uh)
She got a man and hе stuck in the feds
Said he gon' kill me 'cause she up in my bed
We wear chains that excite the narcs (Kiss it, kiss it)
Only G7s when the flights depart
Stash pesos in Turks and Caicos
Dapper Dan Don, the first to break those
Now back to Caicos
Throw your Rollies in the sky, my guys'll take those
Lower East Side, I'm up in NY
See me on the floor with Obi courtside
Baddies on deck, you know I'm lovin' 'em (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Still in a meetin' with Khaled (Another one)
You might also like[Chorus: Rihanna & Fat Joe]
Been waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You yell, but you take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack?
Boy, ya know that you always do it right (Yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Crack man and I'm out of the game
Silk shirts and a couple of chains
I go deeper and deeper
Sign the prenup, you know it's cheaper to keep her
Croc Birkin, a two-seater
Put you in Milan, you can kick your feet up
Take care, pinkie ring on the don, I told her

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Been waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You yell, but you take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack?
Boy, ya know that you always do it right
[Outro: Luther Vandross & Rihanna]
I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
Kiss it, kiss it
I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy1Embed
