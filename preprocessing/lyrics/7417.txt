39 ContributorsStop and Stare Lyrics[Verse 1]
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years

[Pre-Chorus]
Steady hands, just take the wheel
Every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal
For the life I lead

[Chorus]
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here, not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I've seen?

[Verse 2]
They're trying to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could

Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'ma run till you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down

[Chorus]
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, whoa-oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here, not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, you don't need

[Bridge]
Oh, ooh
Oh
Oh, ooh
What you need
What you need
What you need

[Outro]
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
I've become what I can't be
Oh, do you see what I see?31Embed
