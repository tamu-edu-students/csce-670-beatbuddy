All my favorite songs are slow and sad (All my favorite songs are sad)
All my favorite people make me mad (So mad, so mad)
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Rivers Cuomo]
I love parties, but I don't go
Then I feel bad when I stay home
'Cause I need a friend when I take a walk
I like spacin' out when somebody talks
I wanna be rich, but I feel guilty
I fall in love with everyone who hates me

[Chorus: Rivers Cuomo]
All my favorite songs are slow and sad (Ah-ah)
All my favorite people make me mad, so mad
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Jack Met]
I've been a yes man
'Cause I don't wanna know myself
I wish you the best, man
Now I got no more wishes left
I feel ashamed
When no one calls me
But I'd do the same
So mom and dad, I'm sorry

All my favorite songs are slow and sad (Ah-ah)
All my favorite people make me mad, so mad
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
