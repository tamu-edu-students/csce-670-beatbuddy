3 ContributorsLondon’s Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sweeter in the morning
When i look at your face i love you
Oh my little daughter
Your the meaning of grace i love you
And i'm like ooh
Take a little piece of my heart

Talking in your sleep
I wonder what your dreaming up dear
And if the world don't keep you warm
There's a blanket of stars above you
And i'm like ooh
Take another little piece of my heart

(Oooh)
(Oooh)

[Chorus]
If this is where you'll always wanna be
Then leave your tank on me

[Verse 2]
There's a place wе can go
And when you look at the light it splinters
Whеre there's pleanty of gas
To last us through the cold cold winter
And i'm like ooh
Take whatever's left of my heart
You might also like(Oooh)
(Oooh)

[Chorus]
If this is where you'll always wanna be
Then leave your tank on e

[Bridge]
I will love you tender
I will love you more
I will love you forever, more

(Oooh)
(Oooh)

[Outro]
This is where you'll always wanna be (Oooh)
In the sunshine standing next to me (Oooh)
This is where you'll always wanna be (Oooh)
In the sunshine standing next to me (Oooh)Embed
