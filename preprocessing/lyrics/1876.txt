53 ContributorsThe Rock Show Lyrics[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus]
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance, I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show
[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
(I'll never forget tonight) With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) With the girl at the rock show4Embed
