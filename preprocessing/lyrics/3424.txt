Yun Head, Obama loves you

[Verse 1: MC Prophet]
They call me P-R-O-P-H-E-T
I count up all the thots I see
I hit up her premium snap and ask her for some pics of feet, what?
She a lil shawty, all these bitches, man, they make me so horny
Put it in her booty and I'm recording
Call me a simp little bitch I'm reporting, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: MC Prophet]
I got one, two, three, four traps and they got asses
I got one, two, three, four bags they in the back
And Yun he called me up and said he got some shit that ain't whack
I told that bitch to go away and then she start talking back
She sound like

[Chorus: Yun Head]
君だよ 君なんだよ
教えてくれた
暗闇も光るなら
星空になる
悲しみを笑顔に
もう隠さないで
煌めくどんな星も
君を照らすから

(Ayy-ayy-ayy) I don't even know what that the fuck that means
I got all these foreign bitches and they on they knees
Call me a rice farmer 'cause I'm planting seeds
It's hard to tell that they're a trap when I'm clappin' cheeks
They got brown eyes, thick thighs, man I hope that bitch bi
'Til she open up them legs and oh my God, I'm bout to cry? Ayy
MC God is what they call me, all these traps they really want me
Eat my balls like edamame, cummin' fast, you can not stop me

[Pre-Chorus: MC Prophet]
I got one, two, three, four traps and they got asses
I got one, two, three, four bags they in the back
And Yun he called me up and said he got some shit that ain't whack
I told that bitch to go away and then she start talking back
She sound like
