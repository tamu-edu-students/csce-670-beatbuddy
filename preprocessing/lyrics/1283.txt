Almost Heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

[Verse 2]
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

[Bridge]
I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road, I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

[Outro]
Take me home, (Down) country roads
Take me home, (Down) country roads66Embed
