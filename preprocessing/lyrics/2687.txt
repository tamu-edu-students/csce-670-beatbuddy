They told me it will never take
No longer than a day
So I'll be on the move
I spend my time just tryna lay low
Lookin' for my way home
Lookin' out for you

[Chorus]
I hope
You come 'round
Before
We check out
I hope (Hold it out)
You come 'round (Hold it up)
Before (Hold it up)
We check out (Hold it up)

Before
We check out

You come 'round (Hold it up)

Hold it up, hold it up
Hold it up, hold it up
Hold it up, hold it up, hold it up, hold it up
Hold it up, hold it up, hold it up
