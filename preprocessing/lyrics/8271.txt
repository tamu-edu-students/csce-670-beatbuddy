19 ContributorsFeet Don’t Fail Me Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been posing with red skies
Retweeting picket signs
Put my name on petitions, but I won't change my mind
I'm keeping up appearances
The dark side of my privilege
Damn, thank God I've got my vice
The dopamine tuition will keep me wrong from right
But I don't like when my better side takes hold of me
I didn't want you to know

[Chorus]
Man, I guess I was scared
Feet, don't fail me now
I got to stand my ground
And though I'm down for trying
I am better in denial
So I hush, don't make a sound
Feet, don't fail me now
I got to stand my ground
And though I'm down for trying
I am better in denial

[Verse 2]
I, I cry like crocodile
Then drink opinions out
I've always got an answer, thе sun shines out my mouth
There ain't a rulе I'd wanna break (There ain't a rule I'd wanna break)
I'd rather kill than show my face
You might also like[Chorus]
Man, I guess I was scared
Feet, don't fail me now
I got to stand my ground
And though I'm down for trying
I am better in denial
So I hush, don't make a sound
Feet, don't fail me now (Feet, don't fail me now)
I got to stand my ground (Gotta stand my ground)
And though I was down for trying

[Bridge]
I was scared
But no blame's worth buying
Am I better hiding?
Why? Oh, why?
Didn't I try?

[Chorus]
I was scared
Feet, don't fail me now
I got to stand my ground (Gotta stand my ground)
And though I'm down for trying
I am better in denial
So I hush, don't make a sound
Feet, don't fail me now
I got to stand my ground, my ground
And though I'm down for trying
[Outro]
My feet, don't fail me now2Embed
