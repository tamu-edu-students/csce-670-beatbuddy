3 Contributors3:00 Am Lyrics[Intro]
Nobody, nobody compares to you
Nobody, nobody compares to you
Nobody, nobody compares to you
Nobody, nobody compares to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
It's 3:00 AM in the morning
And I'm thinking bout you
Thinking back to the past
And everything we would do
Thinking 'bout all the things
We wish we both could of said
Feels like there's 99 tabs
That open up in my head
It's 3:00 AM in the morning
And I'm thinking 'bout you
Thinking back to the past
And everything we would do
Thinking 'bout what we had
I know you think of it too
It's 3:00 AM in the morning
And I'm thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Nobody compared to you
And I was there for you
Everything was fine
I took my time
And I would care for you
But I saw the signs
Up in my mind
And I would share the truth
But nobody knew
What you were prеpared to do

And you stabbed me in my back, yеah
Stabbed me in my back, yeah
Took the knife and left it there
Ain't no turning back
And this is how it ends, yeah
This is how it ends
Once it happens
It can never be the same again

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
I know sometimes
We hurt the ones we love
And we cross the line
And I took you for granted
And I tossed aside
The love you had for me
And your peace of mind
It was all a lie

[Pre-Hook]
And I stabbed you in your back, yeah
Stabbed you in your back, yeah
Took the knife and left it there
And ain't no turning back
And this is how it ends, yeah

Once it happens
It can never be the same again
