1 ContributorHorizon LyricsEndless depths surround you
Waiting for the souls
Promised by the ocean
To the envious God of Seas
Shipwrecking bodies carry the secret
The new world will be forgotten
Shipwrecking bodies carry the secret
The new world will be forgotten
Dead eyes watch for the last time
The horizon in the North
Empty spaces
Fulfilled of light
Remind you a childhood dream
Now the seashore is there
The anchors are set
The forgotten land awaits
And the skies are open for you
Walking in lost fields
You see bright stars
In the dark skies
They shine
Halls of eternity hails you
For you blood is now glorious
For your name will last forever
‘til the stars will beat
They’ll beat your name
‘til the stars will beat your nameYou might also likeEmbed
