I need to get something off my chest
'Cause lately I have been upset
You make me wanna dress in red
And sing with my head out the window
I know it’s better to be cold
Better to wonder than to know
And so I'm gonna play the role
There might be some tears on my pillow

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know what I want
But I know I really, really wanna cling to you
Yeah my heart is innocent
But my body really, really wanna sin with you

[Chorus]
We could be lovers in the night
We could be strangers in the light
Is it going too fast for you?
Going too fast for you?
Lovers in thе night
We could be strangers in thе light
If it’s going too fast for you

[Drop]
We don't need to put no label on it, do we now?
Oh, my love
We don't need to put no label on it, do we now?
Oh, my love

Baby I know your love is bad
'Cause that is why I wanna have it
You make me walk on broken glass
And sing with my head out the window
Watching every tiny move you make
While I pretend to look away
You know I'll take what I can get
There might be some tears on my pillow

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know what I want
But I know I really, really wanna cling to you
Yeah my heart is innocent
But my body really, really wanna sin with you

[Chorus]
We could be lovers in the night
We could be strangers in the light
Is it going too fast for you?
Going too fast for you?
Lovers in the night
We could be strangers in the light
If it's going too fast for you

[Drop]
We don't need to put no label on it, do we now?
Oh my love
We don’t need to put no label on it, do we now?
Oh my love
(Label on it, do we now)
[Bridge]
Oh, would you cling to me
All night long, all night long, all night long
Repeat the ballads on and on, yeah, yeah
Oh, would you cling to me
All night long, all night long, all night long
Morning will hurt, but it’s so far gone, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
We could be lovers in the night
We could be strangers in the light
Is it going too fast for you?
Going too fast for you?
Lovers in the night (Oh, oh)
We could be strangers in the light
If it's going too fast for you

[Drop]
We don’t need to put no label on it, do we now?
Oh, my love (Woo)
We don't need to put no label on it, do we now?
Oh my loveEmbed
