4 ContributorsWait for You Lyrics[Verse 1: Zoe Wees]
I'm just prayin' you can figure this out
When there's nothing left, you know I'll still be around
And if all of this is dragging you under
I'll remind you of the world and its wonder
I'm just prayin' we can figure this out

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Walker]
These bitter dreams, they seem to last
And even though it's in the past

[Chorus: Tom Walker, with Zoe Wees]
I know it's hard for you to talk
Bare your soul and open up
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
Can't pretend to understand
I'll be here to hold your hand
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

[Verse 2: Tom Walker, with Zoe Wees]
I can't imagine everything you've been through
You've taken the bad times and made 'em good
'Cause when everything is dragging mе under
You remind me of thе world and its wonder
And I'm just glad that we have figured this out
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Zoe Wees]
These bitter dreams, they seem to last
And even though it's in the past

[Chorus: Tom Walker & Zoe Wees]
I know it's hard for you to talk
Bare your soul and open up
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
Can't pretend to understand
I'll be here to hold your hand
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

[Bridge: Tom Walker & Zoe Wees]
I've never met someone as strong as you
I've never met someone as loved as you
I've never met someone like you
I've never met someone like you

[Outro: Zoe Wees, with Tom Walker]
'Cause only you could make this into something beautiful
Only you can make a bitter song so sweet
And I can't pretend to understand
But I'll be here to hold your hand
I will wait for you1Embed
