65 ContributorsNever Too Late Lyrics[Verse 1]
This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong, who would have guessed it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I will not leave alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late
It's never too late

[Chorus]
Even if I say it'll be alright
Still, I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late

[Verse 2]
No one will ever see the side reflected
And if there's something wrong, who would have guessed it?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I have left alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late
It's never too late
You might also like[Chorus]
Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late

[Bridge]
The world we knew won't come back
The time we've lost, can't get it back
The life we had won't be ours again

[Verse 1]
This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong…

[Chorus]
Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late (It's never too late)
It's not too late
It's never too late48Embed
