I am visceral, new and original
Come for you like Armageddon
Dig your grave, I'll fill the casket
I am visceral, born unforgivable
Come for me, you won't forget it
Nobody's gettin' out alive
Nothing here is random, yeah, it's only by design
Hated from the start, it's the heart against the mind
See the bigger picture, let me open up your eyes
And tell me what you see inside

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe, Both]
Are you afraid of the dark?
It's coming straight for your heart
Do you know if you exist or it's all in your mind?
If you wanna find out, look death in the eye
So take it back (Take it back) to the start
Are you afraid (Are you afraid) of who you are?
Do you know if you exist or you're barely alive?
If you wanna find out, look death in the eyes
And say, "I am visceral"

[Verse 2: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe]
There's karma coming for you
And you know who you are
And when the hammer falls
It falls twice as hard
You try runnin' away
But you come back for more
You think you're getting close
You've never been so far

Are you afraid of the dark?
It's coming straight for your heart
Do you know if you exist or it's all in your mind?
If you wanna find out, look death in the eye
So take it back (Take it back) to the start (Take it back)
Are you afraid (Are you afraid) of who you are? (Who you are)
Do you know if you exist or you're barely alive?
If you wanna find out, look death in the eyes

[Breakdown: Eric Vanlerberghe]
And say, "I am visceral"

[Outro: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Are you afraid of the dark?
It's coming straight for your heart
I am unforgivable
I am visceral3Embed
