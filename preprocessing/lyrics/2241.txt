Oh I beg you, can I follow?
Oh I ask you, why not always?
Be the ocean, where I unravel
Be my only, be the water where I'm wading

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild

[Chorus]
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom honey, I follow you

[Verse 2]
He a message
I'm the runner
He the rebel
I'm the daughter waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild

I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom honey, I follow you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild

[Chorus]
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom honey, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom honey, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom honey, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you

Dark doom honey, I follow you
