Love, I have wounds
Only you can mend, you can mend, oh, oh, oh
I guess that's love
I can't pretend, I can't pretend, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Feel, my skin is rough
But it can be cleansed, it can be cleansed, oh, oh, oh
And my arms are tough
But they can be bent, they can be bent

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna fight, but I can't contend

[Chorus]
I guess that's love
I can't pretend, I can't pretend, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh), oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh-oh

And our souls they blend, yeah
Yeah, love, I hope you know (You know)
How much my heart depends, yeah
