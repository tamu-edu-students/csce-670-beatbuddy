She said, "I don't know if I've ever been good enough
I'm a little bit rusty
And I think my head is cavin' in
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me
And I feel like something's gonna give
And I'm a little bit angry"

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, this ain't over
No, not here
Not while I still need you around
You don't owe me
We might change, yeah
Yeah, we just might feel good

[Chorus]
I wanna push you around
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna push you down
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna take you for granted
Well, I wanna take you for granted
Yeah, I will, I will

[Verse 2]
She said, "I don't know why you ever would lie to me
Like I'm a little untrustin'
When I think that the truth is gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me
When my face don't seem to wanna shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty"

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, well, don't just stand there
Say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated, I've been wronged
And you, you don't know me
Yeah, well, I can't change, oh
Well, I won't do anything at all

[Chorus]
I wanna push you around
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna push you down
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna take you for granted
Yeah, I wanna take you for granted
Yeah, I will, I will
[Bridge]
Oh, but don't bowl me over
Just wait a minute, well, it kinda fell apart
Things get so crazy, crazy
Don't rush this, baby
Don't rush this, baby, baby

[Chorus]
I wanna push you around
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna push you down
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna take you for granted, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna take you, take you
Yeah, well, I will

[Outro]
And I will, I will, I will, yeah
Well, I will, I will, I will, yeah, yeah
Push you around and drag you down
I wanna push you around
Well, I will11Embed
