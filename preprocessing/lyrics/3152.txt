58 ContributorsSarcasm Lyrics[Intro]
(And it is from this world of darkness which come the evil, destructive forces of man's nature)

[Verse 1: Nicholas Matthews and Craig Mabbitt]
You've got me shaking from the way you're talkin'
My heart is breaking, but there's no use cryin'
What a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
If I had common sense, I'd cut myself, or curl up and die

[Pre-Chorus: Nicholas Matthews]
Sticks and stones could break my bones
But anything you say will only fuel my lungs

[Chorus: Nicholas Matthews and Craig Mabbitt]
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death

[Verse 2]
If you could be the corpse then I could be the killer
If I could be the devil then you could be the sinner
You could be the drugs and I could be the dealer
Everything you said is like music to my ears
If you could be the corpse and I could be the killer
If I could be the devil then you could be the sinner
You could be the drugs then I could be the dealer
Everything you said is like music to my, music to my ears
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
(Before an audience)

[Bridge]
Failure, find me
To tie me up now
'Cause I'm as bad, as bad as it gets
Failure find me
To hang me up now
By my neck, 'cause I'm a fate worse than death

[Pre-Chorus]
What a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
If I had common sense, I'd cut myself or curl up and die
(I wanna fucking die!)

[Chorus]
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us, we're just spillin' our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience
Don't mind us, we're just spillin' our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can
[Outro]
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
(Fuck you all!)36Embed
