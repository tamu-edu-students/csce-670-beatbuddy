33 ContributorsBark at the Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Screams break the silence
Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light

[Pre-Chorus]
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

[Chorus]
Bark at the Moon
Hahahahaha

[Verse 2]
Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save

[Pre-Chorus]
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

[Chorus]
Bark at the Moon
Hey yeah, bark at the Moon
You might also like[Bridge]
They cursed and buried him along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone, gone
In empty burning hell, unholy one
But he's returned to prove them wrong, so wrong
Ooh, yeah, baby

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

[Chorus]
Bark at the Moon
Hey yeah, bark at the Moon
Hey yeah, bark at the Moon
Oh-oh, yeah, bark at the Moon
*Howling*
