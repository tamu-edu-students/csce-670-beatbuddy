Oh, I'm late again, my people need me badly
Look at Herbert here, he's fighting with his homie
I'm fed up with your anger and hate
You always fight, punch, bite through the whole fucking day

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin]
I give you love
Shoot it right into your face, my love
Love is everything that you need
Love is missing in this loveless place
I share my heart with everyone

I wanna spread some love, I'm feeling the beat
I'm gonna give my heart to everyone around
I'm gonna share my love with everyone, everyone
