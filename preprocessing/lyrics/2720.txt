58 ContributorsUndead Lyrics[Intro: All (Deuce)]
Undead! (Undead)
Undead! (Undead)
Undead! (Undead)
Undead! (Undead)

[Chorus: Deuce & All]
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
Look up and see that motherfucking writing on the wall
When you see J3T thirty deep, he's down to brawl
Fuck the haters I see 'cause I hate that you breathe
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fucking disease
I got HU tatted on the front of my arms
The boulevard, brass knuckles in the back of the car
'Cause we drunk-drive Cadillacs, we never go far
But when you see us, motherfuckers, better know who we are
I got one thing to say to punk-asses who hate
Motherfuckers don't know, but you better watch what you say
From these industry fucks to these faggot-ass punks
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfucking drunk
I'm already loud, maybe it's a little too late
Johnny's taking heads off of all faggots who hate
'Cause I'm a God, motherfucker, there's a price to pay
Yeah, I'm a god, motherfucker, and it's Judgment Day
See Hollywood Undead LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also like[Chorus: Deuce & All]
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
I'm getting used to this nuisance of fags who badmouth this music
How fucking stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this
You cowards can't, you never will, don't even try to pursue it
I took the chance, I paid the bill, I nearly died for this music
You make me wanna run around pulling my guns out and shit
You're tempting me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrists, get pissed, and go jump off a bridge
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What, you think I just got lucky, didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kid's lips
That shit's as worse as it gets, this verse is over, I quit
Signed "Charlie Scene" on your girlfriend's tits
[Chorus: Deuce & All]
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway

[Verse 3: J-Dog]
White boys with tattoos, p-pointing right at you
We're breaking everything, r-rowdy like a classroom
Pack of wolves 'cause we don't follow the rules
And when you're running your mouth, our razor blades come out
Because there's nothing in my life except my dick and what I spit
So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots talking shit
Speaking of fag, already rapped with the drag
We killed him then we stuffed his body in the Cadillac
B-But you always press and you know I never stress
With Loki DMS, J-Johnny to my left
Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
I grew up on drive-bys and LA gang signs
So what the fuck you know about being a gangster?
And what the fuck you know about being in danger?
You ain't doing this so you know you're just talking shit
Mad at all of us 'cause every song is a fucking hit
[Chorus: Deuce & All]
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway

[Outro: Johnny 3 Tears & All]
Undead!
Motherfucking time to ride, ride
Undead!
See you duck when we drive by
Undead!
Motherfucking time to ride, ride
Undead!
Won't you punks just die, die, die?
Undead!27Embed
