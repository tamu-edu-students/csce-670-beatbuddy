10 ContributorsMore Than a Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
I met her when I was  still with my ex, but
Her lipstick was blood red, she wore her hair messed up
She was my best friend when I had a boyfriend
But she was on my mind when I was in his bed

[Pre-Chorus]
So we kept in touch 'cause I wanted to touch her
I got kinda drunk and told her that I liked her
She said, "You're the best," this girl has got me all messed up
Up, up
'Cause

[Chorus]
When she bites her lip, looks at me like that
I wanna be morе than a friend, more than a friend
Doеs she feel the same? Does she want me back ?
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
I have you close but I want more
I want your t-shirt on the floor
When you bite your lip, look at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
(More than a friend)

[Verse 2]
So fucking confusing  the way that she texts me
Keeps saying, "I love you ," wish she really meant it (Hey, I love you)
Sometimes she comes over, we call it a girl's night
When she takes her clothes off, I know that she's my type (Oh my god)

So we kept in touch 'cause I wanted to touch her
I got kinda drunk and told her that I liked her
She said, "You're the best," this girl has got me all messed up
(All messed up in my mind)
Up, up
'Cause

[Chorus]
When she bites her lip, looks at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
Does she feel the same? Does she want me back ?
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
I have you close but I want more
I want your t-shirt on the floor
When you bite your lip, look at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend

[Bridge]
My hands 'round her body
Her perfume left on me
On top of the dresser
I wanna undress her
My hands 'round her body
Her perfume left on me
This girl's got me all messed up
[Chorus]
When she bites her lip, looks at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
Does she feel the same? Does she want me back ?
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
I have you close but I want more
I want your t-shirt on my floor
When you bite your lip, look at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend2Embed
