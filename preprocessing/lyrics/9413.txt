18 ContributorsAt the Hop Lyrics[Intro]
Bah-bah-bah-bah
Bah-bah-bah-bah
Bah-bah-bah-bah
Bah-bah-bah-bah, at the hop

[Verse 1]
Well, you can rock it you can roll it
Do the stomp and even stroll it at the hop
When the record starts spinnin'
You chalypso when you chicken at the hop
Do the dance sensations that are sweepin' the nation at the hop

[Chorus]
Let's go to the hop
Let's go to the hop (Oh baby)
Let's go to the hop (Oh baby)
Let's go to the hop
Come on, let's go to the hop

[Verse 2]
Well, you can swing it you can groove it
You can really start to move it at the hop
Where the jockey is the smoothest
And the music is the coolest at the hop
All the cats and the chicks can get their kicks at the hop
Let's go

Let's go to the hop
Let's go to the hop (Oh baby)
Let's go to the hop (Oh baby)
Let's go to the hop
Come on, let's go to the hop
Let's go

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, you can rock it you can roll it
Do the stomp and even stroll it at the hop
When the record starts spinnin'
You chalypso when you chicken at the hop
Do the dance sensations that are sweepin' the nation at the hop

[Verse 4]
You can swing it you can groove it
You can really start to move it at the hop
Where the jockey is the smoothest
And the music is the coolest at the hop
All the cats and the chicks can get their kicks at the hop
Let's go

[Chorus]
Let's go to the hop
Let's go to the hop (Oh baby)
Let's go to the hop (Oh baby)
Let's go to the hop
Come on, let's go to the hop
