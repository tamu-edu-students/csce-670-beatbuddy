Steady callin' my phone
I done told you before that it's over, leave me 'lone
Know it's hurtin' you to see me gone
Dark clouds, you gon' see me storm
I won't go back
But trust me, you're gon' hold that
Hold that (Mmm, mmm)

[Post-Chorus]
Get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now (Mmm, mmm)
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now (Mmm, mmm)

[Verse 1: Lil Tjay]
I ain't tryna play these games no more
I don't wanna be textin' your name no more
I ain't tryna feel this pain no more
Girl, I'm sorry, but my feelings ain't the same no more (No)
Used to be my homie, you ain't gang no more (No)
I am not a nigga you could claim no more (No)
Traumatized, hoping it don't rain no more
You done put me through some things that done changed my aura
Now all around the world, I explore, no Dora
New bitch, I might drip her in Dior
Ass fat, shawty straight heat, no Florida
Bad and she do it for herself, I applaud her
No needs, yeah, I'm talkin' my boo
So please, leave me alone I'm through
And it's all 'cause what you started
I been told you you gon' lose (Mmm)

I won't go back (Go back)
But trust me, you're gon' hold that
Hold that (Mmm, mmm)

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
I ain't tryna play no games, my love
I'm one of a kind, couldn't fake, my love
Earthquake, make somethin' shake, my love
Most of them can't even relate, my love
Used to be gang, oh, now you're not gang
Used to have fun, no, now you got shame
Used to catch flights, but now I'm not playin'
Play on words, she love it when a nigga sing
I ain't tryna play your game no more
No, you can't wear my chain no more
We are not a thing, can't take no more
Waitin' on your king, you could wait some more
Yeah, I remember days when I used to adore her
Funny how this shit just flipped like a quarter
Get a new thing, I'ma Fendi and Dior her
Get a mood swing, I'll be gone by tomorrow (Mmm, mmm)
[Chorus: Lil Tjay & 6LACK]

But trust me, you're gon' hold that (Hold that)
Hold that (Mmm, mmm)
