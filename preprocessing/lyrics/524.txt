32 ContributorsGood Looking Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tides thrash inside, baby, I'm high octane
Fever in a shock wave
My core vibrates in an opium haze
Yet you think we're the same

[Chorus]
The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns out, there's more
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy

[Verse 2]
Play casino holes of my eyeballs
Roll the dice on my thighs
You stopped for breath and I sped up
Just to impress you

[Chorus]
The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns out, there's more
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy

[Refrain]
My good looking boy
My good looking boy
My good looking boy
Oh, my good looking boy

You're not who you are to anyone, to anyone
You're not who you are to anyone, to anyone, these days
I'm not who I am to anyone, no, not me at all
I'm not who I am to anyone these days, not at all

[Chorus]
The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
(Not to anyone, anyone, anyone)
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns out, there's more
(Not to anyone, anyone, anyone)
(Not to anyone, anyone, anyone)
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy11Embed
