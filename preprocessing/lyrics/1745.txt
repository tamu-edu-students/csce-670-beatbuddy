[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They have taken Cleopatra

[Bridge]
Run run run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra)
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cleopatra)
[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls
You might also like[Refrain]
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

[Outro]
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
[Part II]

[Segue]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
[Verse 2]
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, that's right
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
