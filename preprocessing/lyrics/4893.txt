Bitch's on me takin' this Blueberry Lemonade
Bitch ass nigga, axe in this bitch, bitch ass nigga
(In his motherfuckin' head) bitch ass nigga
Bitch ass nigga, ayy (Slit your motherfuckin' throat)
All the motherfuckin' blood in the Blueberry Lemonade
Nigga what's that made? Raspberry Lemonade
Bitch ass nigga, boys what? What you sippin' in, bitch?
I'm sippin' blueberry lemonade, okay, ayy
Blueberry lemonade, blueberry lemonade, ayy
Blueberry lemonade, blueberry lemonade, ayy
Blueberry lemonade, blueberry lemonade, ayy
Ayy, okay, ayy, okay

[Verse 1: Craig Xen]
Blueberry lemonade, Honeyberry gymshorts
Posted with your bitch, she count my money burning Newports
Blueberry lemonade, BlackBerry cellphone
Black bandana 'round my toes, I don't bang, no
Blueberry candy paint, screw back in that tape deck
Take your bitch, I scrape her neck then skate off with that paycheck
Blueberry lemonade, you can keep your Hennessy
Xen gone keep it pimpin', bitch quit attempting to end me

[Hook: Craig Xen & NEDARB]
Blueberry lemonade, blueberry lemonade
Blueberry lemonade, ayy, blueberry lemonade (ay, ayy)
Blueberry lemonade, blueberry lemonade (ay)
Blueberry lemonade, (why) blueberry lemonade
Blueberry lemonade, say, blueberry lemonade

Young Ned came through with a bad bitch on my hip, ayy
Young Ned came through and she swallow all of my dick, ayy

Fuck around with me, you finna end up
On Young Ned dead list, ayy
She wanna ride with me, she wanna die with me

[Verse 3: Lil Peep]
Blueberry, Lemonade, hoes mad, let 'em hate
I'm a young stunna, coulda been on Young Money
I feel like Dwayne Carter, all the freaks love me
Kick the bitch out, if she don't suck me
Pull my dick out, let yo ho suck me
Bitch I'm so ugly, but she still fuck me
Bitch I'm backstage, trap-phone makin' plays
Bitch I'm that dope, pull up lookin' like coke
I'm an asshole, drugs make my night slow (Make my night slow)
And I love snow, make yo bitch sniff coke (Sniff coke, yah)
On my dick though (Yah), I got 6 hoes (Yah, Yah)5Embed
