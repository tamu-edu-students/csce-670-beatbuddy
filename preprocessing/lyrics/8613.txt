I'm stranded here again
Another Friday night
Turn up the music
Black out the lights
Best kind of scene
I shouldn't have been
Bandit's in charge of the silver machine
[Pre-Chorus]
One of our friends is along for the ride
Hanging from the window, out of his mind
I don't want my luck to fall at my feet
Don't wanna feel a thing, just wanna hear you scream

[Chorus]
These are
These are the days that follow you home
These are the days that kiss you on your broken nose
These are the days
I don't miss the feeling of being alone
Thеse are the days, thеse are the days

[Verse 2]
We were breaking the limit
Then we broke down
Turned to the left to some no-name town
Everybody's got a dream
I like them best when I'm in it
Coming 'round the corner, I'll be there in a minute
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm coming up on something sweet
I'm leaving with the first person I meet
I'm holding out
I'm hanging on
For the moment when it all goes wrong

[Chorus]
These are
These are the days that follow you home
These are the days that kiss you on your broken nose
These are the days
I don't miss the feeling of being alone
These are the days, these are the days

[Bridge]
And we can do anything we want
For a while
They say
And tell you to behave
With a smile
Don't turn
Don't turn and run away
Don't hide
'Cause we can do anything we want
For a while
I think we're gonna be okay
Yeah
I think we're gonna be okay
[Chorus]
These are
These are the days that follow you home
These are the days that kiss you on your broken nose
These are the days
I don't miss the feeling of being alone
These are the days, these are the days

[Outro]
These days
I think we're gonna be okay1Embed
