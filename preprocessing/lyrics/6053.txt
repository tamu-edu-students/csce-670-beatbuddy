10 ContributorsFix It to Break It Lyrics[Verse 1]
Remember that time I made you laugh?
I would give in to hear that sound again
Missing the lines on both sides of your face
And I hate that that's all I have now

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I just fixing it, just to break it?
Am I just hanging in, just so we can drown
Like the love we thought we found?
Now, we're hoping that we don't just hit the ground

[Chorus]
I've been pulling you close, but pushing me further
I've been holdin' it back that I see you're different
Sick of me reminding you
To love me like you say you do
And I've been hurting myself to keep you from leaving
I've been wondering whether we'll last the season
Wish we could've made this work
But now I know that I need more
I need more, oh
I need more
I need more

[Verse 2]
Afraid that I'll lose you in the crowd
I wish that I was a priority
Then you walked out on me with a straight look on your face
And said you've had enough
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But then you came back in to try to fix it
But never helping me
When I start to drown like the love we thought we found
Is it worth the pain if I should stick around?

[Chorus]
And I've been pulling you close, but pushing me further
I've been holdin' it back that I see you're different
Sick of me reminding you
To love me like you say you do, oh, oh
And I've been hurtin' myself to keep you from leavin'
I've been wondering whether we'll last the season
Wish we could've made this work
But now I know that I need more
And I need more
And I need more
And I need more

[Outro]
And I need more
I need more3Embed
