37 ContributorsThe Sweetest Taboo Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I tell you, if I tell you now
Will you keep on, will you keep on loving me?
If I tell you, if I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me?

[Chorus]
You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo
You give me, you're giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

[Verse 2]
There's a quiet storm and it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm that is you
There's a quiet storm and it never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo
(Sometimes I think you're just too good for me)

[Chorus]
You give me the sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you (with you)
You give me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me
(Sometimes I think you're just too good for me)

[Verse 3]
I'd do anything for you, I'd stand out in the rain
Anything you want me to do, don't let it slip away
There's a quiet storm and it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm, I think it's you
There's a quiet storm and I never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo
You might also like[Chorus]
You give me the (you give me, you give me the) sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you (with you)
You give me, keep giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

[Outro]
You've got the biggest heart
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me
Every day is Christmas, and every night is New Year's Eve
Will you keep on loving me
Will you keep on, will you keep on
Bringing out the best in me15Embed
