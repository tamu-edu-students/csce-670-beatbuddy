75 ContributorsHappy Pills Lyrics[Chorus]
I take my pills and I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I love my girl but she ain't worth the price
She ain't worth the price
No, she ain't worth the price

[Verse 1]
We can go to my house if you wanna
Hang out in my bedroom, lose your honor
Even if they find us, we're apathetic
And they can't take that away

[Chorus]
I take my pills and I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I love my girl but she ain't worth the price
She ain't worth the price
No, she ain't worth the price

[Verse 2]
The voices in my right brain are kinda funny
They tell me "take a deep breath, it's always sunny"
But where I leave the lights on
It's so obvious that my life's pretty plain
You might also like[Chorus]
I take my pills and I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I love my girl but she ain't worth the price
She ain't worth the price
No, she ain't worth the price

[Bridge]
We take strange things to feel normal
We take strange things to feel normal
We take strange things to feel normal
To feel normal, to feel normal

[Chorus]
I take my pills and I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I love my girl but she ain't worth the price
She ain't worth the price
No, she ain't worth the price35Embed
