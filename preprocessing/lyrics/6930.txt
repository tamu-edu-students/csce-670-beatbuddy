13 ContributorsHang On to Your Love Lyrics[Chorus]
In Heaven's name, why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love
In Heaven's name, why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love

[Verse 1]
Take time if you're down on luck
It's so easy to walk out on love
Take your time if the going gets tough
It's so precious

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you want it to get stronger
You'd better not let go
You gotta hold on longer
If you want your love to grow
Gotta stick together
Hand in glove
Hold tight, don't fight
Hang on to your love

[Chorus]
In Heaven's name, why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love
In Heaven's name, why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love

You'd better not let go
You gotta hold on longer
If you want your love to grow

Hand in glove
Hold tight, don't fight
Hang on to your love

[Chorus]
In Heaven's name, why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love
In Heaven's name, why do you play these games?
