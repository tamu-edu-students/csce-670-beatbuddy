10 ContributorsCan’t Stop Lovin’ You Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a time and place for everything, for everyone
We can push with all our might, but nothing's gonna come
Oh no, nothing's gonna change
And if I asked you not to try, oh, could you let it be?

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hold you and say
We can't throw this all away
Tell me you won't go, you won't go
Do you have to hear me say

[Chorus]
I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what I say or do
You know my heart is true, oh
I can't stop lovin' you

[Verse 2]
You can change your friends, your place in life
You can change your mind
We can change the things we say
And do it anytime
Oh no, but I think you'll find
That when you look inside your heart
Oh, baby, I'll be there, yeah
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on
I'm holding on
Baby, just come on, come on, come on
I just wanna hear you say

[Chorus]
I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what you say or do
You know my heart is true, oh
I can't stop lovin' you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I'm so twisted and tied
And all I remember
Was how hard we tried
Only to surrender

[Bridge]
And when it's over
I know how it's gonna be
And true love will never die
No, not fade away

[Chorus]
And I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what I say or do
You know my heart is true, oh
I can't stop lovin' you
And I know what I got to do
Hey Ray, what you said is true, oh
I can't stop lovin' you, oh
Oh, I can't stop lovin' you3Embed
