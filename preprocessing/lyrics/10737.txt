Dare to imagine
Dare to believe in
A true love that gave us
A brand new beginning

[Refrain: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
No room for a king
No celebration and no ceremony
In that little town, no, nobody would think
This is the story of the coming glory

[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone, Joel & Luke Smallbone]
Can you hear the prayers that people prayed?
Can you see the skies begin to break?
When Heaven and Earth were face to face
Oh, how the world forever changed

[Chorus: Joel Smallbone, Joel & Luke Smallbone]
For God is with us
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
God is with us
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Luke Smallbone]
All in a moment
All in an instant
The body was broken
And it was finishеd
You might also like[Refrain: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
So let us begin
The cеlebration and the ceremony
There's silence on Earth, but the Heavens are roarin'
Tellin' the story of the coming glory

[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone, Joel & Luke Smallbone]
Can you feel your heart begin to race?
Can you see the tide begin to change?
With all of our futures rearranged
The world will never be the same

[Chorus: Joel Smallbone, Joel & Luke Smallbone]
For God is with us
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
God is with us
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Joel Smallbone, Luke Smallbone, Joel Smallbone & Luke Smallbone]
For God is with us
Oh, can we see, oh, can we see? (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Oh, can we hear, oh, can we hear? (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
For God is with us

[Verse 3: Joel Smallbone]
Dare to imagine
Dare to believe in
A true love that gave us
A reason for living
[Pre-Chorus 3: Joel Smallbone, Joel Smallbone & Choir, Joel & Luke Smallbone]
Can you feel the hope that's rushin' in?
Can you hear the song that's echoin'?
Join with the choir as we sing
This is where love truly begins
