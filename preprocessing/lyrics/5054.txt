Gunter glieben glauchen globen

[Intro]
Hm hm hm, tsk, tsk, tsk
All right, yeah
I got something to say
Yeah, it's better to burn out
Yeah, than fade away
All right
Ow
Gonna start a fire
C'mon

[Verse 1]
Rise up, gather round
Rock this place to the ground
Burn it up, let's go for broke
Watch the night go up in smoke

[Verse 2]
Rock on (Rock on)
Drive me crazier
No serenade, no fire brigade
Just the pyromania, come on

So feel it, don't fight it, go with the flow
And gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme one more for the road, yeah
