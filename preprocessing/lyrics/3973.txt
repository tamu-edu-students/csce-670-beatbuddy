20 ContributorsLost in the Wild Lyrics[Verse 1]
Eyelids split at sunrise
Morning breaks like splatter paint
Wipe the dust from my eyes
You must have left before morning came
Flashes of the night come rushing in
In a stampede of misbehaviors
Just a sophomore, running my mouth
I really thought that I could save us

[Chorus]
And we're only animals
Didn't mean to start a forest fire
Brush the ashes off your shoulders
Let's get lost in the wild
We're all built for something
Trying to find the starting line
Don't look over your shoulder
Let's get lost in the wild
Let's get lost in the wild
Let's get lost in the wild

[Verse 2]
Something shocks my muscles
Hard rain backhands my senses
Now I'm flying fast on my feet
I'm skipping rivers, clearing them fences
I'm tracking you into the city
Under the pressure of the traffic lights
I'm chasing the clues you left me
That you might still join me in the wild
You might also likeScratches on my hands and feet
You belong out here with me
Tearing up my my hands and feet
You belong out here with me
You belong out here with me
[Outro: In My Mind Piano Acoustic]
What if nothing went along
What if nothing died young
What if nothing was enough to never give up
Maybe none of this is real
Maybe I can wake up
Maybe then, oh

In my mind
You won't be in my mind, oh
In my mind
You won't be in my mind
In my mind5Embed
