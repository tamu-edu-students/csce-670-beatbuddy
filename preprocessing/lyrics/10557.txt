[Verse 1]
Got you off
No ya don’t tell me that you need me
You’re a molotov, got me at third degree, I’m patient
Yeah you’ve burned it all, and yeah you burned it all
It’s like a burn without a scar, now imma show it off, show it off, yeah

I don’t know why, I feel like I failed ya
All these emotions you know I can’t do
I guess I just gotta be cool without you
