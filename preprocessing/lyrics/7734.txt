Too many slaves in this world
Die by torture and pain
Too many people do not see
They're killing themselves, going insane
Too many people do not know
Bondage is over the human race
They believe slaves always lose
And this fear keeps them down

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch the damned (God bless ya!)
They're gonna break their chains (Hey!)
No, you can't stop them (God bless ya!)
They're coming to get you and then

[Chorus]
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall!
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
Balls to the wall

[Verse 2]
You may screw their brains
You may sacrifice them too
You may mortify their flesh
You may rape them all
One day the tortured will stand up
And revolt against the evil
They'll make you drink your blood
And tear yourself to pieces

They're gonna break their chains (Hey!)

[Chorus]
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall!

[Bridge]
(Balls to the wall, balls to the wall)
(Balls to the wall, balls to the wall)
Come on man, let's stand up all over the world
(Balls to the wall, balls to the wall)
Let's plug a bomb in everyone's ass (Balls to the wall)
They don't keep us alive (Balls to the wall)
We're gonna fight for the rights (Balls to the wall)
Build a wall with the bodies of the dead (Balls to the wall)
And you're saved (Balls to the wall)
Make the world scared (Balls to the wall)
Come on, show me the sign of victory
Sign of victory
Sign of victory
