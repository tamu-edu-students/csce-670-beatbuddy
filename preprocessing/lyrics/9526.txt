Going to leave you in disgrace
Nothing in my favour
Got the wind in my face
I'm going home
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

Can't get enough of sweet cocaine
Get enough of Mary Jane
Going back to where I come from
Going to roll 'em back home again
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

I've been worried about my babies
Been worried about my wife
There's just one place for a man to be
When he's worried about his life
I'm going home
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
You might also likeWell, I'm going away to leave you
Going to leave you in disgrace
I got nothing in my favour
The rain in my face
I'm going home
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hillEmbed
