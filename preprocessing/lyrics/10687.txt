Wait a minute

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait a minute, where I know you from?
Wait a minute, where I know you from?
Wait a minute, where I know you from?
Wait a minute, where I know you from?
From, from, from, from

Yo, we can get up outta here and go and have some fun
But first, you gotta tell me where I know you from

[Post-Chorus]

Something about you got me trippin', huh?
Wait a minute, where I know you from?
What's up, how you doin', love?
