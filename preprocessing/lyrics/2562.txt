15 Contributors​i don’t want to watch the world end with someone else Lyrics[Verse 1]
Empty streets now, where we used to love
Our hearts out but now I'm dancin' all alone
Scared to go out on my own
This calmin' feeling faded into anxious breathin'
In the places we were happy once
Stuck inside but never home

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I lose it all, in the blink of an eye
Like a fire burnin' out in the night
And my hearts stops beatin'
But something's screamin'

[Chorus]
And I, wish we didn't say goodbye
'Cause we're just standin' still
And I don't really know, what tomorrow holds
But I've, I've finally realized
If this is our last goodbye until we're gone
Who cares about the wrongs we caused ourselves
'Cause I don't want to watch the world end with someone else

[Verse 2]
Fallin' deeper, deeper into hopeless thinkin'
Remember when you pulled me out
Wishin' you would come around again
When the room goes quiet
I'm hit with my regret like a riot
Reminds me what I really want
But have I waited for too long?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if I lose it all, in the blink of an eye
Like a fire burnin' out in the night
And my hearts stops beatin'
But something's screamin'

[Chorus]
And I, I wish we didn't say goodbye
'Cause we're just standin' still
And I don't really know, what tomorrow holds
But I've, I've finally realized
If this is our last goodbye until we're gone
Who cares about the wrongs we caused ourselves
'Cause I don't want to watch the world end with someone else

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
World end with someone else
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
World end with someone else
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
World end with someone else
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
World end with someone else6Embed
