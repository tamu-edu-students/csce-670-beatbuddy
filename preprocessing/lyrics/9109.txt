Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama
Wearing your heart like a stolen dream
Opening skies with your broken keys
No one can blind us any longer

[Chorus: Matthew Koma]
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
[Verse 2: Matthew Koma]
Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama
Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama
Wearing your heart like a stolen dream
Opening skies with your broken keys
No one can blind us any longer

We'll run where lights won't chase us
