Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through, to, to, to
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
