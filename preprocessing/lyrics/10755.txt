I'm so sorry that you have to have a body
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body, oh yeah
I'm very sorry that you have to have a body

[Verse 1]
One that will hurt you and be the subject of so much of your fear
It will betray you
Be used against you
Then it will fail on you, my dear
But before that, you'll be a doormat
For every vicious narcissist in the world
Oh, how they'll screw you all up and over
Then feed you silence for dessert

[Chorus]
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body
So very sorry that you have to have a body, oh yeah
I'm sorry that you have to have a body

[Verse 2]
Filled with infection
One hundred scabs
Singing in unison
Eyes and hands
Sometimes bullets
Uninvited
Passing through us
Uninvited
Passing through us

[Outro]
I'm sorry that you have to have a body
I'm so sorry that you have to have a bodyYou might also like7Embed
