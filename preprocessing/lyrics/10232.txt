7 ContributorsAfraid Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've spent the last two years of my life
Tryna find a way back
I've been looking in the mirror
And tryin' to face facts

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I never thought that I'd be hurting
And I never thought that you deserved it
It's not as if the world stopped turnin'
So what am I afraid of?

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of the night, afraid of it all
Afraid it won't stop me 'cause you were my rock
Afraid I won't feel this with somebody else
Oh, what hurts the most
Is I'm afraid of myself

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm afraid of myself
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I'll spend the next two years of my life
Tryna find the right path
And if it takes me where I wanna go
I won't ever look back

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I never thought that I'd be hurting (No, no)
And I never thought that you deserved it
It's not as if the world stopped turnin' (World stopped turnin')
So what am I afraid of?

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of the night, afraid of it all
Afraid it won't stop me 'cause you were my rock
Afraid I won't feel this with somebody else
Oh, what hurts the most
Is I'm afraid of myself

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm afraid of myself
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (I'm afraid of myself)
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Outro]
I'm afraid of the night, afraid of it all
Afraid it won't stop me 'cause you were my rock
Afraid I won't feel this with somebody else
Oh, what hurts the most
Is I'm afraid of myself14Embed
