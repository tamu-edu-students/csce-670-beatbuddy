17 ContributorsI Choose You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let the bough break, let it come down crashin'
Let the sun fade out to a dark sky
I can't say I'd even notice it was absent
'Cause I could live by the light in your eyes
I'll unfold before you
Would have strung together
The very first words of a lifelong love letter

[Chorus]
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose you
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose you
I choose you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
There was a time when I would have believed them
If they told me you could not come true
Just love's illusion
But then you found me and everything changed
And I believe in something again
My whole heart
Will be yours forever
This is a beautiful start
To a lifelong love letter

Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose you (I choose you, I do)
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose you (I choose you, I choose)
I choose you (I choose you)

[Bridge]
We are not perfect
We'll learn from our mistakes
And as long as it takes
I will prove my love to you
I am not scared of the elements
I am underprepared, but I am willing
And even better
I get to be the other half of you

[Chorus]
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose you, yeah (I choose you, I do)
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose you (I choose you, I do)
I choose you (I choose you, I do)
I choose you (I choose you)18Embed
