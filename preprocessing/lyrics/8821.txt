3 ContributorsMiracle in the middle of my heart LyricsIn this lovely town, I meet your hand
Across the sun and above the clouds
The sky is clear, this day will be fine
To make you a lover worthy of the name
Save me, before you
A miracle can happen too
And so-ooo, be careful
I've a miracle in the middle of my heart

Miracle
In the mid of my heart
(Miracle, miracle, miracle)

(The sky is clear, this day will be fine)
To make you a lover worthy of the name (Oh yeah)
Save me, before you  (Oh yeah, Oh yeah)
A miracle can happen too (Oh yeah, Oh yeah)
Oh yeah
And so-ooo, be careful (Oh yeah, Oh yeah)
Oh yeah
I've a miracle in the middle of my heart (Oh yeah, Oh yeah)
Oh yeah, oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh yeah
Save me, before you (Oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah)
A miracle can happen too (Oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah)
And so-ooo, be careful (Oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah)
I've a miracle in the middle of my heart (Oh oh yeah, oh)Embed
