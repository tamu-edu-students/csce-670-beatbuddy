21 ContributorsOcean Prime Lyrics[Intro]
Where we at with it?

[Verse]
We tuna melt all of the smelts and fillet the salmons (What else?)
Ocean prime with the Caesar salad but the dressin' Italian
Had to break out the real scales, took a day to count it (Uh-huh)
Plug out in St. Thomas, from the Virgin to the Cayman Islands
This yacht life is a blessin', flip-flops and my Nautica sweats
Got your bitch on her knees swabbin' the deck
Oyster Perpets, flood the yacht with baguettes
Submariner, what a sea-dweller, this is not a Patek
Pack got sent from overseas with a postcard
Drownin' in sin, life's a beach, need a coast guard
Great Lakes to the coast, activate the alarm
Now we dockin' the boat, big rope with the anchor charms
Simply straight return, three-thousand miles away from home
Middle of the ocean, had to cut the navigation on
Nautica Competition accomplished on my windbreakers
Settin' sail, takin' Dramamine, I get seasick
Papa was a ladies' man, Popeye was a sailor man
Jewelry clearly Canadian, diamonds water, aquarium
Fish scale professional, we got that oil sheen, yeah
On the river tryna water wing me up a stingray
We got the same guns the Navy got, why panic?
Why these loose lips sinkin' ships like the Titanic?
On a deserted island, plug tried to leave me stranded
I can't understand his Inglés, he can't understand my Spanish
Big fish in a small pond full of guppies
Like The Bermuda Triangle I can make you vanish
Burnin' exotic coral reefer with all my blooders
The chain a treasure chest, but my piece hit like watercolors
