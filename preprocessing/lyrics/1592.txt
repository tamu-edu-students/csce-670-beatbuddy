California dreamin'
On such a winter's day

[Chorus/Drop]
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A
California dreamin'
On such a winter's day

[Verse 1]
Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees (Got down on my knees)
And I pretend to pray (I pretend to pray)
You know the preacher lights the coals (Preacher lights the coals)
He knows I'm gonna stay (Knows I'm gonna stay)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day

[Break]
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
If I didn't tell her
I could leave today
