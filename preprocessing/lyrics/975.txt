[Intro]
Snoop
Snoop

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at you
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed, 'cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I'm a nice dude (Uh), with some nice dreams (Yep)
See these ice cubes? (Uh) See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide-wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, tryna ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
*Ticks* You should think about it, take a second *Ding*
Matter-fact, you should take four, B
And think before you fuck with-a lil' Skateboard P

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at you
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed, 'cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a gangsta, but ch'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ *vinyl rewind*
(Two, re-pe-re-pe one, yep, three)
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live (So don't)
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack, now, ladies, here we gizzo
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at you
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed, 'cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a bad boy with a lotta hoes
Drive my own cars and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah, he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh, you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at you
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed, 'cause I got it goin' on
