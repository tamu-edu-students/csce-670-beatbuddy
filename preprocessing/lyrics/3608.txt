1 ContributorNights In White Satin - Single Version / Mono LyricsNights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed, with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore
'Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh, how I love you

Gazing at people, some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through, they can't understand
Some try to tell me, thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be, you will be in thе end
And I love you
Yes I lovе you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you

Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed, with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore
'Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you
You might also like'Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you

Breathe deep the gathering gloom
Watch lights fade from every room
Bed sitter people look back and lament
Another days useless energy spent
Impassioned lovers wrestle as one
Lonely man cries for love and has none
New mother picks up and suckles her son
Senior citizens wish they were young
Cold hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colors from our sight
Red is grey and yellow white
But we decide which is right
And which is an illusionEmbed
