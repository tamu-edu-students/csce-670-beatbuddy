6 ContributorsYou’re Free Lyrics[Intro]
'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your

[Verse 1]
Can't hear what you saying
The music's playing way too loud, all about that vibe, yeah
I'm down with the waiting
Yeah, I just wanna dance right now till my heels wear out

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me, give me all that I like
I've been waiting for this feeling that I'm feeling tonight
Hands up to the ceiling, so high, so high
Come on and try 'cause now's the time

[Chorus]
'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
Do what you want to do
You've got to live your

[Verse 2]
Don't care where we're going
I'm over bein' in control, gotta let it go
Just lose that attitude
You know, you know you got to lose that attitudе, yeah
