7 ContributorsDie by the Blade Lyrics[Verse 1]
In total absence of light
We meet again
Equal in strength
My nemesis, my only friend
Abysmal oceans roar
With immortal hate
Imbued with blistering rage
You will ride the wave

[Chorus]
Fight until you
Die by the blade of the one you hate
End of reason
End of the game
Die by the blade of the one you love to hate
With all your heart

[Verse 2]
Eviscerated soul
Maimed sanity
All sacrificed
To the eclipsed reality
The abhorrent beast
Has revealed its ugly face
You can smash all the mirrors
But there's only one true escape
You might also like[Chorus]
Fight until you
Die by the blade of the one you hate
End of reason
End of the game
Die by the blade of the one you love to hate
With all your heart

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Fight until you
Die by the blade of the one you hate
End of reason
End of the game
Die by the blade of the one you love to hate
With all your heart
Fight until you
Die by the blade of the one you hate
End of reason
End of the game
Die by the blade of the one you love to hate
With all your heart
Spill the vengeful blood
Screaming in the dark1Embed
