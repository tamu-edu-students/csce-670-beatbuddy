Your skin is warm like an oven
Your kiss is sugary sweet
Your fingers feel like cotton
When you put your arms around me
I feel like I'm just missin'
Somethin' whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients
Except you lovin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
And respectfully

[Chorus]
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm takin' back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night

[Verse 2]
You smell just like vanilla
You taste like buttercream
You're fillin' up my senses
With empty calories
I feel like I'm just missin'
Somethin' whenever you leave
You've got all the ingredients
Except you needin' me

[Bridge]
If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake (Cake)
Then you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me
If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake (Cake)
Then you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me

[Chorus]
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm takin' back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
The slice of heaven that I gave—
S-s-slice of heaven that I gave to you
Slice of heaven that I gave to you last night47Embed
