J-J-Jayyeah

[Chorus]
Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts
Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts

[Bridge]
Love now, cry later, cry later
But, I always take the chance
But, I always take the chance
If I could save her
If I could save her
She said she got other plans, damn

[Chorus]
Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts
Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurtsYou might also like29Embed
