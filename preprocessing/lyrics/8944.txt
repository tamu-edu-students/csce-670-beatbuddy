Fine lines
In the shape of you, slowly come to life
Mixed signs
Got me so confused, I see them all the time
Draw the line
Mesmerized
Mixed signs
I see them all the time

[Pre-Drop]
All the time
Mixed signs

[Drop]

[Post-Drop]
All the time

[Chorus]
Fine lines
In the shape of you
Come to life
Fine lines
In the shape of you
All the time
Fine lines
In the shape of you
Comе to life
Fine lines
In thе shape of you
I see them all the time
You might also like[Drop]

[Post-Drop]
All the time

[Bridge]
On and off again
Like cig' and whiskey never die
So paper-thin
Self-control is running wild

[Chorus]
Fine lines
In the shape of you, slowly come to life
Mixed signs
Got me so confused, I see them all the time

[Pre-Drop]
Draw the line
Mesmerized
Mixed signs
I see them all the time

[Drop]

[Post-Drop]
All the time
All the timeEmbed
