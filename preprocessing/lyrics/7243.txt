8 ContributorsSeasick Lyrics[Chorus]
Smoking and drinking surrounds me
But I feel it sinking it's in my dreams
This voice in my head poison Ivy -well I'm falling to pieces
Since about three or four in the evening
Same old story as dull as I'm speaking - you're in my dream
And please will you read this baby cause I'm seasick
I need an adhesive; tried to restick this

[Verse]
I used to write names on walls
I never really payed much thought
Who I made more distraught
Mom or dad, sunny bank where I was caught
Ought to not feel so muddled
Never had to  breathe the winds of the double
Cat caught the buggle
Mad all them holidays was rain in the summer police keep on knocking
On my door of my mothers
Them times when I was asleep and needin' of another cuddle
If I were in trouble
Call down from your window linked up maybe two or three night (yeah)
You're in my dream n'

[Verse 2]
Baby girl from la-la, land paved a way to, make the plan
Everything was meant to, be especially the stress-free way
Then I saw an angel form you like a mural by William Blakesville
Out here for all the steak all the pies all the belts and it's all that helps me
Get to sleep see all the fruit, look up at the grief
It's up to me it's up to you

Hoping and thinking whether I'll be worthy
I found a distinction tried to unearth me
These voice in my head they try to hurt me
So I rolled up both my sleeves and then they left me

[Chorus]
And why are you leavin' baby 'cause I'm Seasick
I need an adhesive; Tried to restick this
Voice in my head told me to leave it
But I'm so sorry to sleep in

[Bridge/outro]
Why are you leavin'
Please will you read this baby 'cause I'm seasick
Please will you read this baby 'cause I'm seasick
Please will you read this baby 'cause I'm seasick
Please will you read this baby 'cause I'm seasick
Please will you read this baby 'cause I'm seasick
Please will you read this baby 'cause I'm seasick

Pure voices: pure pure voices

Pure voices, pure voices: pure pure pure voice-
Pure voices, pure voices: pure pure pure voices
Seasick

As dull as I'm speakin'
You're in my dream andEmbed
