I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I picked you up when you
Fell and cut your knee
Told you not to cry and held you
Close to me

[Chorus: Blxst]
I hope I'm not too late
To set my demons straight
I know I made you wait
But how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me
I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Amanda Reifer]
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa puff
Serafina, flame in us
Where I'd be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you
Deep, I feel, deep, I feel (I know we're feelin' deep)
Deep, I feel, deep, too (I know we're feelin' too deep)
Deep, I feel, deep, I feel (I know we're feelin' deep)
Deep, I feel, deep, you (I know we're feelin')

Do you love me? Do you trust me?
Can I trust you? Don't judge me
I'ma die hard, it gets ugly
Too passionate, it gets ugly
Mmm, ah-ah
I wonder where I lost my way?
Mmm, ah-ah
Been waiting on your call all day
Tell me you in my corner right now
When I fall short, I'm leanin' on you to cry out
We all got enough to lie about
My truth too complicated to hide now
Can I open up? Is it safe or not?
I'm afraid a little, you relate or not?
Have faith a little, I might take my time
Ain't no savin' face this time

[Chorus: Blxst]
I hope I'm not too late
To set my demons straight
I know I made you wait
But how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me
I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me
Yeah
[Post-Chorus: Amanda Reifer]
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa puff
Serafina, flame in us
Where I'd be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you
Deep, I feel, deep, I feel (I know we're feelin' deep)
Deep, I feel, deep, too (I know we're feelin' too deep)
Deep, I feel, deep, I feel (I know we're feelin' deep)
Deep, I feel, deep, you (I know we're feelin')

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I got some regrets
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
But my past won't keep me from my best
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Subtle mistakes felt like life or death
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I wanna see the family stronger
I wanna see the money longer
You know that I'd die for you
I get emotional about life
The lost ones keepin' me up at night
The world be reminding me it's danger
I'll still risk it all for a stranger
If I told you who I am, would you use it against me?
Right or wrong, no stone, just love to send me
[Chorus: Blxst]
I hope I'm not too late
To set my demons straight
I know I made you wait
But how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me
I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me
Yeah

[Outro: Blxst]
Baby, you make me
Pray for London
Yeah
'Cause if I won it all without you involved
(Fucking love you)
I guess it's all for nothing48Embed
