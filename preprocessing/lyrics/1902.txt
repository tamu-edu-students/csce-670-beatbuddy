23 ContributorsNot Another Rockstar Lyrics[Intro]
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"

[Verse 1]
Pinky promised I was quittin'
Pinky promised that I wouldn't love somebody if they didn't
I'm a girl with big ambitions, but did I listen?
No, no, no, no
They're tortured and I wouldn't understand it
Plus they got a lot of unexamined father-son baggage
They don't wanna talk about it, is that a challenge?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny I could pick 'em in a line up, line up
Pretty certain I could do it with my eyes shut, eyes shut
A little self-obsеssive and I sign up, sign up
Ooh

[Chorus]
Hand me down jewеls and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"

He's been a player since the cradle
Aren't I lucky 'cause he could have chosen any girl to fuck with?
And he chose me, so I guess I should be grateful
No, no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Hmm, funny I could pick 'em in a line up, line up
Pretty certain I could do it with my eyes shut, eyes shut
A little self-obsessive and I sign up, sign up
Where's the pen? Where's the line?

[Chorus]
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"

[Bridge]
Ooh, not another rockstar
Ooh, not another rockstar
Glad that I got out before it got dark
You could be a better person, no, it's not hard
If there was a moment in this where you saw it goin' different, tell me what part
[Chorus]
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"Embed
