Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me

[Verse 2]
This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now my love, right now
There'll be no other time
And I can show you how, my love

[Verse 3]
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me

[Pre-Chorus]
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

[Chorus]
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

[Chorus]
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away

[Outro]
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away1Embed
