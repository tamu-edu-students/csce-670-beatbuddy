Lil Tjay
Nagra
Yeah

[Chorus]
I think it's time to shine, I've been waitin' so long
Broski servin' time, he been gone for so long
And I promise I'ma do this shit for us, just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
In the telly sippin' Henny and I got my robe on
And they know I'm throwin' bullets, tell the opps to go long
They weren't ready for that last year, told us, "Hold on"
Bro gone, ain't no chill button, we gon' go strong

[Verse 1]
Hoppin' out, I got a MAC
Hit and do the dash, celebrate and laugh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I ain't want for all this to get physical
Don't get left where they gotta come visit you
Gang, gang, call 'em out to extort you (Skrrt, skrrt)
Little more than one eighty, the Porsche do
Tjay shining 'cause I can afford to
I'm a stain, so I gotta' move cautious
Happy I'm livin' the life I was given
Now we ain't shakin', don't think that I'm slippin'
I pull up, I'm grippin', still makin' my chicken
You mad? My bad, Lil Tjay ain't trippin'
And they mad 'cause I'm stackin' my knots
And fuckin' they thots, yes, I'm still puttin' on for the block
Still on my way to the top
And I'm still here to prove, 'cause my hunger ain't never gon' stop
Trauma that's fucked with my mind
Ain't wastin' no time, I'm focused on betterin' mine
Bullets gon' wet up your spine
Throwin' shots from behind, Lil Tjay you one of a kind
It's the reason I gotta go off
Take your moms out the hood, it don't matter the cost
Seventeen, life is short, but I'm rich and a boss (Yeah, yeah)
See, the haters is mad 'cause they hate how I floss (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I think it's time to shine, I've been waitin' so long
Broski servin' time, he been gone for so long
And I promise I'ma do this shit for us, just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
In the telly sippin' Henny and I got my robe on
And they know I'm throwin' bullets, tell the opps to go long
They weren't ready for that last year, told us, "Hold on"
Bro gone, ain't no chill button, we gon' go strong

[Verse 2]
Bro gone
Bodies drop all the time and I'm still finna kill some
Run up on me and that steel drummin'
All my life I've been hungry, that meal comin'
Me and my niggas must get it, no credit
We tryna see commas on debit
I tell my niggas, "We all gon' be fine, I promise, remember I said it"
Hop in the foreign, switch lanes (Switch)
I took of the brain for all them nights we went through pain
Drippy, I'm makin' it rain
Lil Tjay my name, you see what it say on the chain
I've been doin' my own thing
When it come to that money, I flip it like cocaine
She eat up and get protein
I just hit it and dump it, no cuffin' her, no games (No games)
I be shittin' with no shame
And I've been was that nigga 'fore rappin' with no chain
Where I come from, they tote thangs
Lil' niggas out buckin', they shooting with no aim (No aim)
You ain't ever put in no pain
How the fuck you gon' tell on your homie? That's so lame (So lame)
I don't ever say no names
So my goal is to get to the top with the whole gang (Gang, gang, gang)
[Chorus]
I think it's time to shine, I've been waitin' so long
Broski servin' time, he been gone for so long
And I promise I'ma do this shit for us, just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
In the telly sippin' Henny and I got my robe on
And they know I'm throwin' bullets, tell the opps to go long
They weren't ready for that last year, told us, "Hold on"
Bro gone, ain't no chill button, we gon' go strong

[Outro]
