I am, I am what they left
I'm all the rest of what they stole
A town hidden at the top
My skin is made of leather so it endures every weather
I'm a smoke factory
Peasants labor for your consumption
Cold front in the middle of summer
Love in the time of cholera, my brother
I am the sun that is born and the day that dies
With the best sunsets
I am raw development
A political speech without saliva
The most beautiful faces I've met
I am the photograph of a missing person
The blood inside your veins
I am a piece of land that's worthwhile
A basket with beans
I'm Maradona against England scoring two goals
I am what holds my flag
The world's backbone is my mountain range
I am what my father taught me:
"He who does not love his homeland, does not love his mother"
I am Latin America
A nation without legs, but that walks (Hey!)

You can't buy the wind
You can't buy the sun
You can't buy the rain
You can't buy the heat
You can't buy the clouds
You can't buy colors
You can't buy my happiness
You can't buy my sorrows

You can't buy the wind
You can't buy the sun
You can't buy the rain
You can't buy the heat
You can't buy the clouds
You can't buy colors
You can't buy my happiness
You can't buy my sorrows

[Verse 2: Residente, Calle 13]
I have the lakes, I have the rivers
I have my teeth for when I smile
The snow that paints my mountains
I have the sun that dries me and the rain that showers me
A dessert drunk with peyote
A shot of pulque to sing with coyotes
Everything I need
I've got my lungs breathing clear blue
The height that suffocates
I'm the tooth of my mouth chewing coca
The autumn with its fainted leaves
The verses written under the starry night
A vineyard full of grapes
A reed under the sun in Cuba
I'm the Caribbean Sea that watches over the houses
Performing rituals of holy water
The wind that brushes my hair
I am all the saints that hang from my neck
The juice of my struggle is not artificial
Because my land's fertilizer is natural
[Chorus: Totó la Momposina, Susana Baca & Maria Rita]
You can't buy the wind
You can't buy the sun
You can't buy the rain
You can't buy the heat
You can't buy the clouds
You can't buy colors
You can't buy my happiness
You can't buy my sorrows

You can't buy the wind
You can't buy the sun
You can't buy the rain
You can't buy the heat
You can't buy the clouds
You can't buy colors
You can't buy my happiness
You can't buy my sorrows

You can't buy the sun
You can't buy the rain
(We go walking)
(In laughter and in love)
(We go walking)
(In tears and in pain)
(We go drawing the path)
You can't buy my life
The land is not for sale
[Verse 3: Residente, Calle 13]
I work rough, but with pride
Here we share, what's mine is yours
This nation does not drown with the waves
And if it crumbles down I rebuild it
Neither do I blink when I look at you
So you remember my last name
"Operación cóndor" invading my nest
I forgive, but never forget! (Hey!)

[Outro: Susana Baca, Maria Rita & Totó la Momposina]
(We go walking)
Here we breathe fight
(We go walking)
I sing to be listened to
(We go drawing the path)
(Voices of one heart)
(We go walking)
Here we are standing
Long live The Americas!
You can't buy my life1Embed
