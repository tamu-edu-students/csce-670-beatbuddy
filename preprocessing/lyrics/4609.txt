19 ContributorsBound for the Floor Lyrics[Verse 1]
Born to be down
I've learned all my lessons before now
Born to be down
I think you'll get used to it

[Pre-Chorus]
And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic
And you learn to accept it, you know it's so pathetic
And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic
And you learn to accept it, you know it's so pathetic

[Chorus]
And you don't
And you don't
And you don't
And you don't

And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic
And you learn to accept it, you know it's so pathetic
And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic
And you learn to accept it, you know it's so pathetic
