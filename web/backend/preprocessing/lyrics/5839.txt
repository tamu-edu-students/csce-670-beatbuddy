4 ContributorsParty in my Head LyricsI've been staring at the wall
And trying not to lose my head
I can feel the insanity is not too far away
It’s been knocking me dead

We're going back to the ice age
And not like we did before
I'm trapped in this cage, I’ve got an itch that can't be cured
It's calling me out

There's a party in my head, woah ohh
We're all locked up
We're all shut down
There's a party in my head, woah ohh
I can't get enough and I never wanna stop

We’re all living on the edge
I smoke away my pain
A lot of testosterone that’s boiling in my veins
It's floating away

We’re all living like animals
It's a new way of life
I can't shut down the voices that are screaming in my brain
And it's calling my name

We're all locked up
We're all shut down
There's a party in my head, woah ohh
I can't get enough and I never wanna stop

Hey, this is the end
Don't try to lock me down

There's a party in my head, woah ohh
We're all fucked up
We're all shut down
There's a party in my head, woah ohh
We can't get enough and we never wanna stop

There's a party in my head, woah oh ohh
You're all invited
You're all my friends
There's a party in my head, woah ohh
We can't get enough and we never wanna stop
There's a party in my head, woah ohh
There's a party in my head, woah oh ohh
There's a party in my head, woah ohh1Embed
