All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby

[KATHERINE HOWARD]
(spoken)
I think we can all agree I'm the ten amongst these threes

[ENSEMBLE]
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby

[KATHERINE HOWARD]
(spoken)
And ever since I was a child, I'd make the boys go wild

[ENSEMBLE]
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby

[KATHERINE HOWARD, spoken]
(spoken)
Take my first music teacher, Henry Mannox
I was young, it's true
But even then, I knew
(sung)
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
You might also likeBroad, dark, sexy Mannox
Taught me all about dynamics
He was twenty-three
And I was thirteen, going on thirty
We spent hours strumming the lute
Striking the chords and blowing the flute
He plucked my strings all the way to G
Went from major to minor, C to D
Tell me what you need
What you want, you don't need to plead
'Cause I feel the chemistry
Like I get you and you get me
And maybe this is it
He just cares so much, it feels legit
We have a connection
I think this guy is different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, love me, can't get enough, see
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is please me, squeeze me, birds and the bees me
Run your fingers through my hair
Tell me I'm the fairest of the fair
Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
(spoken)
But then there was another guy, Francis Dereham

(sung)
Serious, stern and slow
Gets what he wants and he won't take no
Passion in all that he touches
The sexy secretary to the dowager duchess
Helped him in his office, had a duty to fulfill
He even let me use his favorite quill
Spilled ink all over the parchment
My wrist was so tired
Still, I came back the next day as he required
You say, I'm all you need
All you want, you don't need to plead
'Cause I feel the chemistry
Like I get you and you get me
And I know this is it
He just cares so much, this one's legit
We have a real connection
I'm sure this time is different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, love me, can't get enough, see
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is please me, squeeze me, birds and the bees me
You can't wait a second more
To get my corset on the floor
Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
(spoken)
Yeah, that didn't work out
So I decided to have a break from boys
And you'll never guess who I met!

(sung)
Tall, large, Henry VIII
Supreme head of the Church of England
Globally revered
Although you wouldn't know it from the look of that beard
Made me a lady-in-waiting, held
Me and my family up in the world
Gave me duties in court and he swears it's true
That, without me, he doesn't know what he'd do
You say, I'm all you need
All you want, we both agree
This is the place for me
I'm finally where I'm meant to be
Then he starts saying all this stuff
He cares so much, he calls me "Love"
He says we have this connection
I guess it's not so different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, love me, can't get enough, see
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is seize me, squeeze me, birds and the bees me
There's no time for when or how
'Cause you've just got to have me now
Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah

(spoken)
So we got married. .. . . woo!

(sung)
With Henry, it isn't easy
His temper's short and his mates are sleazy
Except for this one courtier
He's a really nice guy, just so sincere
The royal life isn't what I planned
But Thomas is there to lend a helping hand
So sweet, makes sure that I'm okay
And we hang out loads when the King's away
This guy, finally
Is what I want, the friend I need
Just mates, no chemistry
I get him and he gets me
And there's nothing more to it
He just cares so much, he's devoted
He says we have a connection
I thought this time was different
Why did I think he'd be different?
But it's never, ever different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, when will enough be enough, see?
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is squeeze me, don't care if you don't please me
Bite my lip and pull my hair
As you tell me I'm the fairest of the fair

[ENSEMBLE]
Playtime's over
Playtime's over

[KATHERINE HOWARD & ENSEMBLE]
Playtime's over
The only thing, the only thing...

[KATHERINE HOWARD]
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah…ha..19Embed All You Wanna Do Six: The Musical (Studio Cast Recording) SIX;Aimie Atkinson show-tunes
