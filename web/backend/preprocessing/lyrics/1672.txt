29 ContributorsOcean Avenue Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a place off Ocean Avenue
Where I used to sit and talk with you
We were both sixteen and it felt so right
Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night
Stayin' up all night

[Verse 2]
There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street
We would walk on the beach in our bare feet
We were both eighteen and it felt so right
Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night
Stayin' up all night

[Chorus]
If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

[Verse 3]
There's a piece of you that's here with me
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see
When I sleep, I dream, and it gets me by
I can make-believe that you're here tonight
That you're here tonight

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

[Bridge]
I remember the look in your eyes
When I told you that this was goodbye
You were beggin' me, not tonight
Not here, not now
We're looking up at the same night sky (Ooh)
And keep pretendin' the sun will not rise (Ooh)
We'll be together for one more night (Ooh)
Somewhere, somehow

[Chorus]
If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away18Embed
