Ayy, ayy
Fed up, I'm fed up, ayy, ayy, ayy
Fed up, I'm fed up, ayy
Fed up, I'm fed up, ayy
Fed up, I'm fed up, ayy, ayy
Fed up, I'm fed up, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Fed up, I'm fed up
Fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up
Fed up, I'm fed up
Fed up, fed up, fed up, I'm fed up
Fed up, I'm fed up with the drugs
Fed up with the fake love, put the gun to my brain, go bang
I'm fed up with the drama
Got a crib for my momma 'cause I don't think I'ma live too much longer
I'm fed up
Fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up
Fed up, I'm fed up
Fed up, fed up, fed up, I'm fed up
Fed up, I'm fed up with the drugs
Fed up with the fake love, put the gun to my brain, go bang
I'm fed up with the drama
Got a crib for my momma 'cause I don't think I'ma live too much longer
You might also like[Verse 1]
I'm fed up with the fame
I'm sick of reading my name in any other way than I intended
Fed up with all of these motherfuckers misunderstandin' me
I'm fed up with the ones that try to say you a fan of me
But then they turn their back and mothafuckers abandon me
You think I'm sitting high with everything, but now can't you see?
I'm livin' in reality, a struggle, not fantasy
I'm in a million-dollar couch, back then I was in a van

[Bridge]
(A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.)

[Verse 2]
Wind up in the wrong mindset
Might've wound up with the wrong set of friends
On a benzo bender withdrawal, never go back, no
Say a prayer to someone who cares
Ain't nobody listenin', or they left you on read again
Never again will I put my faith in a religion
No God or Satan gonna make me understand I'm dealt a bad hand

[Chorus]
Fed up, I'm fed up
Fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up
Fed up, I'm fed up
Fed up, fed up, fed up, I'm fed up
Fed up, I'm fed up with the drugs
Fed up with the fake love, put the gun to my brain, go bang
I'm fed up with the drama
Got a crib for my momma 'cause I don't think I'ma live too much longer
I'm fed up
Fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up
Fed up, I'm fed up
Fed up, fed up, fed up, I'm fed up
Fed up, I'm fed up with the drugs
Fed up with the fake love, put the gun to my brain, go bang
I'm fed up with the drama
Got a crib for my momma 'cause I don't think I'ma live too much longer, I'm22Embed
