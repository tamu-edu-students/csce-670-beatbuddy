[Verse 1]
Well she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams
And-a, fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

[Verse 2]
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, she said, it's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything, anything
Fly on, little wing

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, little wingYou might also like43Embed Little Wing Axis: Bold As Love Jimi Hendrix hard-rock
