Ah, now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
Crimson and clover
Ah, I wish she'd come walking over
Now I've been waiting to show her
Crimson and clover
Over and over

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Yeah (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
My my, such a sweet thing (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
I wanna do everything (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
What a beautiful feeling (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Crimson and clover (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Over and over

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
