11 ContributorsIn a Darkened Room LyricsIn a darkened room
Beyond the reach of God's faith
Lies the wounded
The shattered remains of love betrayed
And the innocence
Of a child is bought and sold
In the name of the damned
The rage of the angels left silent and cold

Forgive me please for I know not what I do
How can I keep inside the hurt I know is true

Tell me when the kiss
Of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear
Of running unto you
Please let there be light
In a darkened room

All the precious times
Have been put to rest again
And the smile of the dawn
Brings tainted lust singing my requiem
Can I face the day
When I'm tortured in my trust
And watch it crystalize
While my salvation it crumbles to dust

I've fallen to the sea but still I swim for shore

Tell me when the kiss
Of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear
Of running unto you
Please let there be light
