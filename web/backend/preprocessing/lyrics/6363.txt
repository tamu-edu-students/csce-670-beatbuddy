He knew what he wanted to say
But he didn't know how to word it
The dirty little Herbert was seeking an escape
But the place was well-guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

[Chorus: Helders & Turner]
'D' is for delightful and try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

[Verse 2: Helders, Turner, & Helders & Turner]
'D' is for desperately trying to simulate
What it was that was alright
Three quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
On the brink of a mission
And every other episode

[Bridge: Turner, & Turner & Helders]
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel—I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
