Gravity
Gravity
(Promise you'll stay strong)
And carry on
Carry on

[Verse 1]
I'm here to say goodbye
No spell or prayer you try
Will bring me back to life
(Don't follow me, follow me)
So look me in my eyes
Sing me lullabies
Hold me 'til it's time
(Don't follow me, follow me)

[Chorus]
Gravity
Don't mean that much to me
Now I'm floating near the atmosphere
No shackles on my feet
And I know I may be already gone
Just promise you'll stay strong
And carry on
Carry on

I miss the way it hurts
A blessing, it's a curse
For better or for worse
(Don't follow me, follow me)
Like a child, I have learned
Everybody waits their turn
Like a phoenix, I will burn
(Don't follow me, follow me)

[Verse 3]
Oh, this is it and I can feel my breath slowing
And my heart is beating weaker from the pain of not knowing
So kiss me on the face and wipe your tears from your eyes
'Cause this is goodbye
(Don't follow me, follow me)

[Chorus]
Gravity
Don't mean that much to me
Now I'm floating near the atmosphere
No shackles on my feet
And I know I may be already gone
Just promise you'll stay strong
And carry on
Carry on
[Bridge]
Who we are is determined by the scars
Death is like a one-way ticket to a distant star
All we are is a cosmic dust that scatters free
With no sense of direction, we're just wandering
Who we are is determined by the scars (We're wandering)
Death is like a one-way ticket to a distant star (We're wandering)
All we are is a cosmic dust that scatters free
With no sense of direction, we're just wandering
(We're just wandering)

[Chorus]
Gravity
Don't mean that much to me
Now I'm floating near the atmosphere
No shackles on my feet
And I know I may be already gone
Just promise you'll stay strong
And carry on

[Outro]
Gravity (We're wandering)
Gravity (We're wandering)
(I know I may be already gone)
We're wandering
We're just- we're just- we're just wandering
Who we are is determined by the scars (We're wandering)
Death is like a one-way ticket to a distant star (We're wandering)
All we are is a cosmic dust that scatters free (We're wandering)
With no sense of direction, we're just wandering1Embed
