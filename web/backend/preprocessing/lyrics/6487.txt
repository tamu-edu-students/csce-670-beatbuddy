17 ContributorsWalking Away Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away (I'm walking away) from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes, you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I truly realize
Some people don't wanna compromise
Well, I saw them with my own eyes
Spreading those lies, and
Well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

[Chorus]
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away

Well, I'm so tired, baby
Things you say, you're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room, baby
Don't listen to the games they play

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I thought you'd realize
I'm not like them other guys
'Cause I saw them with my own eyes
You should've been more wise, babe
Well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

[Chorus]
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (Oh I'm walking away, from the troubles in my life)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (I'm walking away, troubles in my life)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day (I'm walking away)
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (I'm walking away, I try to show you, baby)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh I'm gon', I'm gonna find a better day)
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (Oh yeah, from the troubles in my life, baby)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away8Embed
