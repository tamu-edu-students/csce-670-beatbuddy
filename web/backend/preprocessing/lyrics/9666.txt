10 ContributorsBridge Over Troubled Water Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
I'm on your side, oh when time gets rough
And friends just can't be found

[Chorus]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

[Verse 2]
When you're down and out, when you're on the streets
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you
I'll take your part, oh when darkness comes
And pain is all around

[Chorus]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

[Verse 3]
Sail on, silver girl, sail on by
Your time has come to shine, all your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, oh if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
You might also like[Chorus]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind..
I will ease your mind..2Embed
