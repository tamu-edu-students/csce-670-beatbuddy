Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap

[Verse 1]
Think I just remembered somethin'
I think I left the faucet runnin'
Now my words are fillin' up the tub
Darling, you're just soaking in it
But I know you'll get out the minute
You notice all your fingers prunin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of being careful, tiptoe
Trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh-oh, there it goes
I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?

[Chorus]
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

Think I got myself in trouble
So I'll fill the bath with bubbles
Then I'll put the towels all away
Should've never said the word "love"
Threw a toaster in the bathtub
I'm sick of all the games I have to play

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of being careful, tiptoe
Trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh-oh, there it goes
I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?

[Chorus]
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
[Chorus]
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash, wash, mouth, mouth with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap110Embed Soap Cry Baby (Deluxe Edition) Melanie Martinez electro
