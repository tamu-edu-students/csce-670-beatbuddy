17 ContributorsAlready Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would have worked out right
We were never meant for do or die

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I didn't want us to burn out, I
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop

[Chorus]
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, but someone's gotta go
And I want you to know, you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

[Verse 2]
Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss then we could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You know that I love you so
I love you enough to let you go
You might also like[Chorus]
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, but someone's gotta go
And I want you to know, you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone
So I'm already gone

[Bridge]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

[Chorus]
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, but someone's gotta go
And I want you to know, you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone
I'm already gone

[Outro]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye10Embed Already Gone Covers, Vol. 2 Sleeping At Last ambient
