Every time I look into your loving eyes
I see a love that money just can't buy
One look from you, I drift away
I pray that you are here to stay

[Chorus]
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

[Verse 2]
Every time I hold you, I begin to understand
Everything about you tells me I'm your man
I live my life to be with you
No one can do the things you do

[Chorus]
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby
Anything you want (You got it)
Anything you need (You got it)
Anything at all
You might also like[Bridge]
I'm glad to give my love to you
I know you feel the way I do

[Chorus]
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

[Outro]
Anything at all (You got it)
Baby
You got it6Embed
