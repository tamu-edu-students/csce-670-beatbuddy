21 ContributorsNever Going Back Lyrics[Intro]
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
Shrug us off our shoulders
We don't do what they told us
So I don't wanna be another face in the crowd
So I can't slow it down, no
So I can't slow it down, no
They write us off and say it's just another opinion
I'm tired of trying to fit in when I'm one in a million
So I can't slow it down, no
No, I can't slow it down, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna follow
Just because they say so
I'm never gonna let go, let go
Of this high

[Chorus]
I've already hit the low, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've already felt the cold, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm never giving up, never gonna crack
Never giving in, never going back
Already fell below, oh, oh, oh, oh
I fell deeper than the snow, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm never giving up, never gonna crack, I'm
Never giving in, never going back

Don't tell me that it's over when I'm just getting started
I'm done with waiting for them 'cause my ship has departed
And I can't slow it down, no
No I can't slow it down, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna follow
Just because they say so
I'm never gonna let go, let go
They won't win this fight

[Chorus]
I've already hit the low, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've already felt the cold, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm never giving up, never gonna crack
Never giving in, never going back
Already fell below, oh, oh, oh, oh
I fell deeper than the snow, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm never giving up, never gonna crack, I'm
Never giving in, never going back

[Bridge]
(Oh, oh)
Never giving up, never gonna crack (Oh)
I'm never giving in, never going back
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna follow
Just because they say so
I'm never gonna let go, let go

[Chorus]
Cause I've already hit the low, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've already felt the cold, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm never giving up, never gonna crack
Never giving in, never going back
Already fell below, oh, oh, oh, oh
I fell deeper than the snow, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm never giving up, never gonna crack, I'm
Never giving in, never going back

[Outro]
(Oh, oh)
Never giving up, never gonna crack (Oh)
I'm never giving in, never going back
(Oh, oh)
Never giving up, never gonna crack (Oh)
I'm never giving in, never going back5Embed
