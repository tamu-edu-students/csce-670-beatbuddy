6 ContributorsSummer Vibe Lyrics[Intro]
Baby, you're my summer vibe
Take your picture while we're bathing in the sum—

[Verse 1]
I've been on my own, yeah
Okay, it's been a week, I think it's overrated
I'm tired of the break, okay, I maybe hate it
I kinda just miss you (I kinda just miss you)
You got me in my zone, yeah
You got me in my feelings and I feel frustrated
I'm not that good at cookin', got my windows shaded
I kinda just miss you (I kinda just miss you)

[Pre-Chorus]
And all those ten mile road trips, baby, you're the best
You're a ten times ten times ten and I'm blessed
So let's ride 'til it's over
On this high 'til October
And we might just be sober
But with you I don't mind because

[Chorus]
Baby, you're my summer vibe
Take your picture while we're bathing in the summer light
If you want it, girl, I got it
Two's enough to party
Three o' clock is just the time to get the summer started, oh yeah
Baby, you're my summer vibe
Take your picture while we're wading in a summer tide
If you want it, girl, I got it
Two's enough to party
Three o' clock is just the time to get the summer started
You might also like[Verse 2]
Every single time
I'm lying in my bed, I got you on my mind
The way we toss and turn at least a hundred times and
I still kinda miss you, uh
So send me out a sign
I'm oversaturated with a cheap tan line
The park is kinda lame without your taste for wine and yeah
I still kinda miss all the things that we do

[Pre-Chorus]
Like ten mile road trips, baby, you're the best
You're a ten times ten times ten and I'm blessed
So let's ride 'til it's over
On this high 'til October
And we might just be sober
But with you I don't mind because

[Chorus]
Baby, you're my summer vibe
Take your picture while we're bathing in the summer light
If you want it, girl, I got it
Two's enough to party
Three o' clock is just the time to get the summer started

[Bridge]
Oh, and I know I said that we should hang out next week
But oh, since then I find it hard to get sleep
So if you don't mind that I'm asking
How 'bout tonight?
[Chorus]
Because baby, you're my summer vibe
Take your picture while we're bathing in the summer light
If you want it, girl, I got it
Two's enough to party
Three o' clock is just the time to get this funky summer party started

[Outro]
Baby, you're my summer vibe, yeah, uh
Baby, you're my summer vibe
Baby, you're my summer vibe
Baby, you're my summer vibeEmbed
