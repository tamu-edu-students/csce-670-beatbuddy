[Verse 1]
Smooth
Just like a silk-a
Soft and cuddly, hug me up like a quilt
I'm a lyrical lover
No take me for no filth
With my sexual physique
Jah know me well-built
Oh me, oh my
Well, well, can't you tell
I'm just like a turtle
Crawling out of my shell?
Gal you captivate my body
Put me under a spell
With your Khus Khus perfume
I love your sweet smell
You're the only young girl
Who can ring my bell
And I can take rejection
So you tell me "Go to Hell"

Like a arrow or a dart
Come lay down in my jacuzzi
And get some bubble bath
Only sound you will hear
Is the beating of my heart
And we will mmm-mmm
And have some sweet pillow talk
