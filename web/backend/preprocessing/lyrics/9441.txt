18 ContributorsPetals Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's the angel on
Top of the tree
Sugar, honey, here she comes
She's going to fall on me

[Verse 2]
Innocence was our fire
We told the truth
I miss the sweet boys in
The summer of their youth

[Chorus]
Tear the petals off of you
And make you tell the truth
Tear the petals off of you
Tear the petals off of you
And make you tell the truth
Tear the petals off of you

[Verse 3]
They will make you so
So cynical
The fire burns the flesh
Destroys the best that made our souls
You might also like[Verse 4]
She's the grace of this world
She's too pure
For the likes of this world
This world is a whore

[Chorus]
Tear the petals off of you
And make you tell the truth
Tear the petals off of you
Tear the petals off of you
And make you tell the truth
Tear the petals off of you

[Bridge]
Oh, it's all mine
Yeah, hey, it's all mine
I never knew what I could be
Oh, the darling buds of May
They fall with no sound
They carry you down
They carry you down
Ooh

[Verse 5]
All the lilies bloomed and blossomed
Wilted and they're shivering
I can't stop their withering
Oh, this world is a war
[Chorus]
Tear the petals off of you
And make you tell the truth
Tear the petals off of you
Tear the petals off of you
And make you tell the truth
Tear the petals off of you
Tear the petals off of you
And make you tell the truth
Tear the petals off of youEmbed
