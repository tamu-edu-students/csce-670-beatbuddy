At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

[Bridge]
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I've never known, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You smiled, you smiled
Oh, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at lastYou might also like19Embed At Last At Last! Etta James soul
