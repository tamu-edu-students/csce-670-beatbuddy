1 SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.
2 Congress makes the following findings:
3 (1) The passage of this Act recognizes that the
4 primary tenets of its success depend on securing the 8
EAS13500 S.L.C.
1 sovereignty of the United States of America and es-
2 tablishing a coherent and just system for integrating
3 those who seek to join American society.
4 (2) We have a right, and duty, to maintain and
5 secure our borders, and to keep our country safe and
6 prosperous. As a nation founded, built and sustained
7 by immigrants we also have a responsibility to har-
8 ness the power of that tradition in a balanced way
9 that secures a more prosperous future for America.
10 (3) We have always welcomed newcomers to the
11 United States and will continue to do so. But in
12 order to qualify for the honor and privilege of even-
13 tual citizenship, our laws must be followed. The
14 world depends on America to be strong — economi-
15 cally, militarily and ethically. The establishment of a
16 stable, just and efficient immigration system only
17 supports those goals. As a nation, we have the right
18 and responsibility to make our borders safe, to es-
19 tablish clear and just rules for seeking citizenship, to
20 control the flow of legal immigration, and to elimi-
21 nate illegal immigration, which in some cases has be-
22 come a threat to our national security.
23 (4) All parts of this Act are premised on the
24 right and need of the United States to achieve these 9
EAS13500 S.L.C.
1 goals, and to protect its borders and maintain its
2 sovereignty.

EAS13500 S.L.C.

6 notice shall be given to the individual

8 knowledge in the System under pen-
9 alty of perjury that it provided the
10 employee with the further action no-
11 tice. The individual shall affirmatively

17 peal a nonconfirmation.
18 ‘‘(III) NO CONTEST.—If the indi-
19 vidual refuses to acknowledge receipt
20 of the further action notice, acknowl-

5 firmation in such manner as the Sec-

24 to the employer, and including time to
25 permit the individual to obtain and 438
EAS13500 S.L.C.
1 provide needed evidence of identity or
2 employment eligibility, the Secretary
3 shall extend the period for providing
4 confirmation or nonconfirmation for
5 stated periods beyond 10 business
6 days. When confirmation or noncon-
7 firmation is provided, the confirma-
8 tion system shall provide an appro-
9 priate code indicating such confirma-
10 tion or nonconfirmation.
11 ‘‘(V) REEXAMINATION.—Nothing
12 in this section shall prevent the Sec-
13 retary from establishing procedures to
14 reexamine a case where a confirma-
15 tion or nonconfirmation has been pro-
16 vided if subsequently received infor-
17 mation indicates that the confirmation
18 or nonconfirmation may not have been
19 correct. Any procedures for reexam-
20 ination shall not limit in any way an
21 employee’s right to appeal a noncon-
22 firmation.

24 TIONS.—An employer may not termi-
25 nate employment or take any other 439
EAS13500 S.L.C.
1 adverse action against an individual
2 solely because of a failure of the indi-
3 vidual to have identity and employ-
4 ment eligibility confirmed under this
5 subsection until—
6 ‘‘(aa) a nonconfirmation has
7 been issued;

9 notice was contested, the period
10 to timely file an administrative
11 appeal has expired without an
12 appeal; or

14 appeal has been filed, the non-
15 confirmation has been upheld.

17 TION.—Not later than 3 business days
18 after an employer receives a nonconfirma-
19 tion, or during such other reasonable time

22 ject of the nonconfirmation, and provide
23 information about filing an administrative
24 appeal pursuant to paragraph (6) and re-
25 quest for a hearing before an administra-440
EAS13500 S.L.C.
1 tive law judge pursuant to paragraph (7).
2 The nonconfirmation notice shall be given
3 to the individual in writing and the em-
4 ployer shall acknowledge in the System
5 under penalty of perjury that it provided
6 the notice (or adequately attempted to pro-
7 vide notice, but was unable to do so despite
8 reasonable efforts). The individual shall af-
9 firmatively acknowledge in writing, or in
10 such other manner as the Secretary may
11 prescribe, the receipt of the nonconfirma-
12 tion notice from the employer. If the indi-
13 vidual refuses or fails to acknowledge the
14 receipt of the nonconfirmation notice, the
15 employer shall notify the Secretary in such
16 manner as the Secretary may prescribe.

24 (7)(A), the employer shall not terminate
25 the individual’s employment under this 442

21 tody, serve upon the alien the custody decision speci-
22 fying the reasons for continued custody and the
23 amount of bond if any.
24 ‘‘(3) The Attorney General shall ensure the
25 alien has the opportunity to appear before an immi-
26 gration judge for a custody determination hearing 653

6 sion, except that in no case shall the hearing occur
7 more than seven days (including weekends and holi-
8 days) after the alien was taken into custody.

19 onstrates that no conditions, including the use of al-
20 ternatives to detention that maintain custody over
21 the alien, will reasonably assure the appearance of
22 the alien as required and the safety of any other
23 person and the community. For aliens detained
24 under 236(c), the immigration judge may review the
25 custody determination if the Secretary agrees the 654
EAS13500 S.L.C.

2 natives to detention exist that assure the appearance
3 of the alien as required and the safety of any other
4 person and the community.

6 tody after a custody determination, the Attorney
7 General shall provide de novo custody determination

17 is low interview wait times for all applicants, the
18 Secretary of State shall nevertheless establish, on a
19 limited, pilot basis only, a fee-based premium proc-
20 essing service to expedite interview appointments. In

22 shall remain available for obligation until ex-
23 pended.

3 ‘‘(D) NONREFUNDABLE.—Such fee will be
4 nonrefundable to the applicant.

6 ESSING.—Premium processing pertains solely to the
7 expedited scheduling of a visa interview. Utilizing
8 the premium processing service for an expedited
9 interview appointment does not establish the appli-
10 cant’s eligibility for a visa. The Secretary of State
11 shall, if possible, inform applicants utilizing the pre-
12 mium processing of potential delays in visa issuance
13 due to additional screening requirements, including
