And which way the wind blows
When this day is done

Breathe, breathe in the air
Set your intentions
Dream with care
Tomorrow is a new day for everyone
Brand new moon, brand new sun

So follow, follow the sun
The direction of the birds
The direction of love

Breathe, breathe in the air
Cherish this moment
Cherish this breath
Tomorrow is a new day for everyone
Brand new moon, brand new sun

When you feel life coming down on you
Like a heavy weight
When you feel this crazy society
Adding to the strain
Take a stroll to the nearest waters
And remember your place
Many moons have risen and fallen long, long before you came
