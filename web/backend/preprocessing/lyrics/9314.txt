28 ContributorsHand of Blood Lyrics[Intro]
Oh!
There goes my valentine again
Soaked in red for what she said
And now she's gone!

[Verse 1]
Oh my god have I done it again?!
There's a pulse and it's deafening!
I can't help what I hear in my head!
It's the switch that I flick (When it says)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hand of blood!)
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
(Hand of blood!)
I don't want to see, my life is burning!

[Chorus]
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing? (I saw you run!)
I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?
You might also like[Verse 2]
There's a stain on my hand and it's red!
Oh my god, am I losing it?
I can't help what I've done or I've said
It's the button I push (When it says)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hand of blood!)
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
(Hand of blood!)
I don't want to see, my life is burning!

[Chorus]
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing? (I saw you run!)
I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?

[Guitar Solo]
No!

[Chorus]
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing? (I saw you run!)
I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?8Embed Hand Of Blood The Poison Bullet For My Valentine metalcore
