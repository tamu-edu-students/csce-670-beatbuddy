14 ContributorsWhen I See You Smile Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I wonder
How I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue
'Cuz sometimes it seems
Like this world is closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And, then, I see you reach for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I wanna give up
Wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And, then, I see you, baby!
And everything's alright
Everything's alright

[Chorus]
When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh!
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile
See a ray of light
Oh!
See it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby! When I see you smile
At me
Oh, yeah!

Baby! There's nothing
In this world that could ever do
What the touch of your hand can do?
It's like nothing that I ever knew, hey!

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the rain is falling
I don't feel it
'Cuz you're here with me now!
I want your answer, baby!
It's all I'll ever need
It's all I'll ever need

[Chorus]
When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh!
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light
Oh!
I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile, baby!
Baby! When I see you smile at me
[Bridge]
Sometimes I wanna give up
I wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you, baby!
And everything's alright
Hey!
Everything's alright
So right!

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh!
You know I can do anything, yeah!
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light
Oh!
I see it shining right through the rain, yeah!

[Outro]
When I see you smile, yeah!
I can face the world
Oh!
You know, I can do anything now!
When I see you smile
Oh, yeah!
Baby! When I see you smile
