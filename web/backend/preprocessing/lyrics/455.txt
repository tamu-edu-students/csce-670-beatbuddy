2 ContributorsSpace Cadet Remix (feat. Gunna and Metro Boomin) (From Not All Heroes Wear Capes) Lyrics[Intro: Gunna]
Yeah, ooh
Metro on these
Boominati wave, uh
(We've done it with robotic arm on the space shuttle
We've done it with direct launch of modules)
Prepare for lightspeed

[Chorus: Gunna]
Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet (Space cadet)
Big white mansion is my habitat (Habitat)
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag (Laser tag)
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex (Rich sex)
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant (Weed plant)
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? (Where the lean at?)
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag (Beanbag)
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack (Cool rack)

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Check came from my fans, life is fantastic (Fantastic)
I was broke as hell, sleepin' on the mattress (On the mattress)
I felt like it's Hell, wasn't nobody happy
Hot shells droppin' out the semi-automatic (Hot shells)
Ran it up, bought a condo, got a new addy (Ran it up)
Got the VVs with a Vlone jean jacket (VVs)
They can't see me, even if you had 3D glasses (3D glasses)
Bad bitch in the bikini, she from Calabasas (Calabasas)
Got a pocket full of bleu cheese and some green relish
I'm a psycho for these hundreds, got a cash fetish (Cash fetish)
I've been studyin' these hundreds, I'm a mathematic
And this love make me wanna buy my dad a Caddy
'Cause the love got me geeked up, I don't need an Addy
Dracos let these niggas know we war-ready ('Cos)
Expensive clothes on my bitches, we ain't ball-cappin'
Alien, feel like I'm livin' on my own planet

[Verse 2: Trapsick]
I don't want a rollie I just want a Patek
And your girlfriend say I'm outstanding
Rap style so unique amazing
Trapping out the bando it wasn't ever vacant
Dapping up the homies on the haters dabbin'
Straight racks you know I ain't never cappin'
All these niggas fake hating and they just actin'
Double cup drink and it's straight active
Space cadet I'm a space place addict
I'm up at the top and you just ain't at it
Flying coast to coast like it was Atlantic
Click click click it's a semi-automatic
I'm so cool, imma make your girl drool
Niggas ain't even squaring up you know its just a duel
I'm making big racks and you know they hate it
What we spending in a day is their yearly savings
[Chorus: Gunna]
Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet (Space cadet)
Big white mansion is my habitat (Habitat)
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag (Laser tag)
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex (Rich sex)
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant (Weed plant)
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? (Where the lean at?)
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag (Beanbag)
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack (Cool rack)
Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet (Space cadet)
Big white mansion in my habitat (Habitat)
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag (Laser tag)
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex (Rich sex)
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant (Weed plant)
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? (Where the lean at?)
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag (Beanbag)
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack (Cool rack)
