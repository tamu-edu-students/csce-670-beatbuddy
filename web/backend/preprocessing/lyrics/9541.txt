13 ContributorsPlants Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't take me down where there's no way out, no way in
The plants can't breathe down here
Everyday there's another thing on my mind
It weights me down to the ground

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me something sweet
And I won't stay away
Bake me, bake me up a treat
And I can't stay away

[Verse 2]
I don't have class, got a lot of time on my hands
To sit, wait around for a sign
Lay in the grass, open up a can of a new
Flavor that I've never tried

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me something sweet
When the day seems so long
Bake me, bake me up a treat
I won't tell anyoneSee Crumb LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also like3Embed
