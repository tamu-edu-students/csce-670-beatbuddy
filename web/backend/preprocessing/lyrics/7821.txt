Open up
Feel the waves cut through me
Hypnotized
By the sounds I'm breathing in

[Refrain]
Hold tight, hold tight
Chemicals collide
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight

[Pre-Chorus]
Dripping lights, paint the skies
All because of you
Dripping lights, paint the skies
Only you

[Chorus]
Can make me move
You (You), you (You) can make me move
Can make me move
You (You), you (You) can make me move

[Post-Chorus]
Can make me
(You)
You (You), you (You) can make me move
Can make me

Make it last forever
Stopping time
Yeah, I'm surrendering

[Refrain]
Hold tight, hold tight
Chemicals collide
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight

[Pre-Chorus]
Dripping lights, paint the skies (Paint the skies)
All because of you (Of you, of you)
Dripping lights (Lights), paint the skies (Skies)
Only you

[Chorus]
Can make me move
You (You), you (You) can make me move
Can make me move (Can make me move, yeah)
You (You), you (You) can make me move
