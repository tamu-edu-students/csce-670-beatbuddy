2 ContributorsCHASER LyricsHiragana

Following your trail
I want to make it right
I feel bad for making you sad
I made a mistake

このゆびすりぬけ
はしりだすせおむけ
たちつくすひとり

Look at the sky no I'm not crying

Oh oh oh きみがかけめぐってる in my heart
Woah oh oh Woah oh oh
こかいがせなかおす I chase you

Baby I need your love
Oh oh おそすぎたことば
Baby Gimme your love
I know もいちどだけ

English Translation

Following your trail
I want to make it right
I feel bad for making you sad
I made a mistake
I miss you

Your finger slips away
You run with your back turned
Alone, I stand still
I couldn't say baby wait

If I hugged you stronger
Would it change this future?
It's started raining streaming down my cheeks
Look at the sky no I'm not crying

Oh oh oh you're running around in my heart
Woah oh oh Woah oh oh
Regrets weighing on my back, I chase you

Baby I need your love
Oh oh too many belated words
Baby Gimme your love
I know just one more chance

Running through puddles in the rain
Clutching onto the memories of us

If you noticed the loneliness
Would you also come out here in the rain?
It's started raining streaming down my cheeks
Look at the sky I'm just crying

Woah oh oh Woah oh oh
Struck by a rain of regret I chase you

Baby I need your love
Oh oh I'll keep on shouting
Baby Gimme your love
Right now I'll always be next to you

Tearing up without knowing the reason why
It's too late
Smile for me once more
Baby I chase you

I'm right I don't wanna hear your excuses
Blocking my ears with my reason
You didn't notice
Even though I kept sending an SOS
If I was you baby, I'd be torn up
This time, the connection of our points
Seems like it's about to break, my love

Baby I need your love
Oh oh too many belated words
Baby Gimme your love
I know just one more chance

Baby
(Hey please forgive me babe)
I need your love
(I won't do it again)
Oh oh
(Uh oh)
I'll keep on shouting

Baby
(I feel bad for making you sad)
Gimme your love
(I made a mistake)
Right now
(Right now)
I'll always be next to youEmbed
