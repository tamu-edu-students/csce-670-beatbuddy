For you, I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five-story fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wished I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

[Verse 2]
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

[Verse 3]
Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing gameYou might also like25Embed
