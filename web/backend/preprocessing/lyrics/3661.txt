28 ContributorsRx (Medicate) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wake up to a cloudy day
Dark rolls in and it starts to rain
Starin' out to the cage-like walls
Time goes by and the shadows crawl
Crushin' candy, crushin' pills
Got no job, mom pays my bills
Textin' exes, get my fill
Sweatin' bullets, Netflix chills
World's out there singin' the blues
Twenty more dead on the evening news
Think to myself, "Really, what's the use?"
I'm just like you, I was born to lose

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
When all I want's to get high
And forget this so-called life

[Chorus]
I am so frickin' bored
Nothin' to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothin' to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)

Can't wait to feel better than I ever will
Attack that shit like a kid on Benadryl
Chase it down with a hopeful smile
Hate myself, I can go for miles
They say family's all you need
Someone to trust can't help you breathe
Inhale that drug but you start to choke
You fall on the outs of an inside joke

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
'Cause I've seen enough of it, heard enough of it, felt enough of it
Had enough of it!

[Chorus]
I am so frickin' bored
Nothin' to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothin' to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)
[Bridge]
Superman is a hero
But only when his mind is clear, though
He needs that fix like the rest of us
So he's got no fear when he saves that bus
All the stars in the Hollywood Hills
Snapchat live while they pop them pills
All those flavors of the rainbow
Too bad that shit don't work though

[Post-Bridge]
Your friends are high right now
Your parents are high right now
That hot chick's high right now
That cop is high right now
The president's high right now
Your priest is high right now
Everyone's high as fuck right now
And no one's ever coming down!

[Chorus]
I am so frickin' bored
Nothin' to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothin' to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)
