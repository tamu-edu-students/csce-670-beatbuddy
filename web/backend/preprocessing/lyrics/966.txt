I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

[Breakdown: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored61Embed
