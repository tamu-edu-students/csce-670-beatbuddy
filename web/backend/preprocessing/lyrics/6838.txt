6 ContributorsThe Motto (Tiësto’s VIP Mix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
That's the motto
Throw it back with no chaser, with no trouble
Poppin' that Moët, baby, let's make some bubbles
Puffin' on that Gelato, wanna be seeing double
Gotta do what you gotta

[Pre-Chorus]
Believe it, we ain't got no plans to leave here
Tell all of your friends to be here
We ain't gonna sleep all weekend
Oh, you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
That's the motto (Mhm)
Drop a few bills and pop a few champagne bottles (Mhm)
Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto (Mhm)
We been up all damn summer
Makin' that bread and butter
Tell me, did I just stutter?
That's the motto (Mhm)
Drop a few bills and pop a fеw champagne bottles (Mhm)
Throwin' that money likе you just won the lotto (Mhm)
We been up all damn summer
Makin' that bread and butter
Tell me, did I just stutter?
That's the motto
That's the motto

[Verse 2]
Hopped in the Range, can't feel my face
The window's down
Back to my place
My birthday cake is comin' out
The way it's hittin' like, I could go all night
Don't want no bloodshot eyes
So hold my drink, let's fly

[Pre-Chorus]
Believe it, we ain't got no plans to leave here
Tell all of your friends to be here
We ain't gonna sleep all weekend
Oh, you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
That's the motto (Mhm)
Drop a few bills and pop a few champagne bottles (Mhm)
Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto (Mhm)
