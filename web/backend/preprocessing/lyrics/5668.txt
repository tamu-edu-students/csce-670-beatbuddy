We are spirit bound to this flesh
We go 'round, one foot nailed down
But bound to reach out and beyond this flesh
Become Pneuma

[Chorus]
We are will and wonder, bound to recall, remember
We are born of one breath, one word
We are all one spark, sun becoming

[Verse 2]
Child, wake up
Child, release the light
Wake up now, child
Wake up
Child, release the light
Wake up now, child

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Bound to this flesh
This guise, this mask, this dream

We are born of one breath, one word
We are all one spark, sun becoming

[Outro]
Pneuma
Reach out and beyond
Wake up, remember
We are born of one breath, one word
We are all one spark, eyes full of wonder27Embed
