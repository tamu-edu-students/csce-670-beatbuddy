38 ContributorsSour Times Lyrics[Verse 1]
To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

[Verse 2]
Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

[Bridge]
Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left
Is my memories of yesterday
Oh, these sour times
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

[Verse 3]
After time, the bitter taste
Of innocence, descent, or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide

[Chorus]
‘Cause nobody loves me, it’s true
Not like you do

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you
Nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do12Embed Sour Times Dummy Portishead trip-hop
