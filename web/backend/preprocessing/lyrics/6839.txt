1 ContributorHeart of Glass (Oliver $ & Thee Mike B Remix) [Mixed] Lyrics[Verse 1: Blondie]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

[Verse 2: Blondie]
Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

[Chorus 1: Blondie]
In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 1: Blondie]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
