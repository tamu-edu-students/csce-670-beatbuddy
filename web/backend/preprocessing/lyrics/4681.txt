23 ContributorsAbsolute Zero Lyrics[Verse 1]
The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot; I can show you the truth
And I don't need a reason to lie to you
No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it
Ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
If you don't have a weapon, you can't have mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life... it feels like a prison

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

[Verse 2]
The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your prima donnas are a privilege
My god has a need to react; it's as simple as that
It's better just to settle than face the facts
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life... it feels like a prison

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

[Bridge]
One thing that I can't stand
Is when the minutes fight the second hand
I'll waste a lifetime's worth
Just to cling to one more day

[Verse 3]
No fucking quarter, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
Man is a four-letter word, it's really absurd
The hate isn't fake; it's just inferred

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
I'm down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
Oh, I'm not afraid
And I will let you down as I hold you in
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero5Embed Absolute Zero House of Gold & Bones, Part 1 Stone Sour grunge
