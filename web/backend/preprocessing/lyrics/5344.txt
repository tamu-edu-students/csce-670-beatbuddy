1 ContributorTrippin’ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wrote this on a bus you can say that its my travel flow
Movies while we moving you can say that its a travel show
Shopping out in Brooklyn and some places that you'll never go
Online we watching TV cuz at home we ain't got cable so
Spend our money differently, focused on these accessories
A pin that's for my hat little bracelets a necessity
Cooking up the recipe, I'm trynna find my own style
Something like if Goldsmith met James Dean met Charles Brown
Classy and a bad ass little dirty playing grab ass
With my girl we out in public, but we'll save it till we get back
Telling me to stop, I was born for this quit fronting
Me and Kanye share a birthday you can't tell me that means nothing
Stuck using that Garageband, I know that that's a downgrade
Trynna make this music shit so hopefully I'll get paid
Hopefully I'll get laid, wait that already happened
Man that fuckin' happened way before I started rappin'
Man I'm so stylish I ain't even got a stylist
I take a look around and I see who looks the flyset
Then I take another look and I decide who's looking classy
Then I bring it all together now tell me what you call that shit

[Hook]
This is me home you know I'm all about it
Prolly waking in the morning putting on a fresh outfit
Skating round town levis and a button up
Snapback or strapback, you see me homies yo whats up
This is real life my girlfriend she can verify
Joints I can handle but the blunts they get me very high
Out in new york and we only stay a couple nights
Cheap fare on the bus its so rare that we would ever fly
You might also like[Verse 2]
They say that you should dress for any job that you desire
I just want to be respected also look a little flyer
Maybe look a little higher so my glasses hide my red eyes
Speeding bob and weaving catching greens even with the red lights
I work hard I've been working everyday
Since I turn sixteen you can check my resume
Its been job after job after job after job
And this music shits the same, never taking days off
My futures so odd but I'm no wolf gang member
Its the hype crew bitch, me and Steve D remember
At the bar with my girl shes only eighteen
Yea its no big deal they ain't checking I.D.s
SBs on my feet online shop for Sperrys
The sun shines bright brand new pair of Ashburys
Shout outs feed my ego got me feeling like the hottest shit
And yea I graduated but most of my friends are college kids
From CT to VT, telling you you'll see me
Hopefully on the TV I'm so humble when you meet me
I was thinking about quitting instead I made some new shit
Want to get to know me you should listen to my music
