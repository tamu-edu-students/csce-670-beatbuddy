Our first kiss was Christmas in the Walmart toy department
She said, "I should take you with me when I leave"
We were searchin' New York for a fancy, new apartment
She said, "Central Park is Sea World for trees"

[Chorus]
You ask about the cows, wearin' my sweater
It's somethin' about the weather that makes them lie down
The only time I feel I might get better is when we are together

[Verse 2]
I like socks with sandals, she's morе into scented candles
Oh, I'll nеver get that smell out of my bag
It was poorly handled
The day we both got canceled
Because I'm a racist and you're some kind of slag

[Chorus]
You ask about the cows, wearin' my sweater
It's somethin' about the weather that makes them lie down
The only time I feel I might get better is when we are together
(Oh, together)

[Bridge]
"I'm better at writin'" was just a way to get you bitin'
Oh, the truth is that our egos are absurd
I thought we were fightin'
But it seems I was gaslightin' you
I didn't know that it had its own word
You might also like[Chorus]
You still ask about the cows, wearin' my sweater
It's something about the weather that makes them lie down
The only time I feel I might get better is when we are together4Embed
