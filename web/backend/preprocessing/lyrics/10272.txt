8 ContributorsJudgement Day Lyrics[Verse 1: Eric Vanlerberghe]
I walked into the darkness
I set myself on fire
I stared into the heartless
And I found out death is a liar
So burn it all to ashes
Drown them all in acid
Say fuck pleasing the masses, don't blink
I'm going beyond your understanding
Beyond the unimagined
Be honest, are you ready or not?

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Let's find out right now
Oh, destroy yourself, welcome to the end

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe, Both]
I don't care about what they say
Everybody's sorry on judgment day
Nothing's gonna break me
I've got ice inside my veins (My vеins)
There's gotta be (Bе) a (A) better way
There's greatness in my DNA
When it all goes up in flames
You'll get yours on judgment day

I was born on the path to nowhere
Cast out, not a goddamn thing to prove
No home, no thoughts and no prayers
I've got nothing to lose, so fucking
Burn it all to ashes
Drown them all in acid
I'm done pleasing the masses, you'll see
I'm going beyond your understanding
Beyond the unimagined
Be honest, are you ready or not?

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe, Both]
'Cause I don't care (Care) about what they say
Everybody's sorry on judgment day (Judgment day)
Nothing's gonna break me
I've got ice inside my veins
There's gotta be (Be) a (A) better way
There's greatness in my DNA
When it all goes up in flames
You'll get yours on judgment day
(You'll get yours on judgment day)

[Bridge: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Do you listen to your heartbeat ticking like a clock?
We're living in a cold world, maybe you forgot
Armageddon's hard-wired, like it or not
You know the end is coming soon
If I'm fucked, so are you
[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Let's find out right now
Welcome to the end

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe, Both]
I don't care about what they say
Everybody's sorry on judgment day
Nothing's gonna break me
I've got ice inside my veins (My veins)
There's gotta be (Be) a (A) better way
There's greatness in my DNA
When it all goes up in flames
You'll get yours on judgment day1Embed
