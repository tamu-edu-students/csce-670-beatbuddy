Can we go where no one else goes?
Can I know what no one else knows?
Can we fall in love in the moonlight?

[Verse 1]
I wanna get lost with you
I wanna be lost in you (You)
Been waitin' a while for you
I need to do this right with you (You)
(I mean, If you want to)

[Chorus]
Can we go where no one else goes?
Can I know what no one else knows?
Can we fall in love in the moonlight?
Poetry and handpicked flowers
Say you’ll meet me at the altar
Can we fall in love in the moonlight?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, moonlight, I'll be smitten with you on these blue nights
You'll be holdin’ me until the sunrise
And the songbirds be wakin' up
Oh, true love, kinda hoped it would feel like a rom-com
I've been plannin' this out in my notebook
Since I was a little boy
You might also like[Verse 2]
I wanna feel safe with you
But never be tame with you (You)
And dwell in this dream with you
Let the pain disappear with you
(You, nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-da-nah-nah)

[Bridge]
Bottle of Barolo in the palm of my hand
Maybe we could sip this liquor, pretend like we in France
For the night-time, it's the right time
And 'happy ever after' always seemed like a stretch
I said, "Fuck those fairy tales" and now I want nothin' less
From you, alright? Is that alright? (Baby love)

[Chorus]
Can we go where no one else goes?
(No one else goes)
Can I know what no one else knows?
(No one else knows)
Can we fall in love in the moonlight?
Poetry and handpicked flowers
Say you’ll meet me at the altar
Can we fall in love in the moonlight? (Can we fall?)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, moonlight, I’ll be smitten with you on these blue nights
You'll be holdin’ me until the sunrise
And the songbirds be wakin' up
Oh, true love, kinda hoped it would feel like a rom-com
I've been plannin' this out in my notebook
Since I was a little boy3Embed
