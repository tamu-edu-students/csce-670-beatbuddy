2 ContributorsBreaking Me (HUGEL Remix) Lyrics[Verse]
Call me what you wanna, I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times, eh-eh
Fallin' for another, I don't even bother
I could do it all my life

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me if you wanna 'cause I got this feelin'
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you, it's like I've started dreamin'
Guess heaven's not that far away

[Chorus]
And I'll be singin'
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breakin' me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breakin' me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breakin' me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'll be singin'
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're brеakin' me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breakin' mе
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breakin' me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
(Let the fuckin' beat drop)

I'll be singin'
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breakin' me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breakin' me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breakin' me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'm just right here dancin' around to the rhythm
The rhythm that you play when you're breakin' my heart
You know that I can't get you out of my system
Yeah, right from the start, you played with my heart
And I'll be singin'
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

You're breakin' me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breakin' me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
