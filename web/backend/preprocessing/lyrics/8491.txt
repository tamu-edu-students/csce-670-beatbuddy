[Verse 1]
(Get low Bus!) Who be the King of the Sound? (Uh huh)
Busta Bus back to just put a lock on a town (Uh huh)
Lot of my bitches be comin' from miles around
See they be comin' cause they know how the God get down
(Turn it up!)
Now you know who holdin' the throne so gimme the crown
Niggas salutin' and tryna give me a pound
(Come on) I don't really fuck with you niggas, you niggas is clowns
Making the bitches strippin', throw they shit on the ground
(Get low Bus!) Now that's the way that it goes (Uh huh)
When we up in the spot the shit be flooded with hoes (Come on)
See we a make it hot, the chicks will come out their clothes
That's when you get it, mami already know I suppose
(Turn it up!)
Shorty wildin' and Shorty open, she beastin' it out
For the record, just a second I'm freaking it out
(Come on) While she tryna touch see I was peepin' it out
She turned around and was tryna put my dick in her mouth
I let her

[Verse 2]
(Get low Bus!) And as we started, got me ringin' her bell (Uh huh)
When I come I be doin' it and doin' it well (Uh huh)
Then I beat up the coochie and be makin' it swell
Tryna hide the smell of the sex, spraying on the Chanel
(Turn it up!)
Then they try to walk with a strut so no one could tell
(Come on) How a nigga got in they butt, made everything jail
(Come on) Now the chick will wild like a nut, she blowin' my cell
(Come on) Can't get enough of the kid, I put her under my spell
(Get low Bus!) It's crowded, mami, move it along (Uh huh)
If you know you 'bout it then get to removin' your thong (Uh huh)
To the whip and back of the truck that's where you belong
After the yac, see the type of raunchy shit they be on
(Turn it up!)
Street niggas respect it because my movement is strong
(Come on) 'Cause we consistently rep and see my money is long
All my bitches is wit' me, see how they singing the song
Plus how we give 'em the stick and we be dickin' along
I let her

[Verse 3]
(Get low Bus!) The God of the block, see that I'm back (Uh huh)
Every single time that I drop, the shit is a wrap (Uh huh)
For the niggas hatin' the kid I'm close to the strap
Cause all these bitches wanna come talk to sit on my lap
(TURN IT UP!!)
Every time I give you bang shit to knock in ya whip
(Come on) Nigga always do his thing, bitch, lockin' the strip
(Come on) Lot of mamis is dancin' and they shakin' their hips
After that they get low and put the thing on their lips
I let them
