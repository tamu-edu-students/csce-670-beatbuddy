I know that you're waiting for me like a dog
But have some patience for the part of me that's lost
There's been a hundred times
When I don't recognize
Any of you that love me
I try to memorize and identify
But it's all getting foggy

[Pre-Chorus]
My head is in the clouds right now
Just pray I come around, around

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, are you lonely?
I'm sorry, it's just the chemicals
Hello, hello, do you know me?
I'm called Mr. Forgettable

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable

[Verse 2]
The old mе hides while the nеw me fights
Look in my eyes, he's still in there, right?
Did the kitchen change?
What about your name?
You used to be my heart
And now you're just a face
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
My head is in the clouds right now
Just pray I come around, around (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, are you lonely?
I'm sorry, it's just the chemicals
Hello, hello, do you know me?
I'm called Mr. Forgettable

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable (Mr. Forgettable)

[Outro]
Hello, hello, are you lonely?
I'm sorry, it's just the chemicals
Hello, hello, do you know me?
They call me Mr. Forgettable4Embed
