Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh-ah, Mother, should I build the wall?

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh-ah, is it just a waste of time?
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mamma's gonna keep you right here, under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm

[Post-Chorus: David Gilmour]
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe
Of course, Mamma's gonna help build the wall

[Guitar Solo]

Mother, do you think she's good enough… For me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous… To me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh-ah, Mother, will she break my heart?

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mamma won't let anyone dirty get through
Mamma's gonna wait up until you get in
Mamma will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

[Post-Chorus: David Gilmour]
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe
You'll always be “baby” to me

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Mother, did it need to be so high?31Embed
