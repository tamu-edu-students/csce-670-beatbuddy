25 ContributorsParadise Circus Lyrics[Verse 1: Hope Sandoval]
It's unfortunate that when we feel a stone
We can roll ourselves over 'cause we're uncomfortable
Oh well, the devil makes us sin
But we like it when we're spinning in his grin

[Chorus: Hope Sandoval]
Love is like a sin, my love
For the ones that feel it the most
Look at her with her eyes like a flame
She will love you like a fly will never love you again

[Verse 2: Hope Sandoval]
It's unfortunate that when we feel a stone
We can roll ourselves over when we're uncomfortable
Oh well, the devil makes us sin
But we like it when we're spinning in his grin

[Chorus: Hope Sandoval]
Love is like a sin, my love
For the one that feels it the most
Look at her with her smile like a flame
She will love you like a fly will never love you againSee Massive Attack LiveGet tickets as low as $75You might also like23Embed
