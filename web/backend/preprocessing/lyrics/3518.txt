5 ContributorsAre You Happy? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another fight where no one wins again
'Cause we don't care if we're careful anymore
So you hurt me and then I hurt you back

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember how tangled we got in our feelings?
Caught up on the small things
And I know I thought that pain's a part of love
But I think I broke you, though I didn't mean to

[Chorus]
But are you happy looking back at us
When you met me?
Would you go back and tell yourself to leave it
Knowing what we know?
Or are you happy that we happened in our twenties?
So you know what you want isn't with me
Would you go back and tell yourself to leave it
Knowing how it goes?
Or are you happy that we happened? Ah

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
You taught me how to let somebody in
And how to let go of someone you love
To fall apart and then get up again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I remember how deeply we fell in our feelings
Head first without reason
And I know I thought that pain's a part of love
But I think you broke me, though you didn't mean to

[Chorus]
But are you happy looking back at us
When you met me?
Would you go back and tell yourself to leave it
Knowing what we know?
Or are you happy that we happened in our twenties?
So you know what you want isn't with me
Would you go back and tell yourself to leave it
Knowing how it goes? (How it goes)
Or are you happy that we happened? Ah

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah
Are you happy that we happened? Ah
Ah, ah, ah

[Outro]
Are you happy looking back at us
When you met me?
Would you go back and tell yourself to leave it
Knowing what we know?
Or are you happy that we happened? Ah3Embed
