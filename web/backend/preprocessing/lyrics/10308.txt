Fine!
We’re “damaged”
Really “damaged”
But that does not make us “wise”
We’re not “special”, we’re not “different”
We don’t choose who lives or dies
Let’s be normal, see bad movies
Sneak a beer and watch TV
We’ll bake brownies or go bowling
Don’t you want a life with me?
Can’t we be seventeen?
That’s all I want to do
If you could let me in
I could be good with you
People hurt us

[J.D.]
Or they vanish

[VERONICA]
And you’re right, that really blows
But we let go—

[J.D.]
Take a deep breath
You might also like[VERONICA]
Then go buy some summer clothes
We'll go camping—

[J.D.]
Play some poker

[VERONICA]
And we’ll eat some chili fries
Maybe prom night

[J.D.]
Maybe dancing
[VERONICA]
Don't stop looking in my eyes

[J.D.]
Your eyes

[BOTH]
Can't we be seventeen
Is that so hard to do?
If you could let me in
I could be good with you
Let us be seventeen
If we still got the right
[VERONICA]
So what’s it gonna be?
I wanna be with you

[J.D.]
I wanna be with you

[VERONICA]
Wanna be with you

[BOTH]
Tonight

[VERONICA]
Yeah we’re damaged

[J.D.]
Badly damaged

[BOTH]
But your love’s too good to lose

[VERONICA]
Hold me tighter

[J.D.]
Even closer
[VERONICA]
I’ll stay if I’m what you choose

[J.D.]
Can't we be seventeen?

[VERONICA]
If I am what you choose

[J.D.]
If we've still got the right

[VERONICA]
‘Cause you’re the one I choose

[J.D.]
You’re the one I choose

[BOTH]
You’re the one I choose17Embed
