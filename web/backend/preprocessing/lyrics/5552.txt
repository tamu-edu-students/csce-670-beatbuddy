I've been away a little while, sometimes I just can't help myself
When my mind's runnin' wild, I seem to lose grip on reality
And I try to disregard the crazy things the voices tell me to do
But it's no use
I tried to own it, write songs about it
Believe me, I've tried, in the end, I needed to breathe
Find inspiration, some kind of purpose
To take a second to face the shit that makes me me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

[Verse 2]
I saw the world a couple of times, tried to cure the ache with absence
But that hole was still a hole and my mind kept playin' tricks on me
Feelin' older every day, took everything I had to not crash and burn
But I'm starting to learn
Sometimes I'll fall down, sometimes I'll lose hope
But those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground
I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here
So I keep pushin' the limits of what makes me me

All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

[Post-Chorus]
(Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely)

[Bridge]
I can be better than I was
I can be better than I am
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room9Embed
