36 ContributorsBall and Biscuit Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
And right now, you could care less about me
But soon enough, you will care by the time I'm done

[Verse 2]
Let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar
And take our sweet little time about it
Let's have a ball, girl
And take our sweet little time about it
Tell everybody in the place to just get out
We'll get clean together
And I'll find me a soapbox where I can shout it

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now read it in the newspaper
Ask your girlfriends and see if they know
Read it in the newspaper
Ask your girlfriends and see if they know
That my strength is ten fold girl
I'll let you see it if you want to before you go

Let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar
And take our sweet little time about it
Let's have a ball
And take our sweet little time about it
Tell everybody in the place to just get out
We'll get clean together
And I'll find me a soapbox where I can shout it
And I can think of one or two things to say about it
Alright, listen

[Guitar Solo]
Alright, you get the point now?

[Verse 4]
It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
It was the other two which made me your third
But it's my mother who made me the seventh son
And right now, you could care less about me
But soon enough, you will care by the time I'm done

[Outro]
Yeah, you just wait
You stick around
You'll figure it out8Embed Ball and Biscuit Elephant The White Stripes garage
