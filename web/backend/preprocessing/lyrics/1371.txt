I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm havin' fun
I think I'm dumb
[Chorus 1]
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy

[Verse 2]
My heart is broke, but I have some glue
Help me inhale and mend it with you
We'll float around and hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
[Chorus 2]
And have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
[Bridge]
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothin' burn, wake me up

The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm havin' fun
I think I'm dumb
[Chorus 1]
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy

[Outro]
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb58Embed Dumb In Utero - 20th Anniversary Remaster Nirvana alt-rock
