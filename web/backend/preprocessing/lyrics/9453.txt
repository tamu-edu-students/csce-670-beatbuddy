Verse 2 (Ed Sheeran)
You are the heat on a summer day
I can feel my hearts been done away with
I feel electric each time
You push your body on mine
Step up from the crowd let’s runaway
You could make me fall in love again
I want this feeling all night
When you push your back up and
I say...!

Pre- Hook:
I nah go, I nah go, I nah go leave you never
I nah go, I nah go, I nah go diss you never

Chorus:
Baby want you to whine pon my body
Brace it, brace it pon me
Stay there and let me whine on your body
Brace it, brace it pon me
