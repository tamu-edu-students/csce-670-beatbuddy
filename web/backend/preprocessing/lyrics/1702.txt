I am not a stranger to the dark
"Hide away," they say
"'Cause we don't want your broken parts"
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
"Run away," they say
"No one'll love you as you are"

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today
I won't let the shame sink in
We are burstin' through the barricades
And reachin' for the sun (We are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become (Yeah, that's what we've become)

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
(This is me)
[Bridge]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I know that I deserve your love
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's nothin' I'm not worthy of
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out
This is brave, this is bruised
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come (Look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum (Marchin' on, marchin', marchin' on; to the beat I drum)
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Outro]
(Whenever the words wanna cut me down)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (I'll send the flood to drown them out)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm gonna send a flood
Gonna drown them out, ah
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
