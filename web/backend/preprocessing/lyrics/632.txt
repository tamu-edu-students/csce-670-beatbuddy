All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart, yeah

[Verse 1]
Shotgun, aimed at my heart, you got one
Tear me apart and then some
How do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
I tried to run away but your eyes
Tell me to stay, oh why
Why do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I say

[Chorus]
All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart (Ah)

You pick me up and play me
How do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
One time, tell me you need me tonight
To make it easy, you lie
And say it's all for love (Woah-oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I say

[Chorus]
All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
