49 ContributorsCemetery Gates Lyrics[Intro]
Reverend, reverend
Is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins
No revenge beneath me
Lost within my plans for life
It all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world
Left in my misery

[Instrumental Break 00:49-02:08]

[Verse 1]
The reverend he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why
I will remember
The love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see now is your

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I guess you took my youth and gave it all away
Like the birth of a new-found joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died, I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories now unfold
You might also like[Chorus]
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Through all those complex years I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried
And spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

[Chorus]
The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates
[Instrumental Break 04:53-05:49]
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery

[Outro]
