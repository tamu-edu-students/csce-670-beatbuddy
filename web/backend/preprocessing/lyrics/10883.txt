15 ContributorsAmaranth Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baptized with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself

War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone

[Pre-Chorus]
You believe, but what you see
You receive, but what you give

[Chorus]
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

[Verse 2]
Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time
We reach for the ones who ever dare

[Pre-Chorus]
You believe, but what you see
You receive, but what you give
You might also like[Chorus]
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

[Bridge]
Reachin', searchin' for something untouched
Hearing voices of the Never-Fading callin'
Callin'... Callin'

[Chorus]
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak (daybreak)8Embed Amaranth Dark Passion Play Nightwish opera
