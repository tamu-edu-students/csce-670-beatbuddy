Keep on runnin'
Keep on runnin'

[Verse]
Oh my god, I just feel so lost when you're gone
Sad to the bone
Day and night, I been searchin' deep in my soul
Now I know

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what it takes
I'll be waitin' there for you
I can't breathe until you're in my arms
Oh my god, I just feel so lost when you're gone
Sad to the bone

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll keep runnin'
I know you're waitin'
I know you're waitin' for me
Gotta get home
This is where I belong
I keep runnin'
I keep runnin'
