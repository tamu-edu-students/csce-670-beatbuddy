48 ContributorsYou’re Somebody Else Lyrics[Verse 1: Cole Randall]
I saw the part of you
That only when you're older, you will see too
You will see too
I held the better cards
But every stroke of luck has gotta bleed through
It's gotta bleed through
You held the balance of the time
That only blindly I could read you
But I could read you
It's like you told me
Go forward slowly
It's not a race to the end

[Chorus: Cole Randall]
Well, you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well, you talk like yourself
No, I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous

[Verse 2: Cole Randall]
You were the better part
Of every bit of beating heart that I had
Whatever I had
I finally sat alone
Pitch black flesh and bone
Couldn't believe that you were gone
You might also like[Chorus: Cole Randall]
Well, you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well, you talk like yourself
No, I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous
Well, you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface (Surface)
Well, you talk like yourself
No, I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous (Nervous)
[Bridge: Cole Randall - Distorted voice]
Where are we?
Where are we?

[Chorus: Cole Randall]
Well, you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well, you talk like yourself
No, I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous
Well, you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well, you talk like yourself
No, I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous

[Outro: Cole Randall]
I saw the part of you
That only when you're older, you will see too
You will see too27Embed
