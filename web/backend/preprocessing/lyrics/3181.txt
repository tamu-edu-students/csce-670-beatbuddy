And hey, darling
I hope you're good tonight
And I know you don't feel right when I'm leaving
Yeah, I want it, but no, I don't need it
Tell me something sweet to get me by
'Cause I can't come back home 'til they're singing

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
La, la la la, la la la, 'til everyone is singing

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear to you that we can make this last, la, la
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear, come tomorrow, this will all be in our past

[Post-Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Well, it might be for the best
[Verse 2: Sierra Kusterbeck]
And hey, sweetie
Well, I need you here tonight
And I know that you don't want to be leaving me
Yeah, you want it, but I can't help it
I just feel complete when you're by my side
But I know you can't come home 'til they're singing

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear to you that we can make this last, la, la
If you can wait 'til I get home

[Post-Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Well, it might be for the best

[Bridge: Jeremy McKinnon, Sierra Kusterbeck, Both]
You know you can't give me what I need
And even though you mean so much to me
I can't wait through everything
Is this really happening?
I swear, I'll never be happy again
And don't you dare say we can just be friends
I'm not some boy that you can sway
We knew it'd happen eventually

[Outro: Everyone, Jeremy McKinnon]
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
(If you can wait 'til I get home)
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
(Then I swear we can make this last)
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
(If you can wait 'til I get home)
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
(Then I swear we can make this last)
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing, la...43Embed If It Means A Lot To You Homesick A Day To Remember metalcore
