So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a real long time
I've been a bad boy, and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

[Verse 1]
You've got pep in your step, you live your life with no regret
How you look when you are wet is something I cannot forget
I just wanna kiss your lips, the ones between your hips
If I cashed in all my chips on you, then, baby, I'd be rich

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on
Sexy, please, text me, I'm ready for you
So come on
Waiting, I'm begging, so, please, get here soon

[Chorus]
So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a real long time
I've been a bad boy, and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

[Verse 2]
Ooh la la, what lovely curves
Baby, I get off by getting you off first
Sorry, girl, if this is quick
So, please, just take it in the ass and suck my dick
