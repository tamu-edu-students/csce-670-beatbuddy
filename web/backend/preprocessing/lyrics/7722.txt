The lonely nights
I used to touch up on your thigh
I used to hate it when you always cry
I used to hate it when we always fight
The lonely nights
I wake up, say my grace, and close my eyes
I miss when you were right here, by my side
I miss the glare that you had in your eyes
The lonely nights
I'm getting weaker as the day goes by
I look up in the sky, and ask out why?
I need to renounce to my soul, I cry

The lonely nights
I used to touch up on your thigh
I used to hate it when we always fight
I used to hate it when you always cry
The lonely nights
I wake up, say my grace, and close my eyes
I miss when you were right here, by my side
I miss the glare that you had in your eyes
The lonely nights
I'm getting weaker as the day goes by
I look up in the sky, and ask out why?
I need to renounce to my soul, I cryYou might also like5Embed
