I still remember, third of December
Me in your sweater, you said it looked better
On me than it did you, only if you knew
How much I liked you, but I watch your eyes as she

[Pre-Chorus]
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

[Chorus]
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, wish I were Heather
[Verse 2]
Watch as she stands with her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

[Pre-Chorus]
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Wish I were Heather

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, wish I were157Embed
