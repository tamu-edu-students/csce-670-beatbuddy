You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Verse 1: John Mayer]
My girl, she isn't the one
I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
Because I've fought against it hard enough to know

[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer]
That you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love
You might also like[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
My boy ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time
But you should see him when he shines
You never want to let that feeling go

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry & John Mayer]
When you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Yeah, you love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer & Katy Perry]
Oh you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Outro: Katy Perry]
It's who you love
Who you love
Who you love
Who you love
You're the one I love12Embed
