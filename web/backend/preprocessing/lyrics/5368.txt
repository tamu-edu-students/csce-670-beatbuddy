21 ContributorsLove Her Madly Lyrics[Intro]
Don't ya love her madly?
Don't ya need her badly?
Don't ya love her ways?
Tell me what you say

[Verse]
Don't you love her madly?
Wanna be her daddy?
Don't ya love her face?
Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door
Like she did one thousand times before?

[Bridge]
Don't you love her ways?
Tell me what you say
Don't ya love her as she's walking out the door?

[Chorus 1]
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love

[Chorus 2]
All your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem to be on the mark

Yeah, don't you love her?
Don't you love her as she's walking out the door?

[Chorus 1]
All your love
All your love
All your love

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, all your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem to be on the mark

Well, don't ya love her madly?
Don't you love her madly?5Embed
