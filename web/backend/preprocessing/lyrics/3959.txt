20 ContributorsMONSTERS Lyrics[Verse 1]
Good for you, you fooled everybody
Good for you, you fooled everyone
Good for you, now you're somebody
Good for you, you fooled everyone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Leave your weapon on the table
Wrapped in burlap, barely able
Don't get angry, don't discourage
Take a shot of liquid courage

[Chorus]
'Cause my monsters are real
And they're trained how to kill
And there's no coming back
And they just laugh at how I feel
And these monsters can fly
And they'll never say "die"
And there's no going back
If I get trapped, I'll never heal
Yeah, my monsters are real

[Verse 2]
Good for you, you hurt everybody
Good for you, you hurt everyone
Good for you, you love nobody
Good for you, you owe no one

Leave your weapon on the table
Wrapped in burlap, barely able
Call a doctor, say a prayer
Choose a god you think is fair

[Chorus]
'Cause my monsters are real
And they're trained how to kill
And there's no coming back
And they just laugh at how I feel
And these monsters can fly
And they'll never say "die"
And there's no going back
If I get trapped, I'll never heal
'Cause my monsters are real

[Bridge]
Leave your weapon on the table
Wrapped in burlap, barely able
Don't get angry, don't discourage
Take a shot of liquid courage
Leave a light on if you're able
'Cause we both know you're unstable
Call a doctor, say a prayer
Choose a god you think is there
[Chorus]
'Cause my monsters are real
And they're trained how to kill
And there's no coming back
And they just laugh at how I feel
And these monsters can fly
And they'll never say "die"
And there's no going back
If I get trapped, I'll never heal
Yeah, my monsters are real7Embed MONSTERS ATTENTION ATTENTION Shinedown grunge
