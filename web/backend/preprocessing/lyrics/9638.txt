I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary flies
I take pride as the king of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice

[Verse 2]
If you ever need anything, please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy actin' like I'm not naïve
I've seen it all, I was here first

[Chorus]
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt

[Verse 2]
If you ever need anything, please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy actin' like I'm not naïve
I've seen it all, I was here first

[Chorus]
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the ground
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirtYou might also like26Embed Very Ape In Utero - 20th Anniversary Remaster Nirvana grunge
