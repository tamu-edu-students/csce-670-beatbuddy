Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Somethin' happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time, I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide and
I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes (Echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo hidin' my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now, I'm your daisy

And, baby, for you, I (I) would (Would) fall from grace
Just (Just) to (To) touch your face, if (If) you (You) walk away
I'd beg ya on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (Yeah, ooh)
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
I get so high, oh
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
