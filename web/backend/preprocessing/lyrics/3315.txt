Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh, I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah, others, they got none, uh-huh

[Refrain]
Stay with me, oh, let's just breathe

[Verse 2]
Practiced all my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh
Under everythin', just another human bein', uh-huh
Yeah, I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed

[Refrain]
Stay with me, you're all I see

[Chorus]
Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool, you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean

[Verse 3]
I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everythin' you gave and nothin' you would take, uh-huh

Nothin' you would take, everythin' you gave

[Chorus]
Did I say that I need you?
Oh, did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool, you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean, ah

[Outro]
Nothin' you would take, everythin' you gave
Oh, hold me 'til I die, meet you on the other side27Embed Just Breathe Backspacer Pearl Jam grunge
