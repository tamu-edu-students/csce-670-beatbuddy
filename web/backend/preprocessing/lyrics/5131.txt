2 ContributorsMaking All Things New Lyrics[Verse 1]
I leave all the windows open
Let the light come through
Sunshine warm and golden
Morning making all things new

[Chorus]
Home, where my heart is
Home, where my love lives
Home, my beginning and end
Home

[Verse 2]
Look at all the colors
Wild, wonderful and true
Your breath light as a feather
Like little whispers in the room

[Chorus]
Home, where my heart is
Home, where my love lives
Home, my beginning and end
Home
Home, where my heart is
Home, where my love lives
Home, my beginning and end
Home
Home, my beginning and end
