16 ContributorsCarry You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Torn down, full of aching
Somehow our youth would take the blame
Worn out, the way we let it stay

[Verse 2]
Taught how to celebrate it
All out, I'd replicate your pain
Climb down, if only for a taste

[Verse 3]
Hallowed, but hesitated
Shallow, but full in all your veins
Shadowed by every other weight

[Verse 4]
Hollow, a doubt can make it
Borrowed a love that never came
Followed in every other shade

[Chorus]
Let it lead your love away
I never strayed
Let it bury you away
In all your blame, in all your pain
I will carry you always
[Chorus]
Let it lead your love away
I never strayed
Let it bury you away

[Outro]
Fade me away, I won't ever be the same
Fade me away, I won't ever be the same
Fade me away, I won't ever be the sameSee Novo Amor LiveGet tickets as low as $43You might also like15Embed
