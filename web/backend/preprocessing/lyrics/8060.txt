Scum Gang!

[Chorus]
Niggas runnin' out they mouth, but they never pop out
I got the drop on your spot, everybody watch out
All my niggas on 50, so you know we hopped out
Mobbed out, opps out, we gon' show what we about
All my niggas really gang bang, talk that damn slang
Rap about it, do the same thing, let your nuts hang
We gon' pull up, nigga, ¡ándale!, on Sangre
We post up, we don't do the race, you gon' die today

[Verse]
In the spot, blow 50 bands, shit, 100 bands
Shit, my pockets on a runnin' man, fuck a rubberband
I'ma fuck her in a handstand, she a fan, man
Need the drugs? I'm the Xan man, I'm the damn man
I roll up, I'm gon' be booted, stupid, and shootin' stupid
Brought a knife, I brought a Ruger, stupid, I really do this
If I tote it then you know I'll shoot it and I'ma prove it
Back, back, don't be movin', stupid, or I'ma use it (Squad)
Dicky stiffy, uh, bet she give some licky, uh
Lil bitty, uh, bust all on her titties, uh
She a skeezer, uh, really don't need her, uh
Bust then I leave her, uh, she a little eater, uh
Get back, kickback, blow your shit back, uh
Rip that, take that, flip that, send that, uh
.223 hit, where your clothes at? Uh
Scum Gang 'bout that Fendi, fin-act, uh

You can talk hot on the internet, boy

Black van, pull up to your momma crib, boy
Tie her up, drive that shit off a bridge, lil boy
