I built a house for a love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

[Pre-Chorus]
But, oh, my
Oh, my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

[Chorus]
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried

[Verse 2]
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Tryna learn to lean into it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right

But, oh, my
Oh, my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

[Chorus]
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known

[Bridge]
Let it be known that I cried for you
Even started lying to you
What a thing to do
All because I wanted

[Chorus]
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known, known, known
That I will choose, I will lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known
Let it be known that I tried, that I tried
Let it be known that I tried23Embed
