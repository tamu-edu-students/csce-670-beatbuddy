Drank too much, got the sickness
Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
Same crew but another mistress
Every day, every night getting wasted
But I miss you, what did I do?
Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you
If I pull through, is it too soon?
Turn it up, close my eyes and I'm with you

[Verse 1]
Yo, Marvin, stop calling
Sad Iverson is ballin'
In the corner of a room by himself
You are nothin' but an empty shell
Every night, he goin' down to hell
Fake love in a shit hotel
Can't believe how far he fell
You weak on the floor, so you call her cell
"How you been? How you doing?
You been good? I been drinking
Way too much, you'd think that I'd be over you
Over you, over you"
(Eight calls, all you)
But I think about it every day, yeah
Yeah, I never missed her anyways
Yeah, I never missed her anyways (Yeah-eah-eah)

Drank too much, got the sickness
Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
Same crew but another mistress
Every day, every night getting wasted
But I miss you, what did I do?
Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you
If I pull through, is it too soon?
Turn it up, close my eyes and I'm with you

[Bridge]
Call me up
Stay over and we'll call it love
Don't matter if it fucks me up
The alcohol is not enough (Ooh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Fuck pride and the other guy
I cried, I don't 'member why
Tonight, I'ma try to hide
No slide, get frostbite
Eight calls, all you, 8 ball, all you
Yeah, I never missed her anyways
Yeah, I never missed her anyways

[Chorus]
Drank too much, got the sickness
Pray to God and his son for forgiveness (Yeah-eah-eah-eah-yeah)
Same crew but another mistress
Every day, every night getting wasted (Ooh-ohh, ooh)
But I miss you, what did I do?
Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you (Yeah-eah)
If I pull through, is it too soon?
Turn it up, close my eyes and I'm with you (Yeah-eah-eah)
Drank too much, got the sickness
Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
Same crew but another mistress
Every day, every night getting wasted (Yeah, yeah, yeah, too)
But I miss you, what did I do?
Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you (Hea-hea-hea)
If I pull through, is it too soon?
Turn it up, close my eyes and I'm with you13Embed
