I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

[Verse 1]
I know you, Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous, Forrest
Forrest Gump

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump
You might also like[Verse 2]
I saw your game, Forrest
I was screaming, "Run forty-four!"
But you kept running past the end zone
Oh, where'd you go, Forrest?
Forrest Gump

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

[Outro]
Forrest green, Forrest blues
I'm remembering you
If this is love, I know it's true
I won't forget you
(You, you, oh, you, you)
It's for you, Forrest
(You, you, oh, you, you)
It's for you, Forrest
