Heartbeat
Is coming in so strong
Oh, if you don't stop
I'm gonna need a second one
Oh, there's something I've
Been meaning to
Say to you, baby (Hold that thought)
Yeah, there's somethin' I've
Been meanin' to
Say to you, baby
But I just can't do it

[Pre-Chorus]
What a call, movin' in
I feel like I can loosen my lips (Come on so strong)
I can summarise it for you
It's simple and it goes like this

[Chorus]
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I

I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I
