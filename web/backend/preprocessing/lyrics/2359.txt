36 ContributorsTimes Like These Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away and follows you back home
I, I'm a streetlight shinin'
I'm a white light blindin' bright, burnin' off and on
Uh-uh

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again

[Verse 2]
I, I'm a new day risin'
I'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
But I, I'm a little divided
Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind?
Uh-uh

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again

Uh-uh

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again!
It's times like these you give and give again!
It's times like these you learn to love again!
It's times like these, time and time again!

[Outro]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
