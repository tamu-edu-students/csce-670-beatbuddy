I wanna love you
And treat you right
I wanna love you
Every day and every night
We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provide the bread

[Chorus]
Is this love? Is this love? Is this love?
Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this love? Is this love? Is this love?
Is this love that I'm feeling?
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know now
I got to know, got to know, got to know now
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I, I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table

I wanna love you, I wanna love and treat
Love and treat you right
I wanna love you
Every day and every night
We'll be together, yeah
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter, yeah, oh-yeah
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
