Can't you see I'm tryin'? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm stayin' there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired
[Chorus]
Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

[Verse 2]
Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted
When they lied, I knew it was just stable
Children tryin' hard not to realize
I was sitting right behind you

[Bridge]
Dear, can't you see? It's them, it's not me
We're not enemies, we just disagree
If I was like him, all pissed in this bar
He changes his mind, says I went too far
We all disagree, I think we should disagree, yeah

[Chorus]
Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm stayin' there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired37Embed
