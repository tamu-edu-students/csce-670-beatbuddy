Don't start that talking
I could talk all night
My mind goes sleepwalking
While I'm putting the world to right
Call careers information
Have you got yourself an occupation?

[Chorus]
Oliver's army is here to stay
Oliver's army are on their way
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today

[Verse 2]
There was a Checkpoint Charlie
He didn't crack a smile
But it's no laughing party
When you've been on the murder mile
Only takes one itchy trigger
One more widow, one less white nigga

[Chorus]
Oliver's army is here to stay
Oliver's army are on their way
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today

Hong Kong is up for grabs (Is up for grabs)
London is full of Arabs (Is full of Arabs)
We could be in Palestine
Overrun by the Chinese line
With the boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne

[Verse 3]
But there's no danger
It's a professional career
Though it could be arranged
With just a word in Mister Churchill's ear
If you're out of luck or out of work
We could send you to Johannesburg

[Chorus]
Oliver's army is here to stay
Oliver's army are on their way
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today
