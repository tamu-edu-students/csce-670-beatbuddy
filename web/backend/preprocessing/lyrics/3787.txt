*Laughing*

[Verse 1]
When the summer dies, severing the ties
I'm with you always, always
Will you walk the line? My path serpentine
Remember always that love is all you need

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me who you wanna be and I will set you free

[Chorus]
There's a darkness at the heart of my love
That runs cold, runs deep
The darkness at the heart of my love
For you

[Verse 2]
Will you spill the wine? To summon the divine
I'm with you always, always
Now paint a pair of eyes and let's watch as it dries
Remember always that love is all you need

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me who you wanna be and I will set you free
You might also like[Chorus]
There's a darkness at the heart of my love
That runs cold, runs deep
The darkness at the heart of my love
So bold, so sweet
There's a darkness at the heart of my love
That runs cold, runs deep
The darkness at the heart of my love
For you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
(Come to me, pleasure me, filling me, obsessively)
(Aggressively, respectively, pleasure me, pleasure me)
(Aggressively, patiently, oh)
Remember always that love is all you need
Tell me who you wanna be and I will set you free

[Chorus]
There's a darkness at the heart of my love
That runs cold, runs deep
The darkness at the heart of my love
So bold, so sweet
There's a darkness at the heart of my love (My love)
That runs cold (Runs cold), runs deep (Runs deep)
The darkness at the heart of my love (My love)
So bold (So bold), so sweet (So sweet)
And all this time you knew
That I would put you through
The darkness at the heart of my love
For you
[Outro]
When the summer dies, severing the ties
I'm with you always, always
Paint a pair of eyes, let's watch as it dries
I'm with you always, alwaysEmbed
