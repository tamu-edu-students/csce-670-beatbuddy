Hello, hello, can you hear me as I scream your name?
Hello, hello, do you need me before I fade away?

[Chorus]
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie (We live, we love, we lie)

[Verse 2]
Hello, hello, nice to meet you, voice inside my head
Hello, hello, I believe you, how can I forget?

[Chorus]
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark, I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie (We live, we love, we lie)
We live, we love, we lieSee Alan Walker LiveGet tickets as low as $12You might also like32Embed The Spectre The Spectre Alan Walker house
