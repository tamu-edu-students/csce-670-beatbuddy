48 ContributorsFaithfully Lyrics[Verse 1]
Highway run into the midnight sun
Wheels go 'round and 'round, you're on my mind
Restless hearts, sleep alone tonight
Sendin' all my love along the wire

[Pre-Chorus]
They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line, it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl, you stand by me

[Chorus]
I'm forever yours
Faithfully

[Verse 2]
Circus life under the big-top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time, always another show
Wonderin' where I am lost without you

[Pre-Chorus]
And bein' apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh, girl, you stand by me

I'm forever yours
Faithfully

[Outro]
Whoa-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Faithfully
I'm still yours
I'm forever yours
'Ever yours
