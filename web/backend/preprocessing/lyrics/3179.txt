Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one
Sometimes I sleep all day because I hate the sunlight
My hands are always shaking, body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed
Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me

[Pre-Chorus]
And whiskey seems to be my holy water
Mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters

[Chorus]
I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sake's, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today
Self-induced comatose, chemical daze
My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough
I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict
Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath

I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sake's, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
God bless all of you now
'Cause I'm going straight to Hell
And I'm taking you down with me
'Cause you know damn well

[Chorus]
I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sake's, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope, all hope20Embed
