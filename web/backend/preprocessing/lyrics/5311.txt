1 ContributorShe Doesn’t Mind Lyrics[Intro]
Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind
No, she doesn't mind
No, she doesn't mind
Girl, I got you so

[Verse 1]
Pull you close to me be my remedy
Gotta admit that I crave a simple thing
Charm me, come on, just give me
A chance to make you fall for me
You're just playing hard to get
You know that I'll fall for it
But I know you down for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands up high, we burning up the sky
We got the dance hall crazy, we got the club on fire
I like the way you dance, you got me in a trance
My baby, she don't mind at all

[Chorus]
Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind
No, she doesn't mind
No, she doesn't mind

Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like (Oh-oh)
So come and push it on me (Oh-oh) if it feels alright (Oh-oh)
When you drop it low, and break me off (Oh-oh)
No, she doesn't mind (Oh-oh)
No, she doesn't mind (Oh-oh)
No, she doesn't mind (Oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Tell me you're mine, yeah, girl
All of the stars, they align, yeah girl
Want you beside all the time, don't waste any time
Put my pride on the side, yeah girl
You just playing hard to get
You know that I'll fall for it
But are you down for this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands up high, we burning up the sky
We got the dance hall crazy, we got the club on fire
I like the way you dance, you got me in a trance
My baby, she don't mind at all

[Chorus]
Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind
No, she doesn't mind
No, she doesn't mind
[Post-Chorus]
Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like (Oh-oh)
So come and push it on me (Oh-oh) if it feels alright (Oh-oh)
When you drop it low, and break me off (Oh-oh)
No, she doesn't mind (Oh-oh)
No, she doesn't mind (Oh-oh)
No, she doesn't mind (Oh-oh)Embed
