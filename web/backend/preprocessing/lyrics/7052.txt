25 ContributorsAll Shook Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Uh, well, a-bless my soul, what's wrong with me?
I'm itchin' like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Mm, ooh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Mm, ooh, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I feel fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death

[Verse 3]
When she touched my hand, what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Mm, ooh, yeah, yeah

My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine

[Verse 4]
She touched my hand, what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Mm, ooh, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Mm, ooh, yeah, yeah
I'm all shook up7Embed All Shook Up Elvis' Golden Records Elvis Presley rock-n-roll
