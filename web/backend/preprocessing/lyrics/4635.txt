32 ContributorsLaid to Rest Lyrics[Intro]
If there was a single day I could live...
A single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away

[Verse 1]
The blood's on the wall
So you'd might as well just admit it
And bleach out the stains
Commit to forgetting it
You're better off empty and blank
Than left with a single, pathetic trace of this

[Pre-Chorus]
Smother another failure
Lay this to rest

[Chorus]
Console yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck
Absorb yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself

[Verse 2]
I'll chain you to the truth
For the truth shall set you free
I'll turn the screws of vengeance
And bury you with honesty
I'll make all your dreams come to life
Then slay them as quickly as they came

Smother another failure
Lay this to rest

[Chorus]
Console yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck
Absorb yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself

[Bridge]
See who gives a fuck
See who gives a fuck
See who gives a fuck
Failure

[Outro]
If there was a day I could live
If there was a single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away
I'd trade all the others away8Embed Laid to Rest Ashes of the Wake (15th Anniversary) Lamb of God metalcore
