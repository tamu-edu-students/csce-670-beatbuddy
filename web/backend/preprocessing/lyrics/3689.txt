59 ContributorsWhy We Thugs Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, come on

[Hook]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 1]
I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a goddamn thang changed
It’s the same old same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day-to-day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower-livin'?
The projects, thank God for Russell Simmons
Thank God for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggas taken over showbiz
See Ice Cube LiveGet tickets as low as $61You might also like[Hook]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 2]
It's boys in the hood, it's toys in the hood
Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood
‘Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a Crip and a Blood in the hood
‘Cause when niggas get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by Five-O
Grandmama came to court with her Bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A, State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?
[Hook]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 3]
Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the 4-4 up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming, but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' them up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Aye, y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
‘Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up
[Hook]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Outro]
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, stop trippin on it
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same25Embed
