Pretty little liar, whatchu gonna say?
Tell me that you love me, lyin' to my face
I know you double-crossed me
Girl, you're such a fake
What a shame, guess my lover was a snake
Pretty little liar, whatcha gonna say?
Tell me that you love me, lyin' to my face
I know you double-crossed me
Girl, you're such a fake
What a shame, guess my lover was a snake
Pretty little liar, whatcha gonna say?
Tell me that you love me, lyin' to my face
I know you double-crossed me
Girl, you're such a fake
What a shame, guess my lover was a snake

[Verse]
Yes, I feel like I'm chokin'
Breaking up 'cause we already broken
Snake emoji on my phone when you callin'
'Cause our love doesn't feel like fallin'
When I cry myself to sleep
I see you in my dreams, I can't breathe
'Bout to hyperventilate
Hiding your phone when you're sleepin'
Stayin' out late on the weekend
Deep down, I knew you were cheatin'
But I didn't wanna believe it
I'm busy fighting my demons, you were so deceivin'
Messin' with my feelings
You were my Garden of Eden
Now, I'm leaving

Tell me that you love me, lyin' to my face
I know you double-crossed me
