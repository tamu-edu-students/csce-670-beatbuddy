16 ContributorsSacrifice Lyrics[Intro: Black Atlass]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Black Atlass]
I will never sacrifice my love
Not even for you
You know I don't play it safe
Sometimes you have to break the rules

[Pre-Chorus: Black Atlass]
Yeah, we could call it love or we could call it nothin'
But you got what I want, so, baby, give me somethin'
Yeah, we could call it love or we could call it nothin'
But you got what I want, you know I do, too

[Chorus: Black Atlass]
So let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
Let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight

[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
Beautiful, mm
How do you make dangerous look so beautiful?
And how come when you kiss, you turn me into this?
I fall in love, oozin' up the way you do that
Don't even got you yet, but I can't imagine losing you

We could call it love or we could call it nothin'
But you got what I want, you know I do, too

[Chorus: Black Atlass & Jessie Reyez]
So let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
Let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
So let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
Let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
