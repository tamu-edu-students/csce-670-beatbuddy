Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

[Verse 2]
A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
See Journey LiveGet tickets as low as $39You might also like[Verse 4]
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlights, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people115Embed Don't Stop Believin' Escape (Bonus Track Version) Journey rock
