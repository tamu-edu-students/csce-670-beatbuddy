06. Shibuya



[In Underground Mall B1, you come across your first Cathedral of Shadows.
These are located throughout the game - you can fuse demons here. You also
come across your first Junk Shop, where you can buy items and Magatama.]

[You enter the club located in Shibuya, and you see a human girl in the
shadows. She walks into the light, and you realize that the girl is Chiaki.]

CHIAKI:
...How should I act at a time like this? ...Should I be happy? Like,
'I'm glad we're both okay.'? It's you, Hero, right?
...I can tell. Don't worry...Nothing phases me anymore. I realized...
No matter how much I cry or shout, this nightmare won't end.
I'm...a little tired. Hero... Do you know what happened to the world?

	
CHOICES
	
	  1)   The Conception occurred.
	
	       The Conception? You mean... What was written in that
	       magazine actually happened?
	       ....
	       ...I see.
	       ...I feel sick to my stomach.
	
	  2)   No, I don't.                                                                                                           :
	       ...I see. I fell unconscious at the hospital.
	       ...and when I woke up, there were demons everywhere.
	       No one was around, and my cell phone didn't work.
	       So, I ran outside for help, but...
	       ...it wasn't just the hospital that had changed.
	
CHIAKI:
You saw how it was out there, right? I couldn't even tell where my house
used to be... I seriously thought that I was the only person still alive.
...I'm so glad to see you, Hero. Maybe...there's still hope. There's got to
be other survivors, don't you think? Ms. Takao and Isamu might be around
somewhere, too. I'll go look for them...I'm not ready to give up entirely.
They must be alive. Fate can't be that cruel. Otherwise...I don't know what
I'll do.

Chiaki left...

[You talk to a Nekomata demon in the club.]

DEMON:
I know the name of the organization in Ginza, meow! Meow! I have an idea!
If you do something naughty with me, I'll tell you the name!

[Will you do something naughty with Nekomata?]

	CHOICES
	
1)   Sounds purrrfect.
	
	       Meow, wonderful!
	
	       --She attacks you. After the fight, she says the
	       following.--
	
	       The organization in Ginza is called the [Assembly of
	       Nihilo].
	
	  2)   Sounds rough.
	
	       Rrreow! You scaredy-cat!
	
[You head back to the surface of Shibuya, and see a Setanta demon.]

DEMON:
A [human male] suddenly appeared at the terminal. He's still snooping
around there yelling, 'I've got it!' every so often.  What's he got?

[You head to the save terminal to investigate.]

[ You can hear sounds coming from inside the room.]
[ Will you enter?]

[You enter and see Hijiri.]

HIJIRI:
Hey...Is that really you? ...I don't know what to say. You came here all by
yourself, on foot!? You must've gained some incredible power! I came here a
little while ago...

[He looks at the barrel-shaped object.]

HIJIRI:
...using this. Remember? You saw one just like it at the hospital. This
isn't an ordinary piece of artwork. It's a truly amazing device. These are
connected to each other by a strange passageway. Using that passageway--the
Amala Network--you can send anything to a distant location instantly. So
basically, I transported myself here from the hospital. I'm guessing that
there are more of these devices in different locations, and that they form
a huge transportation network...And most likely that network is connected
to where Hikawa is.
Hey, wanna work together? If we're gonna have any hope of getting out of
this mess, then we've got to find Hikawa. I heard there's a group in Ginza
that's vying for control of shaping this infant world, and its leader is a
human. That leader's gotta be Hikawa. So...I want you to try and find any
information you can about that group. I'll use this device to send you to
Ginza. ...Well, what do you say? It's definitely risky, but it's better than
wandering around on your own...I'm gonna stay here for a while. Let me know
when you decide what you want to do. But, keep this in mind. I have no idea
what things will be like in Ginza now. If you do decide to go there, make
sure you prepare yourself, alright?

[You prepare youself and talk to Hijiri again]

HIJIRI:
So, did you decide to enter the Amala Network?

[You say 'Yes.']

HIJIRI:
...Alright. Once I send you, I'll head over to Ginza too. Until then...stay
alive. Good luck!

[The strange pillar begins to spin and emit a blue light. You start to
rapidly fly through different corridors. You end up in the Amala Network.]


===============================================================================
07.  Amala Network & Labyrinth of Amala



HIJIRI:
Hey...Can you hear me now? Good. Looks like you're still safe. It seems that
the Link failed and you fell into the Amala Network. But...The Amala Network
is exactly that: a network. If there's an entrance, there's always an exit.
Just leave it to me. I'll get you out, so head toward Ginza...

[You make your way through the Amala Network. Suddenly the stairs you wished
to enter disappear.]

HIJIRI:
...?
Something's up... Are you stuck?

[You say 'Yes.']

HIJIRI:
Okay...I've got an idea. Let me try something...

[The area that disappeared before comes back.]

HIJIRI:
I'm starting to get it... Looks like the Amala Network never stays the same
shape. Even you would have a hard time getting through here... Well, if
something happens, call me. I'll do what I can.

[You travel through the Network a bit more, when another area disappears.]
HIJIRI:
...Geez, again? Hopefully, it'll be as smooth as the last time...
...!
...H..ey.....
Ca..n..yo..hear...e?
Say...som..in...
...Dam..it...!
Conn..ction's..unst..ble...

[You can no longer hear Hijiri's voice.]

[You continue through the Network, reaching an area called an Anomaly.]

[ You can hear a voice...]

VOICE:
...y...he.....y...
It...me.....Hijiri.
...Can you hear me? Answer me! Can you hear me now?

CHOICES

	  1)   I can hear you.
	
	       Good! Looks like you're in a spot that gets good
	       reception.
	
	  2)   I can't hear you.

	       Yeah, real funny....I know you hear me, kid!
	

HIJIRI:
Alright...Let's do it this way. From now on, if anything happens, let's meet
up in stable places like this one you're in right now.
...Oh, yeah. You're stuck, huh? Just wait a...sec...

[The area that disappeared earlier comes back.]

HIJIRI:
...Damn.
Looks like...communica..ion's...
get...ing..ba..d.....he..re..too...
Let...s..meet...u..p...in...
a...nother...stab...le...plac...e...
............
......Okay...?

[ You hear nothing.]

[The next time this happens, three separate areas disappear at once. You
make your way to another Anomaly.]

[You can hear a voice...]

HIJIRI:
.........
It's good to know you're alive. Guess you didn't become a demon for nothing.
You couldn't go any further, huh? Wait up.

[All three areas reappear.]

HIJIRI:
...Oh yeah, there's something you should know. It seems that someone's
trying to intercept my communication with you. Might be an enemy. Be
care...ful...
.....Looks like...it's...get...ing...
...un...stable...he...re...to...o.....
We'll...tal...k...la...er...

[You hear nothing.]

[You eventually come to another Anomaly.]

[You can hear a voice.]

HIJIRI:
You're finally here... The exit is close to where you are. Let me open the--

[The screen starts to shake.]

HIJIRI:
.......!
Damnit, something's interfering...
....He...y...
Yo...u.....ok...ay...?
.....hear...me.....
..........

[You cannot hear Hijiri's voice anymore.]

[A yellow ghost-like creature appears.]

[Specter disappears.]

HIJIRI:
..........
.....Alright...It looks like...everything's stabilizing. Hey, Hero, you
okay?

	     CHOICES

	  1)   Yes.
	
	       I see...You're getting used to being a demon, aren't
	       ya? I'll open the door. Hang on.
	
	  2)   No.
	
	       Alright, I'll do the best I can to get you outta there.


[An exit is revealed.]

HIJIRI:
If you go through the path I opened, you should reach [Ginza] safely. You
did take a slight detour, but at least you're there. Nice work. Now, let's
hurry on.

[You hear nothing.]

[You enter the area Hijiri opened up, and it takes you to a central area.]

[You landed in an unexpected location.]

[You see a strange stalagmite-type thing with several holes in the side.]

[There is a peephole...]
[Will you look inside?]

[You look, and see old-looking eyes flash before you look through the tunnel.]

[You see a stage - a red curtain slowly rises, creaking. A study is revealed,
with the man in the wheelchair and woman in black standing before you.]

LADY IN BLACK:
You have come at last...I knew that fate would bring you here. This is the
farthest region of Amala...Humans call it the netherworld. I am sure you are
already aware, but many formidable demons lurk in this dark land. This place
is home to those who were cast down by god. They await the day when they can
fly once again. Moniker, the young man with the power of a demon...You are
still weak and unable to withstand the flow of Magatsuhi in Amala. You may
be wondering how it is that you arrived here and if you are in danger, but
do not worry. We will send you to your original destination. It is time for
you to return to Tokyo. There is nothing you can accomplish here right now.
At this point, you still lack the strength. But, allow me to give you this.
This [candelabrum] will be your guide...when you lose your way in your quest
for power.

[You obtained the [Candelabrum of Sovereignty].]

LADY IN BLACK:
Then, I will send you to Ginza. We shall meet again, if fate so desires...

[The curtain slowly lowers, creaking again. The screen fades to black. You
end up in a save terminal.]

HIJIRI:
...Hero, can you hear me? I guess you made it to Ginza alright. You had me
worried there... I lost track of you for a while, and I thought you may have
gotten lost in the Amala Network... Anyways, I'm glad to see that you're
okay. So, can you look around Ginza and gather some info about Hikawa? You
might run into tougher demons, but I'm sure you can handle them. I'm not cut
out for fighting, so I'll track down Hikawa some other way. I'm sure we'll
meet again, since we're both after the same thing. Alright then, see ya.

[The voice could no longer be heard.]

[You now have the option of using the Amala Link in save terminals to visit
places you have visited before.]


===============================================================================
08.  Ginza



[You are transported to Ginza. Here there is Rag's Jewelry, where you can
trade gems you find for items, Elementals, and Mitamas. At Ginza's Cathedral
of Shadows, you are now able to perform sacrificial demon fusions at full
Kagutsuchi. You speak to an Eligor demon near Rag's Jewelry.]

DEMON:
The Assembly of Nihilo desires a [world of stillness]. It is a world without
pain, because it is not controlled by emotions...It is far different from
the state of chaos that Tokyo is in right now.

[You enter a bar called Nyx's Lounge.]

SOUL:
The Assembly of Nihilo has a human they call the [Maiden]. She and the
Commander are the ones holding Nihilo together. But, that's not saying much.

MADAM NYX:
Oh? Hey kid. What're you doing in a place like this?
I haven't seen you around before.
Did you come to check out the Assembly of Nihilo?

	 CHOICES

	  1)   Yes.
	
	       ...I knew it. You probably have something for that
	       Maiden, right? ...Nihilo's base of operations is right
	       outside of Ginza. I'd tell you not to try it, but boys
	       love risking their necks for girls. If it doesn't work
	       out, come talk to me again.
	
	  2)   No.
	
	       I see... That's good. It's best not to bother with all
this 'creation' business.


LOKI:
Who the hell are you? Whaddya want in here? Did you come in for a drink?
Sorry kid, but I don't think they serve milk or juice boxes in this place.

[You try to enter the room at the back of Nyx's Lounge.]

LOKI:
Hey! That's [my room]. Don't even think of touching it!

[Outside of the bar again, you talk to a few more souls.]

SOUL:
Did you know? People say that Loki owns a bunch of different things.
He's at Nyx's Lounge.

SOUL:
Nihilo's base is southwest of Ginza...in [Shiodome].

[You see a Queen Mab demon.]

DEMON:
You can't exclude the power of Magatsuhi in creating the world. The Assembly
of Nihilo is using terminals to suck Magatsuhi from the Amala Network. The
Commander is a clever one...Ha ha ha!

[You head to check out the Assembly of Nihilo. When you enter, a Berith demon
stops you.]

BERITH:
Halt! This is the [Assembly of Nihilo], the place for those who seek
silence. I cannot let anyone see our commander or the Maiden. Leave these
grounds immediately!


[He sends you away, so you head back to Ginza to speak to Madam Nyx.]

MADAM NYX:
What? You couldn't get inside the base? Ha! I didn't think you'd actually
be crazy enough to try and go there! ..Is there a reason why you need to
infiltrate the Assembly of Nihilo?

	     CHOICES
	  1)   Yes.
	
	       .........
	       I see... Then, let me tell you something. Go see
	       [Gozu-Tennoh]. Gozu-Tennoh is the leader of the demons
	       in [Ikebukuro]. He's no friend of the Nihilo, so he
	       might help you out. You can get to Ikebukuro from the
	       [Great Underpass of Ginza], just across the bridge from
	       here. Good luck... You're gonna need it.
	
2)   No.
	
	       I see...That's good. It's best not to bother with all
	       this 'creation' business.



===============================================================================
09.  Harumi Warehouse & Great Underpass of Ginza



[You head east on the world map, and you see a soul near a building.]

SOUL:
There's a place to get into the Great Underpass of Ginza somewhere around
here...

[You enter the building, called the Harumi Warehouse. You flip a switch,
which opens a gate that was blocking the entrance. You come across a ladder,
and descend it to enter the Great Underpass of Ginza. After traveling for a
while you enter an open sewer area, where you see a man.]

MAN:
.....Ah!

[You follow the man, and see him again in the next area.]

MAN:
.....Whoa!!

[You run halfway down a passage, and see more people.]

MAN ON THE RIGHT:
.....Ack!! He's this far already!?

MAN ON THE LEFT:
A demon...? Is he a [Mantra] demon?

MAN ON THE RIGHT:
...Huh? Mantra!? Ummmmmm.....
Anyway, let's report this to everyone!

[They disappear and you follow them. You enter a door and see a man standing
in front of you.]

MAN:
.....Ahhh!! H-He's here...!

[You see that there are many of them standing around and above you.]

PEOPLE:
...Th-The demon's here!

PEOPLE:
...Th-The Mantra!?

OLD MAN:
A Mantra demon...
.....It's over.....
...It's all over...
.........
.........
.........?
.....Huh?
.........
Hey, he's not a Mantra! Never seen a demon of the likes of him in their
army! ...I was worried for nothing. Now, I can get back to my rocking chair.
.........
...What?
Are we that peculiar to you?

	   CHOICES

	  1)   Actually, yeah.
	
	       We're [Manikins]. You can probably tell a lot about us
	       just by seeing where we live.
	       ...Now, go home! Everyone else, do the same.
	
	  2)  Not really.
	
	       .........
	       I thought that you'd never seen a [Manikin] before.
	       That was a waste of time...Everyone, back to business!
	

MANIKINS:
Oh.....
I guess he's not a Mantra demon...
...We were worried for nothing.

[ The Manikins returned to their rooms.]

OLD MANIKIN:
...Oh, you again. Is it bothering you that much?

CHOICES
	
1)   Yes.
	
	       .........
	       ...We're Manikins. Our destiny is to be slaves to the
	       demons...But, we can also feel pain, you know. That's
	       why we live in hiding in this underpass.
	       ...Get it? So, please leave us be.
	
	  2)   No.
	
	       ...Then, leave us be.
	

MALE MANIKIN:
We're like the humans, but we're not...
We were made to look like them, for some reason or another. It can't be
helped.

FEMALE MANIKIN:
Many of our fellow Manikins are suffering in Ikebukuro as slaves of the
[Mantra]...Um, the Mantra are a group of demons based in Ikebukuro. Dunno
if you knew...

MALE MANIKIN:
The Mantra and the Assembly of Nihilo oppose each other because their ideals
differ. They have different ideas of how Tokyo should be run, you see.

[You go down a ladder, and come across the junk collector.]

COLLECTOR MANIKIN:
.........
...Hey. Are you that demon everyone is talking about? I'm a collector of
many things, especially things that have to do with humans. So, I leave the
underpass every so often, convincing the gatekeeper to let me through. Well,
if you need some advice, I'll help you... Maybe you could help me collect
'stuff'....

[When you try to pass through a gate in the Underpass that will take you to
Ikebukuro, you are stopped by the gate keeper.]

MANIKIN GATEKEEPER:
Hey! Stop right there. This path leads to Ikebukuro, the base of the Mantra.
It would be real bad if the Mantra came, so I can't open the gate.

[You head back to the junk collector.]

COLLECTOR MANIKIN:
Is something wrong?
..........
...The gatekeeper is preventing you from passing by to get to Ikebukuro,
huh? Would you like me to persuade him to let you through?

CHOICES

	  1)   Yes.
	
	       Alright, I'll persuade the gatekeeper to let you
	       through. But, only on one condition... You have to find
	       something that I'm looking for. I want a [Bill]. It's a
	       small portrait painted by humans in a greenish color.
	       It's small, yet detailed, and it uses watermarking
	       technology that changes patterns... It had value at one
	       time, I think. I heard that some humans valued it more
	       than their lives! I'd like to find one, but I have no
	       clue as to where I can find it. I heard that there were
	       plenty where [people crowded together]....A city,
	       perhaps? Maybe you'll be able to do it. You're a demon,
	       after all. Anyways...I entrust you with finding that
	       Bill.
	
	  2)   No.
	
	       Are you sure? Okay, suit yourself. I doubt you'll be
	       able to get that gatekeeper to let you through. Come
	       back if you change your mind. I'll be here.
	
	       --Speak to him again, and he will say same as before.--
--you must say “yes” for story to progress--


[You head back to the bar in Ginza. You speak to Loki.]

LOKI:
Huh? Is there a [Bill] in my room? Bill, as in human money? It might, it
might not... Heheheh...You want a [Bill]?

	 CHOICES
	
1)   Bill me.                                                :
	
	       You wanna cut a deal? 20,000,000 Macca. Now, whether
	       there's a Bill in my room or not, that's a different
	       question. Whaddya think? Will you pay me 20,000,000
	       Macca?
	
	              A) Bill me.
	
	                  ...You need the money first before you can
	                  say that! I don't have time to deal with
	                  bums. Go home.
	
	              B) No thanks.
	
	                  Heheheh... Well, of course. Then, there's
	                  nothing to talk about. Go home.

	  2)   No thanks.
	
	       I see, then you have no business here. Take a
	       hike, junior.
	

[You head around to the back entrance to Loki's room.]

[The door is locked.]
[Will you unlock it?]

[You say 'Yes.']

[The door is now unlocked.]

[You enter the room, and open a chest containing a [1000 Yen Bill].]

[When you leave, the Troll that had been guarding the door is standing in
front of you.]

DEMON GUARD:
Hmmmmmmmmmmm!! You!! What were you doing while I was gone!?
Hmmmmmmmmmmm!! It's time for you to die!!

[You fight the Troll. After beating him, you go back to the junk collector
in the Great Underpass of Ginza.]

COLLECTOR MANIKIN:
*gasp* A real BILL!!! We had a deal, right? C'mon, c'mon!
Oh, this is great!!!

[You handed over the [Bill].]

COLLECTOR MANIKIN:
As I said, a deal's a deal. Hold on a sec.
...Here you go. Give this [letter] to the gatekeeper.
This should get you through.

[You obtained the [Manikin's letter].]

COLLECTOR MANIKIN:
See you later...I hope you get to Ikebukuro safely.

[You go back to the Manikin guarding the gate.]

MANIKIN GATEKEEPER:
How many times do I have to tell you? I can't let you pass...
.........
...What's this?

[You gave the gatekeeper the [Manikin's Letter].]

MANIKIN GATEKEEPER:
...? A letter from him?
.........
.........?
.........!
.........
...I got it. If that's the case, it can't be helped.
...Go ahead and pass.

[He opens the gate.]

MANIKIN GATEKEEPER:
Ask me anytime if you want to get through.

[You enter the next area, and a message flashes on the screen.]

[The flames of the [Candelabrum of Sovereignty] are flickering wildly...]
[You can feel the presence of a terrifying demon...]

MYSETERIOUS VOICE:
The flames of the candelabrum beckon me to the battlefield! I do not know
who you are, but...If you have a candelabrum, it is our destiny to fight.
Let us duel to the death within my realm, where no one can interrupt us!

[You are sucked through the floor. You enter a strange realm where the sky
is yellow and orange.]

MYSTERIOUS VOICE:
...Only one of us will escape this domain alive. The victor shall claim the
loser's candelabrum, and return in triumph. You hold a candelabrum...Then,
like me, you must be seeking supreme power.

[The Matador appears.]

That I cannot allow. Only the greatest warrior is worthy of such power. It
is meant for a master swordsman...one who, amidst blood and applause, has
put an end to countless lives...That warrior is I, Matador. It's unfortunate
that we have no spectators, but I believe this will be an excellent show
regardless, as you and I contend for the candelabra. I'm sorry to say, but
it seems you are rather weak to be in possession of a candelabrum. You
should give it to someone more deserving, like myself... But, since it's
unlikely that you'll heed my advice...

[He raises his sword.]

I challenge you to a duel, to see which of us is truly worthy of the
candelabra... I swear, by my sword and capote, that I will once again prove
victorious! Now, let the battle begin!

[You fight him.]

[You obtained the [Candelabrum of Foundation].]
[You hear a familiar voice.]

LADY'S VOICE:
...So, those holding candelabra did attract each other... Hero, I have a
favor to ask of you. There is no hurry, but could you bring your candelabrum
to us? I will allow you access to the [Labyrinth of Amala] from the terminal.
I will explain the details once you arrive. Until then, please make sure you
do not lose the candelabrum...

[You can no longer hear the lady's voice.]

[The Labyrinth of Amala is now available through the save terminal. See the
'Labyrinth of Amala Sidequest' area for the rest of the boss fights and story
associated with the Labyrinth of Amala.]

[You go through the rest of the Underpass, and come out in Zoshigaya Cemetery.
You make your way to Ikebukuro.]


===============================================================================
10.  Ikebukuro & Mantra Headquarters



[In Ikebukuro, you speak to two Manikins.]

MANIKIN:
The tall building up ahead is the [headquarters] of the Mantra. You
shouldn't go near it.

MALE MANIKIN:
The Mantra demons rampage about, doing whatever their instincts tell them
to. I'm jealous.

[You walk up to the door of Mantra Headquarters.--]

[You can hear a voice coming from inside...]

VOICE:
...What the hell?! I didn't do anything...
...........
...........

[You cannot hear the voice anymore.]
[Will you enter the Mantra's headquarters?]

[When you enter, you see Isamu arguing with Thor.]

ISAMU:
Wh-Whaddya want!? I didn't do anything! You hear me!?

[Isamu turns around, looking shocked.]

ISAMU:
Oh great, there's more...? H-Hey... Is that you, Hero!?

[As he is speaking, you see Thor raise his hammer.]

ISAMU:
You gotta help me!
I can't afford to waste any time!

It's Ms. Takao!!
She's...!

[Thor hits Isamu on the head with his hammer. Isamu is slammed against a
pillar. Thor grabs Isamu's head and pulls Magatsuhi from his body. Isamu
collapses, and Thor raises his fist.]

THOR:
You are unfamiliar to me, demon. Any who enter the territory of the Mantra
will be tried. Lock him up!

[Thor begins to walk away, and some Nue demons come toward you. The screen
fades to black.]

DEMON GUARD:
Hey! Wake up!

[You are now in a prison cell.]

DEMON GUARD:
Stop sleeping! You're about to be escorted to court! A trial decided by
power... If you claim to be innocent, then pound your enemy into the ground!
When he is just a quivering mass of flesh, you'll be set free. Hahahahaha...!

[You examine one wall of your cell.]

[You can hear a voice from the other side...]

VOICE:
Oh, a newcomer?
You were probably thrown in here for a crime that you didn't commit, right?
But, reason won't work with those Mantra guys! You probably figured that out
already. If you want to get out of here, you'll have to impress them with
your brute strength.

[You examine the other wall of your cell.]

[You can hear a voice from the other side...]

VOICE:
Let me out of here! The Mantra are crazy! I can't fight. Someone, save me!

[A Pyro Jack demon comes up to your cell.]

DEMON GUARD:
We're beginning the hearing. Get out.

[He raises the cell door and you walk to the trial area.]

DEMON JUDGE:
We will now hold a hearing according to the rules of the Mantra.
I call upon the defendant, Moniker. Please come to the arena.

[You walk forward, and the door closes behind you.]

DEMON JUDGE:
Moniker...You are charged with loitering in Ikebukuro and entering our
headquarters. On top of that, demons saw you in the Great Underpass. You may
be a Nihilo spy... I further charge you with being a little sneak. Ikebukuro
is the territory of the Mantra! Even if you are a newcomer, it is crime
enough that you've shown us such flagrant disrespect!

[Orthrus appears.]

ORTHRUS:
I SHALL PASS RIGHTEOUS JUDGEMENT...CAPITAL PUNISHMENT! THERE IS NO OTHER
CHOICE. THINK OF HOW YOU WANT TO DIE. I'LL GIVE YOU TIME.

[When you are ready, you fight him. Next, Yaksini appears.]

YAKSINI:
Just beating Orthrus isn't going to overturn the decision. Your strength is
death... Ahh... I want to cut you up right now! But, I'll give you some
time. Make it fun for me.

[When you are ready, you fight Yaksini. After the battle, the room starts to
shake.]

DEMON JUDGE:
It's finally time...

[Thor appears.]

THOR:
I am Thor. I commend your ability to fight. But...Will your power work
against me? My hammer shall be the judge. I will give you time to prepare.

[When you are ready, you choose to fight him.]

THOR:
Show me your strength!!

[You fight him. He speaks to you after the battle.]

THOR:
............
You have done well. It seems that you have something other demons do not.
...This is for keeping me interested.

[You obtained the Magatama [Narukami].]

THOR:
...Go and see [Gozu-Tennoh]. Our leader, Gozu-Tennoh, aims to build a
utopia where only the strong may live. Gozu-Tennoh is at the top of this
building. Your power may change the world. Remember that. Judge, Moniker
is innocent. I give my word.

DEMON JUDGE:
Huh!? Innocent? ...O-Okay!! ...I-I have... reached a verdict...
By the order of Thor...No, out of respect for your power, Moniker...
...I hereby declare you innocent!

[The door opens behind you.]

DEMON JUDGE:
...This court is adjourned! The defendant may now be released!

[You are now outside of Mantra Headquarters.]

DEMON GUARD:
Ha! You lucked out, fool. I can't believe Thor approved your release...
Now, get lost!

[The guard goes back to the door.]

DEMON GUARD:
...Oh, yeah. Thor says that you've proved your strength. You're free to
enter our headquarters anytime. That really pisses me off!

[You head back toward Mantra Headquarters, and a message appears on screen.]

[The flames of the [Candelabrum of Sovereignty] are flickering wildly...]

[As you approach the Headquarters, a man in red who is standing on top of
the Headquarters speaks to you.]

MYSTERIOUS MAN:
There you are, Fiend. Let's see what you've got.

[He jumps head first toward you, yet somehow lands on his feet.]

MYSTERIOUS MAN:
Glad to meet you, kid. I hope you feel the same.

[You begin to fight him.]

MYSTERIOUS MAN:
I'll give you ten minutes to decide.
Which would you rather end up in...a coffin or a dumpster?

[After the battle, he speaks to you some more.]

MYSTERIOUS MAN:
Not bad. You look like a demon...but you don't seem like one.  My name is
Dante. I'm a demon slayer.

DANTE:
This old guy asked me to hunt down guys like you, but...

[He points at you with his sword.]

...Forget it. Let's just stop this battle here. I need to find out what that
guy really has in mind. Depending on how things turn out, maybe we'll meet
again. Until then, try and keep yourself alive...Who knows? Maybe I'll have
another chance to kill you.

[Dante walks away. You enter the Mantra Headquarters and make your way to
the top floor.]

[You sense a strong presence from beyond the door.]

[You enter a large room. You see a Manikin on the floor.]

MANIKIN:
Ooooohhh...

[The Manikin begins to convulse and chant.]

[Heaven and earth tremble]
[when the almighty]
[descends from above:]
[god's coming echoes]
[across the land...]

[He raises his arms. You see a huge statue. The statue's eyes begin to glow
yellow.]

HUGE STATUE:
Welcome, Moniker. I am Gozu-Tennoh. As the head of the Mantra, I lead the
demons that gather here.

GOZU-TENNOH:
I was truly impressed by your battle. The emergence of a new, mighty
demon... It is remarkable indeed. But first, let me reward you. Please
accept this gift.

[You received power from Gozu-Tennoh]
[You can now employ 2 additional demons.]

GOZU-TENNOH:
Hahahaha! Do you feel the power coursing through your body? If you choose to
serve me, I shall grant you even greater power... Joining the Mantra doesn't
seem like a bad idea, does it? What say you?

	 CHOICES

	  1)   I'm at your service.
	
	       Hahahaha!! Very well, then! I have some work for our
	       new member of the Mantra.
	
	  2)   I decline.
	
	       Hm... Hahaha... Hahahhahaha!! Not enough Magatsuhi
	       to sate your thirst? You are quite a greedy one.
	       Insatiable greed is a demon's virtue, however. I am
	       sure you will grow stronger without my guidance...But,
	       do not dare to oppose me. If you do...You can imagine
	       the consequences.
	
	  3)   Let me think about it.
	
	       Hmm... Indecisive, are you? If you serve me, I can
	       release your innate power...I can see that you are
	       interested in the Mantra, but not totally convinced.
	       If that is the case...you may observe us first, and
	       then decide. Although, I believe your destiny is to
	       fight alongside us.
	
GOZU-TENNOH
Now... as you may already know, our enemy is the Assembly of Nihilo. They
are threatening us with their plot to bring the world to a halt. We can no
longer overlook their madness. I have made the decision. We, the Mantra,
will wage war on Nihilo, and obliterate them! I have already ordered my
soldiers to attack their headquarters in Ginza. If you call yourself a
demon (--or “If you consider yourself a Mantra” if you chose “I'm at your
service.”--), make haste and go to Ginza. Crush those who pose a threat to
the world! I am Gozu-Tennoh, the one who will rule the kingdom of chaos...

[You are sent outside the room, and you leave the Headquarters. You use the
Amala Link to go back to Ginza, and make your way to the Assembly of Nihilo.]Embed
