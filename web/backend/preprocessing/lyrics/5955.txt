3 ContributorsMy All Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cuz I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel your body next to mine
'Cuz I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for you love tonight

[Verse 2]
Baby can you feel me?
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel your body next to mine
'Cuz I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for you love tonight
You might also like[Outro]
Plеase, stay, I can't go on without this
