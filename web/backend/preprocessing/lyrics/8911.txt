48 ContributorsThe Unforgiven III Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

[Chorus]
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

[Verse 2]
These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
His sinking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground, like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with his ship
Fading in the shadows
Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

[Bridge]
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?

[Verse 3]
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
[Chorus]
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?24Embed The Unforgiven III Death Magnetic Metallica hard-rock
