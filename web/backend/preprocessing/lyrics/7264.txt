30 ContributorsZanzibar Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ali dances and the audience applauds
Though he's bathed in sweat, he hasn't lost his style
Ali, don't you go downtown
You gave away another round for free, woah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Me, I'm just another face at Zanzibar
But the waitress always serves a secret smile, woah
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me
For me

[Chorus]
I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight, that's where I'll be
I'll be

[Verse 2]
Rose, he knows he's such a credit to the game
But the Yankees grab the headlines every time
Melodrama's so much fun
In black and white for everyone to see, woah

Me, I'm trying just to get to second base
And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign, woah
She's gonna give the go ahead
The inning isn't over yet for me
For me

[Chorus]
I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight, that's where I'll be, I'll be

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Tell the waitress I'll come back to Zanzibar
I'll be hiding in the darkness with my beer, woah
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me
For me

[Chorus]
I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight, that's where I'll be, I'll be
