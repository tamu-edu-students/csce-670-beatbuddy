11 ContributorsKiss Me Slowly Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stay with me
Baby, stay with me
Tonight, don't leave me alone (Me alone)
Walk with me
Come and walk with me
To the edge of all we've ever known (we've ever known)
I can see you there with the city lights
Fourteenth floor, pale blue eyes
I can breathe you in
Two shadows standing by the bedroom door
No, I could not want you more than I did right then
As our heads leaned in

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed, all I see
Is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you and the streets below
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby, don't run
Just kiss me slowly

[Verse 2]
Stay with me
Baby, stay with me
Tonight, don't leave me alone (Me alone)
She shows me everything she used to know
Picture frames and country roads
When the days were long and the world was small
She stood by as it fell apart
Separate rooms and broken hearts
But I won't be the one to let you go, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed, all I see
Is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you and the streets below
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby, don't run
Just kiss me slowly
Don't run away

[Bridge]
And it's hard to love again
When the only way it's been
When the only love you knew
Just walked away
If it's something that you want
Darling, you don't have to run
You don't have to go
Just stay with me, baby, stay with me

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed, all I see
Is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you and the streets below (Don't let go)
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby, don't run
Just kiss me slowly
I'm not sure where this is gonna go
But in this moment, all I know
Is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you and the streets below (Baby, don't let go)
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby, don't run
Just kiss me slowly4Embed
