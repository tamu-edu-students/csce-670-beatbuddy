30 ContributorsI Like Him Lyrics[Intro: Denzel Curry]
Got the beat by Powers and we just made a banger

[Chorus]
I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too
I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too

[Verse 1]
Hop in the whip, hop in the truck
I do whatever the fuck that I want
I'm not a ho, I'm not a slut
I like to fuck and I sure like to suck
I am that bold, freezy like ice
I'm not a wife, so talk to me nice
You ain't my type, I don't like you
You a broke boy, look at your shoes
I am the player and I am the pimp
All of them boys, make 'em the trick
All of them boys, they on my shit
But all of them boys, they make me sick
You might also like[Refrain]
I do not see you taming me
'Less them, they're entertaining me
They just tryna p-play with me
Play with me, you gon' pay the fee

[Chorus]
I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too
I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too

[Verse 2]
Dibble in this, and dibble in that
Get on his head like I am a brat
Play with his balls when he up to bat
Make daddy real proud like I'm Kyla Pratt
I'm taking a shower, he makin' the bed
When I leave the city, I leave him on read
Go get the next, like I get the bread
He coming with questions, I call him the feds
He let me plead the fifth
'Cause he know this box a gift
Eating breakfast, not at Tiff'
When I curve him he get stiff
I go beast mode
Ball like free throw
Game like cheat code
Pounds like kilo
[Chorus]
I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too
I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too

[Refrain]
I do not see you taming me
'Less them, they're entertaining me
They just tryna p-play with me
Play with me, you gon' pay the fee36Embed I Like Him Everything Sucks Princess Nokia alternative
