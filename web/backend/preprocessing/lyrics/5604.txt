15 ContributorsJet Lag Lyrics[Intro: Pierre Bouvier]
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
So jet-lagged

[Verse 1: Pierre Bouvier & Natasha Bedingfield]
What time is it where you are?
I miss you more than anything
And back at home you feel so far
Waiting for the phone to ring
It's getting lonely living upside down
I don't even wanna be in this town
Tryna figure out the time zone's making me crazy

[Chorus 1: Pierre Bouvier]
You say good morning when it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset, and it's driving me mad
I miss you so bad, and my heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged

[Verse 2: Pierre Bouvier & Natasha Bedingfield, Both]
What time is it where you are?
Five more days and I'll be home
I keep your picture in my car
I hate the thought of you alone
I've been keeping busy all the time
Just to try to keep you off my mind
Tryna figure out the time zone's making me crazy

You say good morning when it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset, and it's driving me mad
I miss you so bad, and my heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged

[Bridge: Pierre Bouvier & Natasha Bedingfield, Both]
I miss you so bad (I miss you so bad)
I miss you so bad (I miss you so bad)
I miss you so bad (I wanna share your horizon)
I miss you so bad, and see the same sun rising
I miss you so bad and turn the hour hand back to when you were holding me

[Chorus 2: Pierre Bouvier & Natasha Bedingfield]
You say good morning when it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset, and it's driving me mad
I miss when you say good morning, but it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up, to your sunset
And it's drivin' me mad, I miss you so bad
And my heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged3Embed Jet Lag (feat. Natasha Bedingfield) Get Your Heart On! (Deluxe Edition) Simple Plan;Natasha Bedingfield punk-rock
