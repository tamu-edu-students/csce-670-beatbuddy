The smiles as she walked in the room
Have all turned into frowns

And, "If you loved me–"
And I interrupted, received a scowl and stare

Docked in tempestuous bays
Or at least that's how it felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier
And whether you're asleep or awake

It just hit me, we can't go back
To the chest touching on the back21Embed Too Much To Ask Fluorescent Adolescent Arctic Monkeys garage
