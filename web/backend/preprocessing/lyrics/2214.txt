34 ContributorsShe Hates Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

[Pre-Chorus]
In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

[Chorus]
She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

[Verse 2]
She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling of bad, no
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

[Chorus]
She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

[Bridge]
That's my story, as you see
Learned my lesson and so did she
Now it's over and I'm glad
Cause I'm a fool for all I've said

[Chorus]
She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away
[Outro]
La la la la la la la la la love
Trust
La la la la la la la la la love
Trust
La la la la la la la la la love
And she tore my feelings like I had none
La la la la la la la la la love
She fucking hates me9Embed
