7 ContributorsRide Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's closer to midnight
Still talking just us two
Surrounded by the stars
Oh they're shining just for you
It's getting colder, baby
Let me keep you warm all night
Tell me what you wanna do
'Cause baby, I'm all for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come and ride with me tonight

[Chorus]
Please don't you go, I'll be alone
Wait until the morning
I'll hold you close
Please don't you go, I'll be alone
Wait until the morning
Ride until it's dawning

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight, girl
It's way too unbelievable
I know I'm the lucky one
Wonder what I've done
To deserve you?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Come and ride with me tonight

[Chorus]
Please don't you go, I'll be alone
Wait until the morning
I'll hold you close
Please don't you go, I'll be alone
Wait until the morning
Ride until it's dawning

[Chorus]
Please don't you go (Please don't you go)
I'll be alone (I'll be alone)
Wait until the morning (Wait until the morning)
I'll hold you close (I will hold you close)
Please don't you go (Please don't you go)
I'll be alone (I'll be alone)
Wait until the morning (Wait until the morning)
Ride until it's dawning (Ride until it's dawning)Embed
