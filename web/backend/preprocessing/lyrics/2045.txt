Buffalo soldier, dreadlocked rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
I mean it, when I analyse the stench
To me it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlocked rasta was a Buffalo Soldier

[Verse 2]
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said it was a Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America

[Verse 3]
If you know your history
Then you would know where you're coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the 'eck do I think I am

[Verse 4]
I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, in the war for America
