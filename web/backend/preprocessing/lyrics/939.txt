44 ContributorsSomeone To You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna die or fade away
I just wanna be someone
I just wanna be someone
Dive and disappear without a trace
I just wanna be someone
Well, doesn't everyone?
And if you feel the great dividing
I wanna be the one you're guiding
'Cause I believe that you could lead the way

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be somebody to someone, oh
I wanna be somebody to someone, oh
I never had nobody and no road home
I wanna be somebody to someone

[Chorus]
And if the sun starts setting, the sky goes cold
Then if the clouds get heavy and start to fall
I really need somebody to call my own
I wanna be somebody to someone
Someone to you
Someone to you
Someone to you
Someone to you (Someone to you)

I don't even need to change the world (Change, change the world)
I'll make the moon shine just for your view
I'll make the starlight circle the room (Circle the room)
And if you feel like night is falling
I wanna be the one you're calling
'Cause I believe that you could lead the way

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be somebody to someone, oh
I wanna be somebody to someone, oh
I never had nobody and no road home
I wanna be somebody to someone

[Chorus]
And if the sun starts setting, the sky goes cold
Then if the clouds get heavy and start to fall
I really need somebody to call my own
I wanna be somebody to someone
Someone to you
Someone to you
Someone to you
Someone to you

[Bridge]
The kingdom come, the rise, the fall
The setting sun above it all
I just wanna be somebody to you
[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be somebody to someone, oh
I wanna be somebody to someone, oh
I never had nobody and no road home
I wanna be somebody to someone

[Chorus]
And if the sun starts setting, the sky goes cold
Then if the clouds get heavy and start to fall
I really need somebody to call my own
I wanna be somebody to someone
Someone to you
Someone to you
Someone to you
Someone to you

[Outro]
