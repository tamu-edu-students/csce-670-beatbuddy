101 ContributorsTwin Size Mattress Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is for the lions living in the wiry, broke-down frames of my friends' bodies
When the floodwater comes, it ain't gonna be clear; it's gonna look like mud
But I will help you swim
I will help you swim, I'm gonna help you swim

[Verse 2]
This is for the snakes and the people they bite
For the friends I've made, for the sleepless nights
For the warning signs I've completely ignored
There's an amount to take, reasons to take more
It's no big surprise you turned out this way
When they closed their eyes and prayed you would change
And they cut your hair and sent you away
You stopped by my house the night you escaped
With tears in my eyes, I begged you to stay
You said, "Hey, man, I love you, but no fucking way"

[Chorus]
I'm sure that we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies

[Verse 3]
This is for the lake that me and my friends swim in
Naked and dumb on a drunken night
And it should've felt good, but I could hear the Jaws theme song
On repeat in the back of my mind
Make sure you kiss your knuckles before you punch me in the face
There are lessons to be learned, and consequences for all the stupid things I say
And it is no big surprise you turned out this way
The spark in your eyes, the look on your face
I will not be brave

I'm sure that we could find something for you to do on stage

[Bridge]
I wanna contribute to the chaos
I don't wanna watch and then complain
'Cause I am through finding blame
That is a decision that I have made

[Coda]
She hopes I'm cursed forever
To sleep on a twin-size mattress
In somebody's attic or basement my whole life
Never graduating up in size to add another
And my nightmares will have nightmares every night
Oh, every night, every night60Embed Twin Size Mattress Talon Of The Hawk The Front Bottoms j-rock
