24 ContributorsWHY AM I Waiting Lyrics[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone?
Who doesn’t give a fuck about me?

[Verse]
I'm in a lot of pain, but I act like it don’t hurt

Swear, I put so much energy and it don't work
Fell in love with your vibe and all your culture
And when I think about you, do you think about me?
And I'm talking about the same way
I always lose, but never lose the fight
Even if I'm in the same place
Like yes, I'm in love, I acknowledge it

All of the time in my heart, in my mind
You're just calling, I’m on it bae
Heard ’bout your ex's i see they be tripping
I know it’s cliche but, believe me, I'm different
Mixing emotions with all I've been sippin'
My heart always speaking but you never listen, my--

[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty]
Tell me why I am waiting for someone?
Who doesn’t give a fuck about me?
Who doesn't give a fuck about me?You might also like4Embed
