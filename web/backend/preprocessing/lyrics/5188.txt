No dragon could defeat me, no fears annoy
Sitting on my daddy's shoulders, high up and safe
Shielded in my blanket cave

Memories of innocence
Filling me with joy
Take me back and let me be
That carefree little boy

Take me home Oh
Take me home Oh
To that peaceful valley
Don't wanna roam

Take me home Oh
Take me home Oh
Take me back in time
To my childhood home

I remember
No dragon could defeat me
Sitting on my daddy's shoulders
Shielded in my blanket cave

I remember seeing raindrops on the car
Race against each other like a flickering star
Sleeping on the backseat with no sorrow on my mind
Leaving all my thoughts behind

Filling me with joy
Take me back and let me be
That carefree little boy

Take me home Oh
Take me home Oh
To that peaceful valley
Don't wanna roam

Take me home Oh
Take me home Oh
Take me back in time
To my childhood homeEmbed
