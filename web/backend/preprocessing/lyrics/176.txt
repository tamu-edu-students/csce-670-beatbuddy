And said drink from me, drink from me
(I, oh, I, oh, I)
That we shoot across the sky
Got me feeling drunk and high
Poured on a symphony
So high, so high
That we shoot across the sky
Poured on a symphony
Drink from me, drink from me
(I, oh, I, oh, I)
That we shoot across the sky
Got me feelin' drunk and high
Poured on a symphony
So high, so high
That we shoot across the sky

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

I said, drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high (Woo)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Chris Martin, Chris Martin & Beyoncé, Beyoncé]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars (Stars) come out

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin, Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high

I, oh, I, oh, I
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, so high, so high
I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
