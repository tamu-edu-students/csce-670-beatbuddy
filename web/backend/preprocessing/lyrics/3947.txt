Freedom, la-la-la-la
Freedom, follow me
Freedom, la-la-la-la
Freedom, cut it!
Freedom, la-la-la-la
Freedom, follow me
Freedom, la-la-la-la
Freedom

[Verse 1: Brent Smith]
Let me tell you: I'm vicious
Not passive-aggressive
I've got my finger on the pulse
Starin' straight into a hole, and I get it
And I'm a savage; it's automatic
I got a way of makin' noise
The power to destroy with no static

[Pre-Chorus: Brent Smith]
'Cause victory is all you need
So, cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten
Just count to ten

[Chorus: Brent Smith]
I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness!)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty...

[Verse 2: Brent Smith]
You gotta feel courage
Embrace possession
If it was easier to shatter everything that ever mattered
But it's not, because it's your obsession
Be a fighter, backbone desire
Complicated, and it stings
But we both know what it means
And it's time to get real and inspired

[Pre-Chorus: Brent Smith]
'Cause victory is all you need
So, cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten
Just count to ten
Just count to ten

[Chorus: Brent Smith]
I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness!)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty...
[Bridge: Brent Smith]
Cut the cord!
Cut it!
Cut it!
