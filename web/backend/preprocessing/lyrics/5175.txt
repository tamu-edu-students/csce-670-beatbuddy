Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly, you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad

[Chorus]
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

[Verse 2]
Thought of you as my mountaintop
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had but couldn't keep
I've had but couldn't keep

[Chorus]
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

[Verse 3]
If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in the mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me
You might also like[Chorus]
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

[Verse 4]
Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
She said, "Money is like us in time
It lies but can't stand up
Down for you is up"

[Chorus]
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

[Verse 5]
It was good what we did yesterday
And I'll do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

[Chorus]
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes23Embed Pale Blue Eyes The Velvet Underground (45th Anniversary) The Velvet Underground folk
