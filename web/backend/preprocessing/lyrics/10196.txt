8 ContributorsForever & Always Lyrics[Verse 1: Owl City]
Nothing left here in this town
All of life has been shut down
Take the last flight out tonight
Set a course for the moonlight
Say goodnight, city lights
Watch as they fade from sight

[Pre-Chorus: Owl City]
I would follow you to the end
Take a bullet again and again

[Chorus: Owl City]
And if we should die tonight
There'd be two more stars in the sky
'Cause I would follow you to the end
Forever and always (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Forever and always
There'd be two more stars in the sky
'Cause I would follow you to the end
Forever and always

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Owl City]
And if we should die tonight
There'd be two more stars in the sky
'Cause I would follow you to the end
Forever and always
You might also like[Verse 2: Owl City]
The empty world we left behind
Is still so lonely in my mind
But touching down on a new day
With breaking waves guiding our way
An ocean bay hideaway telling us that we could stay

[Pre-Chorus: Owl City]
I would follow you to the end
Take a bullet again and again

[Chorus: Owl City]
And if we should die tonight
There'd be two more stars in the sky
'Cause I would follow you to the end
Forever and always (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Owl City]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) And if we should die tonight
There'd be two more stars in the sky
'Cause I would follow you to the end
Forever and always1Embed
