Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red, out of her head, she sang

[Verse 2]
Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder
When I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

[Verse 3]
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now, I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head, I sang

When I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when127Embed Everlong The Colour And The Shape Foo Fighters alternative
