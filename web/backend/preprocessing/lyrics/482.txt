Yo, let's do that song for Peep
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down, yeah
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town (oh-oh, oh-oh)
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Rain keeps fallin', tears keep fallin'
Rain keeps fallin', tears keep fallin'
Darlin', your love is like walking a bed of nails
And I just can't keep on fightin'
Oh, oh, oh
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town (oh-oh, oh-oh)
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (oh-oh, oh-oh)

'Cause your remorse kinda makes you check 'em out
Darlin', your love is like walking a bed of nails
