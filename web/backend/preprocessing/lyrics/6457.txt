6 ContributorsKing of My Heart (Live) Lyrics[Verse 1: Steffany Gretzinger]
Let the King of my heart
Be the mountain where I run
The fountain I drink from
Oh, He is my song
And let the King of my heart
Be the shadow where I hide
The ransom for my life
Oh, He is my song

[Chorus: Steffany Gretzinger]
Yes, You are good
You're good, oh-oh
You are good
You're good, oh-oh
You are good
You're good, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You are good
You're good, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Steffany Gretzinger]
And let the King of my heart
Be the wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves
Oh-oh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the fire inside my veins
The echo of my days
Oh-oh, He is my song (Oh, sing it again)
Let the King of my heart
Be the wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves
Oh-oh, He is my song (Oh, I know)
Let the King of my heart
Be the fire inside my veins
The echo of my days
Oh, He is my song
