28 ContributorsWhat He Wrote Lyrics[Verse 1]
Forgive me, Hera
I cannot stay
He cut out my tongue
There is nothing to save
Love me, oh Lord
He threw me away
He laughed at my sins
In his arms, I must stay

[Chorus]
He wrote
I am broke
Please send for me
But I am broken too
And spoken for
Do not tempt me

[Verse 2]
Her skin is white
And I'm light as the sun
So holy light shines
On the things you have done
So I asked him how he became this man
How did he learn to hold fruit in his hands?
And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
He had to leave, though I begged him to stay
Left me alone when I needed the light
Fell to my knees and I wept for my life
If he had've stayed, you might understand
If he had've stayed, you never would have taken my hand
You might also like[Chorus]
He wrote
I'm low
Please send for me
But I am broken too
And spoken for
Do not tempt me

[Post-Chorus]
And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
He had to leave, though I begged him to stay

[Verse 3]
Begged him to stay in my cold wooden grip
Begged him to stay by the light of this ship
Me fighting him, fighting light, fighting dawn
And the waves came and stole him and took him to war

[Chorus]
He wrote
I'm broke
Please send for me
But I am broken too
And spoken for
Do not tempt me
[Verse 4]
Forgive me, Hera
I cannot stay
Cut out my tongue
There is nothing to save
Love me, oh Lord
He threw me away
He laughed at my sins
In his arms, I must stay

[Chorus]
We write
That's alright
I miss his smell
We speak when spoken to
And that suits us well
That suits us well
That suits me well10Embed What He Wrote I Speak Because I Can Laura Marling british
