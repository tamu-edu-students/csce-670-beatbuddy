You told me something when I left but I don't remember
Maybe 'cause all I could do then was stare at the floor
I held myself 'cause you wouldn't, all wrapped in my sweatshirt
Wonder if you even noticed that that one was yours

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I should've but I never told you, "I'm sorry"
Know that I tried but my words always got in the way

[Chorus]
Could you hold me without any talking?
We could try to go back where we started
I don't even have to stay
I don't even have to stay but
If I woke up with you in the morning
I'd forget all the ways that we're broken
I don't care if you've changed
I don't even have to stay, huh

[Verse 2]
I don't remember the last time I heard from your sister
Didn't expect to but I sorta thought that I would
Wish I could tell you by now that I felt more indifferent
Catch myself thinking about you more than I should
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I should've but I never told you, "I miss you"
I almost said it but don't know if you feel the same

[Chorus]
Could you hold me without any talking?
We could try to go back where we started
I don't even have to stay
I don't even have to stay but
If I woke up with you in the morning
I'd forget all the ways that we're broken
I don't care if you've changed
I don't even have to stay, huh6Embed
