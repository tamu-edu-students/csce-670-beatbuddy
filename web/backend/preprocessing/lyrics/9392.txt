I can't escape it
I'm never gonna make it out of this in time
I guess that's just fine
I'm not there quite yet
My thoughts, such a mess
Like a little boy
What you runnin' for?

[Pre-Chorus]
Arrive at the door
Anyone home?
Have I lost it all?

[Chorus]
Struck me like a chord
I'm a lonely boy
Holding out the knife
Lonely afterlife
You begged me not to go
Sinkin' like a stone
Use me like an oar
And get yourself to shore

[Verse 2]
A bang at the door
Anyone home?
That's just what they do
Right in front of you
Like a cannonball
Slammin' through your wall
In their face, I saw
What they're fightin' for
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I can't escape it
I'm never gonna make it 'til the end, I guess

[Chorus]
Struck me like a chord
I'm a lonely boy
Holding out the knife
Lonely afterlife
Bangin' on the door
I don't wanna know
Sinkin' like a stone
So use me like an oar

[Bridge]
Hard to fight what I can't see
Not tryna build no dynasty
I can't see beyond this wall
But we lost this game
So many times before

[Non-Lyrical Bridge]

[Outro]
I've been on a cold road
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise
I've been on a cold road
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise27Embed At The Door The New Abnormal The Strokes garage
