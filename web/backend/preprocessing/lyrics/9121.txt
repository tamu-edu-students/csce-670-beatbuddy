The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

[Verse 1]
Here we are at the end of the road
A road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't
We don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, how we got this far

[Chorus]
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

[Post-Chorus]
The kids in the dark

Here we are at the top of the hill
A hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard

[Chorus]
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

[Bridge]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa (The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
Whoa, whoa
[Chorus]
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

[Outro]
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark24Embed
