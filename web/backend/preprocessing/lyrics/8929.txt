One, two, three

[Verse 1]
If you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out
And say hello to never

[Chorus]
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
But if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again

[Verse 2]
If you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the wineglass out
And drink a toast to never

[Chorus]
Oh, someday I know someone will look into my eyes
And say hello, you're my very special one
But if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again

Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars
And the people on subways and trains
Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed
Oh, but people look well in the dark

[Verse 3]
And if you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out
And say hello to never

[Chorus]
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
'Cause if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again

[Outro]
I'd never have to see the day again, once more
I'd never have to see the day again20Embed After Hours The Velvet Underground (45th Anniversary) The Velvet Underground psych-rock
