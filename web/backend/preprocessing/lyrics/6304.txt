Leave me alone, just leave me alone
I'm growin' so tired of this
How do you fight the feelin'?
How do you fight the feelin', bitch? (Bitch)
She callin' my phone, she callin' my phone
I put it on quiet quick (Quick)
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone, girl

[Verse]
I'm all on my own, I'm all on my own
I know you ain't high as this (What)
Puttin' my mind to shit
Give me some time, I be flyin', bitch (Bitch)
Breakin' my bones, you breakin' my bones
You want me to line my wrist
I ain't gon' do it for you
I'm gon' do it for me 'cause it help me forget
I ain't gon' do it for you
I'm gon' do it for me 'cause I'm tryna get rich
I ain't gon' put on no Tommy
If I don't got Tommy to put on my bitch
I'm doin' my thing now, bitch, I can sing now
So don't expect all my flows not to switch
Step in this bitch, let these hoes feel my drip
If you ain't smokin' on some, I'ma dip (Skrrt)

Leave me alone, just leave me alone
I'm growin' so tired of this (What)
How do you fight the feelin'?
How do you fight the feelin', bitch? (Bitch)
She callin' my phone, she callin' my phone
I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone, girl

[Outro]
When you are on your own
Just know that I love you
I won't pick up the phone
Just know that I need you127Embed ghost boy ghost boy Lil Peep emo
