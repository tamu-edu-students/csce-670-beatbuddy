29 ContributorsOne Last Breath Lyrics[Verse 1]
Please come now, I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say
Let me say

[Chorus]
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

[Verse 2]
I'm looking down, now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out, "Heaven save me"
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say
Let me say

[Chorus]
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
I'm so far down

Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe
There's something left for me
So please come stay with me
'Cause I still believe
There's something left for you and me
For you and me
For you and me

[Refrain]
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking

[Chorus]
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

[Outro]
Please come now, I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe12Embed One Last Breath Weathered Creed grunge
