23 ContributorsARTIFICIAL SUICIDE Lyrics[Verse 1]
Soaked in the neon glows
Silver-forked tongues talking to you in the digital snow
A glitch in the chain, a loop in the brain you wanted to break
But you still wanna play the game

[Chorus]
Well, we're not gonna be a commodity
Not another maggot in the feed that you're gonna eat
Motherfucker, you can try
Artificial suicide

[Verse 2]
Eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Lightin' molotovs for the broken youth (Youth)
Can you hear me through the white noise, friend?
A cheers to the life you don't get to choose
Another Antichrist on the evening news
Can you hear me through the white noise?
Can you hear me through the white noi—

[Chorus]
We're not gonna be a commodity
Not another maggot in the feed that you're gonna eat
Motherfucker, you can try
Artificial suicide
We're not gonna be a commodity
Not another maggot in the feed that you're gonna eat
Motherfucker, you can try
Artificial suicide

You hate the shape when you have to see
An unfamiliar face on an all-black screen
Can you hear me through the white noise, friend?
Repeat the phrase they force you to read
"If I wanna be great, I don't wanna be me"
Can you hear me through the white noise?
Can you hear me through the white noise?

[Breakdown]
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me through the white noise?

[Chorus]
We're not gonna be a commodity
Not another maggot in the feed that you're gonna eat
Motherfucker, you can try
Artificial suicide
We're not gonna be a commodity
Not another maggot in the feed that you're gonna eat
Motherfucker, you can try
Artificial suicide

[Outro]
Can you hear me through the white noi—7Embed
