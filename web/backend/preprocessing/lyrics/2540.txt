16 ContributorsSomeday Lyrics[Verse 1]
How the hell'd we wind up like this?
Why weren't we able, to see the signs that we missed
And try to turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists, and unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing's wrong
Just as long
As you know that someday I will

[Chorus]
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when

[Verse 2]
Well I'd hope that since we're here anyway
That we could end up saying
Things we've always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong
Just as long
As you know that someday I will

[Chorus]
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
You're the only one who knows that

I know you're wondering when

I know you're wondering when12Embed
