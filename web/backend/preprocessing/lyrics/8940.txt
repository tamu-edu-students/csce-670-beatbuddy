4 ContributorsBetter Lyrics[Verse]
Are you fulfilled?
Remember you said
As you took me dreamin'
In your head
'Cause these are the days I laugh at myself
You got me standin' when I needed help
Gone are the days my subconscious would die
It's there in the red of my eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause that's what I love about you
You keep me together
I used to be shy around you
'Cause you made me better
And that's what I love about you
You keep me together
I used to be shy around you
'Cause you made me better, better, better, better

[Drop]
And that's what I love
Love

Love
That's what I love
That's what I love
