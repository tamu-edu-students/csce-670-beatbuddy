What else should I be?
All apologies
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
What else could I write?
I don't have the right
What else should I be?
All apologies

[Chorus]
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun

[Post-Chorus]
Married
Buried

[Verse 2]
I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything's my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua sea foam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn
Chokin' on the ashes of her enemy
You might also like[Chorus]
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun

[Post-Chorus]
Married
Married
Married
Buried
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
