[Verse 1: Everlast]
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk, ya better back up
Try and play the role and yo, the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up, (C'mon!) c'mon, throw your hands up
If ya got the feelin', jump up towards the ceilin'
Muggs let the funk flow, someone's talkin' junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk, and
I got more rhymes than there's cops at a Dunkin'
Donuts shop, sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops

[Pre-Chorus: Everlast]
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around

[Chorus: Everlast]
Jump around (Jump around)
Jump around (Jump around)
Jump around (Jump around)
Jump up, jump up, and get down

[Verse 2: Everlast]
I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smackin' the ho *Smack*
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son, I've returned
Anyone steppin' to me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If ya come to battle, bring a shotgun (Shotgun)
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skill, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill

[Pre-Chorus: Everlast]
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around

[Chorus: Everlast]
Jump around (Jump around)
Jump around (Jump around)
Jump around (Jump around)
Jump up, jump up, and get down
[Post-Chorus: All]
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

Steady on the right
Steady on the left

[Verse 3: Everlast]
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Tryin' to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't goin' out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo, and I might switch
It up, up and around, then buck, buck ya down
Put out ya head and then ya wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm comin' to get ya, I'm comin' to get ya
Spittin' out lyrics, homie, I'll wet ya
[Pre-Chorus: Everlast]
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around

[Chorus: Everlast]
Jump around (Jump around)
Jump around (Jump around)
Jump around (Jump around)
Jump up, jump up, and get down

[Post-Chorus: All]
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

[Outro: Everlast]
Yo, this is dedicated to Joe "The Biter" Nicolo
Grab the bozack, punk
