You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you

[Pre-Chorus]
(Help me) I broke apart my insides
(Help me) I've got no soul to sell
(Help me) The only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself

[Chorus]
I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God

[Verse 2]
You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything

[Pre-Chorus]
(Help me) You tear down my reason
(Help me) It's your sex I can smell
(Help me) You make me perfect
Help me become somebody else

I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God

[Outro]
Through every forest
Above the trees
Within my stomach
Scraped off my knees
I drink the honey
Inside your hive
You are the reason
I stay alive61Embed
