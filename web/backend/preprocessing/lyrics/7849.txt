If you want to hang out
You've got to take her out
Cocaine
If you want to get down
Down on the ground
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

[Verse 2]
If you got bad news
You want to kick them blues
Cocaine
When your day is done
Want to run
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

[Verse 3]
If your thing is gone
And you wanna ride on
Cocaine
Don't forget this fact
You can't get it back
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
