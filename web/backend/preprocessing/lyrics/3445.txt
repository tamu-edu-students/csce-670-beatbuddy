Mmm

[Verse 1]
Sweet and sour motivation
Wish I could keep concentration

[Chorus]
I've been getting high
It's keeping me low now
I'm doing it alone now
I think I gotta slow down
And I know I
I gotta take control now
But I sold my soul a long time ago
I feel like a ghost now

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Oh

[Refrain]
Cherry flavoured conversations with you
Got me hanging on
Down to Earth from all the waiting
Take me somewhere beyond
You might also like[Verse 2]
I've been getting high
But I don't ever stay up, nah, nah
I feel like I'm fading, yeah
Give me stimulation now
Get me to the next level
Come on, give me levitation, God
Slow dancin' with the devil
Sent my soul on a lil' vacation, yeah

[Chorus]
I've been getting high
It's keeping me low now
I'm doing it alone now
I think I gotta slow down
I know I
I gotta take control now
But I sold my soul a long time ago
I feel like a ghost now

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Oh

[Refrain]
Cherry flavoured conversations
[Outro]
Lover boy
Body toy
Cold, cold
Body toy
Cold, cold
I tried to drown
All the pills, I wish they'd
Lover boy
