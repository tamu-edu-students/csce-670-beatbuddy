I summoned you, please come to me
Don't bury thoughts that you really want
I fill you up, drink from my cup
Within me lies what you really want

[Pre-Chorus]
Come, lay me down
'Cause you know this
'Cause you know this sound

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name
I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake
I crave your taste all night long
'Til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh no, ooh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh

These burning flames, these crashing waves
Wash over me like a hurricane
I captivate, you're hypnotized
Feel powerful, but it's me again

[Pre-Chorus]
Come, lay me down
'Cause I know this
'Cause I know this sound

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name
I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake
I crave your taste all night long
'Til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh no, ooh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh
[Bridge]
Just call on me, ah
Just call my name
Like you mean it, ah

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name
I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake
I crave your taste all night long
'Til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh13Embed MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT Elley Duhé pop
