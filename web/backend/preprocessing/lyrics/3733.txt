14 ContributorsTo Love Somebody Lyrics[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you
There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got you? Hey babe

[Chorus]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
In my brain
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so so sorrily blind
I'm a man, can't you see
What I am
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got? Hey babe
You might also like[Chorus]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

Oooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Chorus: Barry Gibb & Robin Gibb]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
(Noo noo no-no nooo nooooo)

[Outro]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you12Embed To Love Somebody Bee Gees' 1st Bee Gees disco
