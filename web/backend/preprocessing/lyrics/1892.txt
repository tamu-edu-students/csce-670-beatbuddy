Red, red wine
Goes to my head
Makes me forget that I
Still need her so
Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
Memories won't go
Memories won't go

[Verse 1: Ali Campbell]
I'd have sworn, that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

[Hook 2: Ali Campbell]
Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be in love
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart

[Verse 2: Ali Campbell]
I'd have sworn, that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
You keep me rockin' all of the time
Red red wine, you make me feel so grand
I feel a million dollar when you're just in my hand

Red red wine, you make me feel so sad
Any time I see you go, it make me feel bad
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey pack him Rizla pon the sweet Dep line

Red red wine, you give me whole heap of zing
Whole heap of zing, you make me do my own thing

Red red wine, you really know how fi love
Your kind of lovin' like a blessing from above

Right from the start with all of my heart
Red red wine in an eighties style
Red red wine in a modern beat style, yeah

Love you 'till I die, and that's no lie
(Don't let me be in love)
Red red wine, can't get you off my mind
Wherever you may be, I'll surely find
