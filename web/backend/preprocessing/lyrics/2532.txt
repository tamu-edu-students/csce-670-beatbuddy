38 Contributors7 Days Lyrics[Intro]
You know what?
Got something to say
Craig David
Seven days
Check it out, yeah

[Verse 1]
On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (Oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

[Pre-Chorus]
Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd, "Love to rendezvous"
She asked me, "What we were gonna do?"
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

[Verse 2]
Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it
(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I, oh-oh, I, yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Ooh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a man to play around, baby (Ooh, yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat 'for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing off my phone
When you're feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me, call me
[Chorus]
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

[Bridge]
(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh, yeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
With you, oh

[Chorus]
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
(Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday)27Embed
