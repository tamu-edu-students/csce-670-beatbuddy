You don't have to be so cautious if you practice what you preach
Counting up the stacks on the counter, a fucking disease
Don't ask me to be righteous if you practice what you teach
Counting all your blessings the second you're down on your knees

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So why, why
Don't we get a little high, high?

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Don't we get a little, get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high, high

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
Keep my head under the water, pride buried in my chest
Not counting all the minutes, the seconds, not holdin' my breath
Now sinking from the surface, swimming in my lungs
Losing all my vision, religion, I'm holding my tongue

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So why, why
Don't we get a little high, high?

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Don't we get a little, get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high, high

Don't wanna pay attention to the writing on the wall
Painted with aggression, and dripping when you call
Not gonna learn my lesson, am I running out of time?
So, why, why, why?

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Don't we get a little, get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high, high13Embed
