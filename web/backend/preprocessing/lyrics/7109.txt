You lay here with me, you're shuttin' down
I smell her on ya, I'm focused now
I know what's goin' on in your head, yeah
I know what's happened here in our bed, yeah
Your phone is buzzin', so pick it up
I know she callin', so what the fuck?
I should've known a cheat stays a cheater
So here we are

[Chorus]
And there goes the alarm ringin' in my head
Like somebody said, "Don't you trust him, no"
Text in from his ex, what did you expect?
Now you're lyin' here knowin' where he goes
Now he got that itch, yeah, karma is a bitch, yeah
Same way that they come, that's the way they go
Now he got that itch, yeah, rewindin' the picture
There goes the alarm and the sirens go
There goes the alarm

[Verse 2]
I saw it comin', I let it go
My girls will tell me, "I told you so"
But I was so intrigued by your style, boy
Always been a sucker for a wild boy
I'm better than this, I know my worth
I might be gettin' what I deserve
But I ain't stickin' 'round for the re-run
What's done is done

[Bridge]
Bang bang, two-shots fired
Man down, one fool, one liar
Ring ring, trust gone missin'
