God money, I'll do anything for you
God money, just tell me what you want me to
God money, nail me up against the wall
God money, don't want everything, he wants it all

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you can't take it, no, you can't take it
No, you can't take that away from me
No, you can't take it, no, you can't take it
No, you can't take that away from me

[Chorus]
Head like a hole, black as your soul
I'd rather die than give you control
Head like a hole, black as your soul
I'd rather die than give you control

[Post-Chorus]
Bow down before the one you serve
You're going to get what you deserve
Bow down before the one you serve
You're going to get what you deserve

[Verse 2]
God money's not looking for the cure
God money's not concerned about the sick among the pure
God money, let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised
God money's not one to choose

No, you can't take it, no, you can't take it
No, you can't take that away from me
No, you can't take it, no, you can't take it
No, you can't take that away from me

[Chorus]
Head like a hole, black as your soul
I'd rather die than give you control
Head like a hole, black as your soul
I'd rather die than give you control

[Post-Chorus]
Bow down before the one you serve
You're going to get what you deserve
Bow down before the one you serve
You're going to get what you deserve
