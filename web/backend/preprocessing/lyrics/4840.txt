And I said what's up? What you been thinking?
'Cause you've been staring at that roof so long, I swear it's come alive
And she spoke nine words and now we're sinking
But I can't find it in myself to want to lie to keep this thing from going down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that girl took my heart
And I ain't want it back
No
I'm laying down my cards

[Verse 2]
'Cause you said it meant nothing
And I should've kept my silence
But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know
That all these words meant nothing
And I've always been this heartless
But we're just having sex, no, I would never call it love
But love

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Woah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, and, so I guess it's
Woah, hey, yeah, yeah
Woah, let die to let live

[Verse 3]
And what's good
When both choices I've got
Have us staring down the barrel to the bullets I can't stop?
And so I stand off like indecision's Kevlar
'Til this fear of feeling stops and I'm done
But you

[Bridge]
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you

[Pre-Chorus]
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
'Cause that girl took my heart
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
And I ain't want it back, no
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
A bulletproof restart
[Chorus]
Oh, no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, and, so I guess it's
Woah, hey, yeah, yeah
Woah, let die to let live

[Outro]
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you40Embed sex i think you think too much of me EDEN indie-pop
