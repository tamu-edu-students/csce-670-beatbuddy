Anyway

[Verse 1]
It's bad bitch o'clock, yeah, it's thick-thirty
I've been through a lot, but I'm still flirty (Okay)
Is everybody back up in the buildin'?
It's been a minute, tell me how you're healin'
'Cause I'm about to get into my feelings
How you feelin'? How you feel right now?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I been so down and under pressure
I'm way too fine to be this stressed, yeah
Oh, I'm not the girl I was or used to be, uh
Bitch, I might be better

Turn up the music, turn down the lights
I got a feelin' I'm gon' be alright

Wanna get up, wanna get down
