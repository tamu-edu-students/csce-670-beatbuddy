That's the state of my, state of my
State of my head
That's the state of my, state of my
State of my head

[Verse 1]
It's been a long, bumpy ride
Sitting back in the saddle
It's time to get down, dirty up
Our knees in the battle
Come on, round up the boys
Gonna make the walls rattle
Oh, our flag is tattered
And our bones are shattered
But it doesn't matter
'Cause we're moving forward

[Pre-Chorus]
Round 'em up, round 'em up, let's go
Round 'em up, let's go

[Chorus]
Oh, my eyes are seeing red
Double vision from the blood we've shed
The only way I'm leaving is dead

We got that concrete-street skin
The only way I'm leaving is dead
That's the state of my, state of my
State of my head

From the bottom of the barrel (Barrel)
Oh, our flag is tattered
And our bones are shattered
But it doesn't matter
'Cause we're moving forward

Round 'em up, round 'em up, let's go
Round 'em up, let's go

[Chorus]
Oh, my eyes are seeing red
Double vision from the blood we've shed
The only way I'm leaving is dead
That's the state of my, state of my
State of my head
They don't know where we've been
We got that concrete-street skin
The only way I'm leaving is dead
That's the state of my, state of my
State of my head
[Post-Chorus]
That's the state of my, state of my
State of my head
That's the state of my, state of my
State of my head

[Bridge]
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
I'm coming back for more
Do you feel me now? Do you feel me now?
I'm breaking down your door
I'm not speaking under my breath
'Cause the harder you push, the rougher I get
'Cause I'm not shaking, when the earth starts quaking
Got my own foundation with no hesitation and the
