16 ContributorsHard Skool Lyrics[Verse 1]
All cautions made, every chance was given
No effort spared to save what we had
All in good faith I would not hesitate
To extend myself and lend you my hand

[Chorus]
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway

[Verse 2]
As tempers fade and lies forgiven
No cause embraced could break what we had
In its place a storm is liftin'
I would've thought you could be more of a man

[Chorus]
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway

Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy

[Chorus]
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
Had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
Had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anywayEmbed
