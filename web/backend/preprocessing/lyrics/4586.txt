21 ContributorsBad Girlfriend Lyrics[Verse 1]
My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend gotta have it
She's hot, can't stop, up on stage, doing shots
Tip the man, he'll ring the bell
Get her drunk, she'll scream like hell
Dirty girl, gettin' down, dance with guys from outta town
Grab her ass, actin' tough, mess with her, she'll fuck you up

No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight

[Chorus]
She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend

[Verse 2]
Red thong, party's on, love this song, sing along
Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home

No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight
I say, no one really knows just how far she's gonna go
But I'm gonna find out later tonight

She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it

[Bridge]
Doesn't take her long to make things right
But does it make her wrong to have the time of her life?
The time of her life

My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend gotta have it

She's a gold digger, now you figure out it's over, pull the trigger
Futures finished, there it went, savings gone, the money spent
Look around and all I see, no good, bad, and ugly
Man she's hot and fixed to be the future ex-Miss Connolly

[Chorus]
She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend
[Outro]
She's a bad, bad girlfriend
She's a bad, bad girlfriend9Embed Bad Girlfriend Scars & Souvenirs (Special Edition) Theory of a Deadman grunge
