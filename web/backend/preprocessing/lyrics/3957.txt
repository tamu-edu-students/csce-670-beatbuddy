47 ContributorsBetter Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Waitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o'clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech
As he opens the door, she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over

[Chorus]
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man
Oh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Talkin' to herself, "There's no one else who needs to know," she tells herself
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew him, now she swears he's gone

[Chorus]
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man

She loved him, yeah
She don't want to leave this way
She feeds him, yeah
That's why she'll be back again

[Outro]
Can't find a better man (Can't find a better man)
Can't find a better man (Can't find a better man)
Can't find a better man (Can't find a better man)
Can't find a better
