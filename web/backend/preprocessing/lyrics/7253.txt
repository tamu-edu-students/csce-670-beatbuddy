Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Just say you want me, that's all it takes
Heart's gettin' torn from your mistakes

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love, if you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might
Baby, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floatin' away

[Verse 2]
Just say you love me, just for today
And don't give me time 'cause that's not the same
I want to feel burning flames when you say my name
I want to feel passion flow into my bones like blood through my veins

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love if you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might
Baby, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floatin' away

[Bridge]
Won't you stay? Won't you stay?
Slowly, slowly you unfold me
But do you know me at all?
Someone told me love controls everything
But only if you know

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
(No-no-no-no, no, no)
If you don't wanna try
(Just try sometimes)
But all that I've been thinking of
(I just think)
Is maybe that you might
(You might)

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love, if you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might
And baby, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floatin' away

[Outro]
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay40Embed
