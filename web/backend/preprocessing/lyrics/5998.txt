2 Contributors​you won’t be there for me Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's hard to understand me
But I keep my own boundaries
Why won't they do the same?
I'm tired of being the nice guy
I know I shouldn't be
The one complaining right now
I'm the one who did this to myself

[Chorus]
I hope you know that I'm going crazy
I honestly don't know how much I can take
Will you be there for me?
When I'm feeling down
With the way that you're treating me
I honestly don't know
I hope you know that I'm going crazy
I honestly don't know how much I can take
You won't be there for me

[Verse 2]
That much I know
I learned that the hard way
Hard way to say goodbye
Hope you know
I held it in
As much as I could do
I won't hold back thеse tears tonight
All alone to mysеlf

I hope you know that I'm going crazy
I honestly don't know how much I can take
Will you be there for me?
When I'm feeling down
With the way that you're treating me
I honestly don't know
I hope you know that I'm going crazy
I honestly don't know how much I can take
You won't be there for me

[Bridge]
I know too well
No worries I'll be gone before you know it

[Outro]
Know it
Know
Know it
I hope you know that I'm crazyEmbed
