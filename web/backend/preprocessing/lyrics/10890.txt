5 ContributorsPetals Lyrics[Verse 1]
To see age in a flower
The dawns are speeding up
You know it'll hurt you
Feel all of a sudden
Tired and teary-eyed
You knew it'd kill you

[Verse 2]
Don't wear a tie that'll choke you
To death in the city
Take it off and forget
Spare the fret that'll make you
Miss all of Summer
Sweat it out and forgive

[Verse 3]
To see loss in a shower
The petals turn to mush
It still disappoints you
Then less of a sudden
You wire your weary mind
To let it deceive you

[Verse 4]
Don't force a smile that'll make you
Resent the city
Play it soft and forgive
Keep the frown that'll make you
Squint in the Summer
Play it slow and forgetYou might also likeEmbed
