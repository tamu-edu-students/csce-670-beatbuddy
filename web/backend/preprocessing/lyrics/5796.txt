35 ContributorsPain Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't feel the way I've ever felt
I know
Gonna smile and not get worried
I try but it shows

[Pre-Chorus]
Anyone can make what I have built and better now
Anyone can find the same white pills
It takes my pain away

[Chorus]
It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind, these are hurried times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd walk away from you
I did
But it's a false sense of accomplishment every time I quit

[Pre-Chorus]
Anyone can see my every flaw
It isn't hard
Anyone can say they're above this all
It takes my pain away
You might also like[Chorus]
It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind these are hurried times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me

I can't let it bother me
It takes my pain away

[Chorus]
It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind, these are hurried times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me

[Outro]
Takes my pain
Takes my pain
Takes my pain
Takes my pain away3Embed
