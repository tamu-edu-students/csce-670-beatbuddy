High off life, yeah

[Chorus]
Seem like the life I fiend
Seem like the life I fiend's a little distant, yeah
Seems like the life I need, yeah
Seems like the life I need's a little distant, yeah

[Verse]
Light the remedy, yeah
Sit back while I ride the deep, do it on repeat, repeat
Sins controlling me, yeah
Angels, halos over me, I need blessings and my peace
You been out the streets, yeah
Wildin' on me and all my G's, we been going for a week
Now you wanna peek, yeah
Hands up, why they tryna reach? I can't even get that deep
Told you, I don't teach (Yeah)
Practice, oh, no, never preach
Practice, oh, no, never preach
Infiltrate the enemy, moving on them randomly

[Chorus]
Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
Yeah
Feels like the life I need, yeah
Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeahYou might also like109Embed ASTROTHUNDER ASTROWORLD Travis Scott house
