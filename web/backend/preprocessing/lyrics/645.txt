Passin' every red light
I know I'm in over my head
A rebel and I don't hide
Remember all the words that you said

[Pre-Chorus: A7S]
Even if the love was hurtin'
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burnin'
Give me more

[Chorus: A7S]
So tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So tell me, would you feel my love?
Yeah, I could never leave, 'cause I need it, that feeling
Let me feel your love
Let me feel your love

[Verse 2: A7S]
You can make me let go
Forget about the world for a while
You had me at "Hello"
I'm drownin' in the blue of your eyes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: A7S]

[Chorus: A7S]
So tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So tell me, would you feel my love?
Yeah, I could never leave, 'cause I need it, that feeling
Let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
So tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So tell me, would you feel my love?
