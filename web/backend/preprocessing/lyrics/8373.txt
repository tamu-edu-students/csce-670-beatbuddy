2 ContributorsTuff Noodles Lyrics[Intro]
Nah, It-it don't gotta be perfect
It's just gotta be flawless
Y'know what I'm saying
Kevmo kill 'em all

[Hook]
Mean mug, cause I'm tough
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I'm a mutt
God bless, this ain't luck
And them 2-3's on my feet cause I'm clutch
I need a new crib for my mama, that's a must
I need to blow up like Osama, that's a must
I hear my haters wanna play me, well good luck
You wanna see if we about it then pull up

[Verse 1]
Kevmo on the kicks
That's no-look assist
Work it with my wrist
Work it till it rock up
I got records, I got hits
Whippin' it out the dish
Wrapping it up like gifts
Flow as tough as nails
Goin' hard, they could tell
I be with my dogs, so I can not tuck my tail
Riot at my show
The cops might take me straight to jail
[?] said don't worry cause
Big Cuzzo got my belt
Not a fan of 'em
When these rappers wanna stunt
Wash my hands off 'em
When they get to actin' tough
Count my bands on 'em
AC-DC in the trunk
Somewhere in the cut
I be somewhere posted up like

I need to blow up like Osama, that's a must
I hear my haters wanna play me, well good luck
You wanna see if we about it then pull up

[Verse 2]
Someone tell me how they want it
Pick your poison
They can't stop me cause I'm God blessed
I'm anointed
Who that girl that he pulled up with
Yeah, she gorgeous
That's my baby, had to cuff her
Get the lawyers
Stop talking when I'm talking
I got something for ya
If I feel you not official
Then I just ignore ya
All these rappers white-washing
Feel like Tom Sawyer
Had to give 'em something different
Cause the fans bored of ya
Hood scholar
I'ma whip up [?]
Yea they thought that they could play me
I am no accordian
Swear these rappers be my sons
I'ma have to Maury ya
King like Lebron James
But I'm still a Warrior
