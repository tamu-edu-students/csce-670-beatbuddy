I was pulling out my hair the day I got the deal
Chemically calm
Was I meant to feel happy that my life
Was just about to change?
One life pretending to be
The cat who got the cream
Oh, everybody said, "Marina is a dreamer"
People like to tell you

[Pre-Chorus]
What you're gonna be
It's not my problem if you don't see what I see
And I do not give a damn if you don't believe
My problem, it's my problem that I never am happy
It's my problem, it's my problem on how fast I will succeed

[Chorus]
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?

[Verse 2]
High achiever, don't you see?
Baby, nothing comes for free
They say I'm a control freak
Driven by a greed to succeed
Nobody can stop me

'Cause it's my problem if I wanna pack up and run away
It's my business if I feel the need to smoke and drink and sway
It's my problem, it's my problem if I feel the need to hide
And it's my problem if I have no friends and feel I want to die

[Chorus]
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Once you cross the line, will you be satisfied?

[Bridge]
Sad inside, in this life
Unsatisfied, praying
Sad inside, in this life
Unsatisfied, waiting

[Chorus]
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Once you cross the line, will you be satisfied?

[Outro]

Black, white
(Are you satisfied, are you satisfied?)
