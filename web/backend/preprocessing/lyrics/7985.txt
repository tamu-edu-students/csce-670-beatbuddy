Baby, I'm a firefighter trapped in a burning house in a silent picture
And there is no way out except to watch the love between us die

[Verse 2]
That's called the Falling Angel
It's an amusement park ride
Some sort of rollercoaster
It takes you up and when it brings you down
It gives you butterflies

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And now I'm longing for your kiss
Bet you could read it on my lips
Ohh
Waterfalls, I'm jumping down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I know you're leaving, baby
The birds are flying south
And there's nothing to say
I need you here
I need your love inside of mine like I could die
I need your love inside of mine like I could dieSee Cigarettes After Sex LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like8Embed
