I'm only eighteen and I feel like I'm dying
I'm getting sad too soon
I hope I make it, 'cause I'm trying
I've loved and I've lost
And realized that it's all my fault
Wish someone loved me enough
To catch me when I fall, hmm

[Verse 1]
And I know it's kinda selfish, but
It's not my choice to leave
'Cause I wish I could stay
But it's more of a need
For me to go away
I'm tired of the world hating on me
I wake up to the friends that I can't keep
And when the end is near and I'm asleep
I'll be chasing dreams while counting sheep

[Bridge]
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
When I turn nineteen, I'ma feel like I'm flying
I'm in the sky where, where I'm free and I'm smiling
But 'till then
Things will stay the same
Things will never change
Life will be a mess
And that life I became hopelessly in love
With doing what my brain tells me to do
And life, I'm over youYou might also like1Embed
