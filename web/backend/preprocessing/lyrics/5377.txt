No, I'm not color blind
I know the world is black and white
I try to keep an open mind
But, I just can't sleep on this tonight

[Chorus]
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?

[Verse 2]
Don't know how else to say it
Don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own

[Chorus]
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?

[Verse 3]
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun

[Bridge 1]
Had a talk with my old man
Said, "Help me understand"
He said, "Turn 68, you'll renegotiate"

[Chorus]
"Don't stop this train
Don't, for a minute, change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly, we'll never stop this train"

[Bridge 2]
Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And they're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're driving away in the dark
[Chorus]
Singing, "Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
'Cause, now, I see, I'll never stop this train"27Embed Stop This Train Continuum John Mayer singer-songwriter
