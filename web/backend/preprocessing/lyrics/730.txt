Send "Lost In Your Complexity" Ringtone to Mobile I'd give you the soul of this boy that is in front of you
His useless life isn't enough to beseech all your love
As you put sight in this poor boy that is ready with fear
To flourish through darkness and enter your complexity

Aching as flowers refused
Then you loose grip on emotions;
With sadness we're doomed
The frost is inside you killing you through
Burning your heart in the name of truth

In fear, we sear
Again in tears
Recall the years when fights appeared
Remember dear, those lonely years
You turn, with fear, to not see me crying here

Why? Why does your sun shine this way?
Say no more, cast me to die just today

Fighting within
Our quest tastes like an open wound
Now that's all over; this quest will never come through
You might also likeI can't wait for any answers
I'm so lost to go any further

Man might never know for sure
The complex equations of love and truth
(So) face the abnormal strength within you
Just when you loose the chance to choose
