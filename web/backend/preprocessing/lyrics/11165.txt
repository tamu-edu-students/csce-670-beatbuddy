20 ContributorsWhat Else Is There? LyricsIt was me on that road
But you couldn't see me
Too many lights out, but nowhere near here
It was me on that road
Still you couldn't see me
And then flash lights and explosions
Road's end getting nearer
We cover distance, but not together
I am the storm and I am the wonder
And the flashlights, nightmares
And sudden explosions

[Hook]
I don't know what more to ask for
I was given just one wish

It's about you and the sun
A morning run
The story of my maker
What I have and what I ache for
I've got a golden ear
I cut and I spear
But what else is there?
Roads and getting nearer
We cover distance, still not together
You might also likeIf I am the storm, if I am the wonder
Will I have flashlights, nightmares
And sudden explosion?
There's no room where I can go and
You've got secrets too

[Hook]
I don't know what more to ask for
I was given just one wish8Embed What Else Is There? The Understanding Röyksopp trip-hop
