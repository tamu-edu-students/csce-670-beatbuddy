What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

[Verse 1]
Are you waiting on a lightning strike?
Are you waiting for the perfect night?
Are you waiting till the time is right?
What are you waiting for?
Don't you wanna learn to deal with fear?
Don't you wanna take the wheel and steer?
Don't you wait another minute here
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you've got
You're only livin' once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you've got to give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You're only livin' once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the right excuse?
Are you waiting for a sign to choose?
While you're waiting, it's the time you lose
What are you waiting for? (What are you waiting for?)
Don't you want to spread your wings and fly?
Don't you really wanna live your life?
Don't you wanna love before you die?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

[Bridge]
Everybody's gonna make mistakes
But everybody's got a choice to make
Everybody needs a leap of faith
When are you taking yours?
What are you waiting for?
[Chorus]
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you've got
You're only livin' once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you've got to give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You're only livin' once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
What are you waiting for?
Believe in every dream that you've got
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you've got to give it your all
What are you waiting for?
You're only livin' once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
