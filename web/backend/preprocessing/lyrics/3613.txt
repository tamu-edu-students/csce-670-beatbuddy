[Verse 1]
Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high

[Refrain]
He
Is
The Painkiller
This
Is
The Painkiller

[Verse 2]
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels

[Bridge]
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium-plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
[Lead: Glenn]

[Verse 3]
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
