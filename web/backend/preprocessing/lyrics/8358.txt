I'm like a child lookin' off in the horizon
I'm like an ambulance that's turnin' on the sirens
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive
I'm like a soldier comin' home for the first time
I dodged a bullet, and I walked across a landmine
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I bleedin'?
Am I bleedin' from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm still breathin'
'Cause I'm still breathin' on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Makin' my way away
'Cause I'm still breathin'
'Cause I'm still breathin' on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Makin' my way away, my way to you

[Verse 2]
I'm like a junkie tyin' off for the last time
I'm like a loser that's bettin' on his last dime
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive
I'm like a son that was raised without a father
I'm like a mother barely keepin' it together
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive

Am I bleedin'?
Am I bleedin' from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm still breathin'
'Cause I'm still breathin' on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Makin' my way away
'Cause I'm still breathin'
'Cause I'm still breathin' on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Makin' my way away, away

[Bridge]
As I walked out on the ledge
Are you scared to death to live?
And I've been runnin' all my life
Just to find a home that's for the restless
And the truth that's in the message
Makin' my way away, away

[Interlude]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm still breathin'
'Cause I'm still breathin' on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Makin' my way away
'Cause I'm still breathin'
'Cause I'm still breathin' on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Makin' my way away
(My way to you) 'Cause I'm still breathin'
(My way to you) 'Cause I'm still breathin' on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Makin' my way away, my way to you17Embed Still Breathing Revolution Radio Green Day punk
