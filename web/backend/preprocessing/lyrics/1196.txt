Can't be sleeping, keep on waking
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning, inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

[Chorus] (x2)
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

[Drop]
Don't blame it on me!

[Verse 2]
Can't you see it? I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
I had no choice in this, I was the friend she missed
She needed me to talk

[Chorus] (x2) + [Drop]

[Bridge]
Oh I'm so sorry, so sorry baby
(I'll be better this time)
I will be better this time
I got to say
I'm so sorry
Oh I promise
(I'll be better this time, I'll be better this time)
