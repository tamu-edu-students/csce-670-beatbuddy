Who's to know if your soul will fade at all?
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self esteem along the way, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Good God, you're coming up with reasons
Good God, you're dragging it out
And good God, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped, so follow me down and just

[Chorus]
Fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa, you're such a fucking hypocrite

[Verse 2]
You should know that the lies won't hide your flaws
No sense in hiding all of yours
You gave up on your dreams along the way, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Good God, you're coming up with reasons
Good God, you're dragging it out
And good God, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped, so follow me down and just
