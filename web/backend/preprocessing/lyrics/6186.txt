Ooh
Oh, baby now let's get down tonight
Oh, baby now let's get down tonight
Baby
Oh, baby now let's get down tonight
Ooh
Baby, I'm hot just like an oven
Ooh
Oh, baby now let's get down tonight

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

[Chorus 1]
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Baby, I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer

[Verse 2]
Baby, I got sick this mornin'
A sea was stormin' inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizin'
The waves are risin' and risin'

[Chorus 2]
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
