27 ContributorsRoll Over Beethoven Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well I'mma write a little letter
I'm gonna mail it to my local DJ
Yeah, it's a jumpin' little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
I gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2]
You know my temperature's risin'
The jukebox blowin' a fuse
My heart's beatin' rhythm
And my soul keep a-singin' the blues
Roll over Beethoven
Tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3]
I got the rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I caught the rollin' arthritis
Sittin' down at a rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
They rockin' in two by two

[Bridge]
Well, if you feel and like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over then move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock with
One another
Roll over Beethoven
Dig these rhythm and blues

[Verse 4]
Well, early in the mornin', and I'm givin' you my warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle diddle, I'ma play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 5]
You know she wiggle like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
You oughta see him reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music won't never stop

[Outro]
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues3Embed Roll Over Beethoven Berry Is On Top Chuck Berry rockabilly
