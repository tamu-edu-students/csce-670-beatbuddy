I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart

And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Oh, need a love, now)
(My heart is thinking of)

[Bridge]
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
