11 ContributorsBullet With a Name Lyrics[Intro: Elias Soriano & Andrew Goldman]
Oh, my disposition is in a position for all to see
Regretless for how it feels
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
Whoa, 'cause the cause for all the pause you think you see
Is really concentration on the steel
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name

[Verse 1: Elias Soriano]
You see, everybody's watchin' and passin' judgment on
Every little move and decision I make
How can I be an individual
With the weight of the world
And eight other planets to take?
And with everything happenin'?
Gunshots clappin' and
People all runnin' in every direction
With their hands up prayin' for the drama to end
I got my hand out lookin' for some money to spend

[Chorus: Elias Soriano & Andrew Goldman]
The price tag on the things I need
Are getting bigger by the day
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
Whoa, the way I work so hard for things
They just take away from me
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name

With a name
Let me show you how I'm workin'

[Verse 2: Elias Soriano]
Oh, I'm workin' harder than a hundred black mules down in Mexico
No water, no cloud
No cover from the hotter than Hell
No dinner bell, empty oven again
From another bad opinion
I mean, who doesn't want
The cars, money, fame, attention
Bars, honeys, games, attention, stars?
Funny how we say we don't need it
Then turn around, and try to achieve it

[Chorus: Elias Soriano & Andrew Goldman]
The price tag on the things I need
Are getting bigger by the day
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
Whoa, the way I work so hard for things
They just take away from me
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
[Bridge: Elias Soriano]
Oh, and everything that they say about me
And everything that they make me need
Are nothing when they're taking everything away from me
And everyone trying to make it harder
And everyone saying I would never be
You're nothing but a name
On the bullet that I aim
On the bullet that I aim
On the bullet that I aim

[Chorus: Elias Soriano & Andrew Goldman]
The price tag on the things I need
Are getting bigger by the day
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
Whoa, the way I work so hard for things
They just take away from me
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name

[Outro: Andrew Goldman & Elias Soriano]
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
I got a bullet with a name on it
