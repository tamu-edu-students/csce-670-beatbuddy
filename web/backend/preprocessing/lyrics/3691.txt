And now, I don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye
But then, it seems that I had seen it in her eyes
Though it might not be wise, I'd still have to try
With all the love I have inside, I can't deny
I just can't let it die, 'cause her heart's just like mine
And she holds her pain inside
So, if you ask me why she wouldn't say goodbye
I know somewhere inside
There is a special light, still shining bright
And even on the darkest night, she can't deny

[Chorus]
So, if she's somewhere near me, I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me, please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

[Verse 2]
No matter how I try, you say it's all a lie
So, what's the use of my confessions to a crime
Of passions that won't die
In my heart?

[Chorus]
So, if she's somewhere near me, I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me, please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

[Chorus]
So, if she's somewhere near me, I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me, please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and find myself within her eyes

[Outro]
So, now I don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye
It just might be that I had seen it in her eyes
And now, it seems that I gave up my ghost of pride
I'll never say goodbye18Embed This I Love Chinese Democracy Guns N' Roses hard-rock
