Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

[Verse 1: Bob Marley]
Preacher man don't tell me heaven is under the earth
I know you don't know what life is really worth
It's not all that glitter is gold and
Half the story has never been told
So now you see the light, aay
Stand up for your right. Come on

[Chorus: The Wailers and Bob Marley]
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

[Verse 2: Bob Marley]
Most people think great God will come from the sky
Take away everything, and make everybody feel high
But if you know what life is worth
You would look for yours on earth
And now you see the light
You stand up for your right, yeah

[Verse 3: Peter Tosh]
We're sick and tired of your ism and schism game
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name, Lord
We know and we understand
Almighty God is a living man
You can fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
So now we see the light
(What you gonna do?)
We going to stand up for our right
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
