Somebody told me I've been on this road too long
So I am sorry if I ever let you down
You know I'm trying to make it all better now
Just believe that things will change

Somebody told me I've been on this road too long
So I am sorry if I ever let you down
You know I'm trying to make it all better now
Just believe I'm making changes

[Verse]
I fell, maybe a million times
I've walked into a thousand fires
But I know, it's gonna be alright
Yeah, it's gonna be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I say, "No" to the non-believers
I say, "No" to being defeated
Won't let go, 'cause I can almost see it
Ooh-oh

[Chorus]
Somebody told me I've been on this road too long
So I am sorry if I ever let you down
You know I'm trying to make it all better now
Just believe I'm making changes
