16 ContributorsWill You Still Love Me Tomorrow? (2011) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tonight, you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight, the light of love is in your eyes
Will you still love me tomorrow?

[Verse 2]
Is this a lasting treasure?
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow? Yeah

[Verse 3]
Tonight, with words unspoken
And you said that I'm the only one, the only one, yeah
But will my heart be broken
When the night (When the night) meets (Meets the morning) the morning star?

[Verse 4]
I'd like to know that your love is love I can be sure of, ooh, yeah
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
(Will you still love me tomorrow?)
Will you still love me tomorrow?

[Outro]
Will you still love me tomorrow? Ooh
Will you still love me tomorrow?
(Will you still love me tomorrow?)
