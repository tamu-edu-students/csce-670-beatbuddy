To your soul
To your soul
Cry
Cry
Cry

[Verse 1]
You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case
Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face

[Verse 2]
Mother will never understand why you had to leave
But the answers you seek will never be found at home
The love that you need will never be found at home

[Chorus]
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Oooh)

[Verse 3]
Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy
You were the one that they'd talk about around town as they put you down

[Verse 4]
And as hard as they would try they'd hurt to make you cry
But you never cried to them, just to your soul
No, you never cried to them, just to your soul
You might also like[Chorus]
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
(Crying to your soul, crying to your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
(Crying to your soul, crying to your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Cry)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

[Bridge]
Cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
(Cry)

[Verse 5]
You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case
Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face

[Chorus]
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Cry)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Cry)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
(To your soul, to your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Cry)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Cry)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (To your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
(To your soul)19Embed
