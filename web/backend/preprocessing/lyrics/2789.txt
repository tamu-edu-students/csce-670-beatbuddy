30 ContributorsBroken (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Shaun Morgan]
I wanted you to know that I love the way you laugh
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph and I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

[Chorus: Shaun Morgan & Amy Lee]
Because I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

[Post-Chorus: Shaun Morgan]
You've gone away
You don't feel me here anymore

[Verse 2: Amy Lee]
The worst is over now and we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away
There's so much left to learn and no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

[Chorus: Shaun Morgan & Amy Lee]
'Cause I’m broken when I’m open
And I don’t feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away
'Cause I’m broken when I’m open
And I don’t feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone
