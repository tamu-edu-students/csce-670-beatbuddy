48 ContributorsDragula Lyrics[Intro]
Superstition, fear, and jealousy

[Verse 1]
Dead I am the one, exterminatin' son
Slippin' through the trees, stranglin' the breeze
Dead I am the sky, watchin' angels cry
While they slowly turn, conquering the worm

[Chorus]
Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
And slam in the back of my Dragula
Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
And slam in the back of my Dragula

[Verse 2]
Dead I am the pool, spreading from the fool
Weak and want you need, nowhere as you bleed
Dead I am the rat, feast upon the cat
Tender is the fur, dying as you purr

[Chorus]
Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
And slam in the back of my Dragula
Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
And slam in the back of my Dragula

Do it baby, do it baby
Do it baby, do it baby
Burn like an animal

[Verse 3]
Dead I am the life, dig into the skin
Knuckle, crack the bone, 21 to win
Dead I am the dog, hound of hell, you cry
Devil on your back, I can never die

[Chorus]
Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
And slam in the back of my Dragula
Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
And slam in the back of my Dragula

[Hook]
Do it baby, do it baby
Do it baby, do it baby
Burn like an animal

[Chorus]
Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
And slam in the back of my Dragula
Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
And slam in the back of my Dragula
[Outro]
Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
And slam in the back of my Dragula28Embed
