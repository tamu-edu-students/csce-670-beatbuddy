29 ContributorsThe Bakery Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish you would have smiled in the bakery
Or sat on a tatty settee
At a mutual friend's gathering
And the more you keep on looking, the more it's hard to take
Love, we're in stalemate
To never meet is surely where we're bound
There's one in every town
Just there to grind you down

[Verse 2]
I wish I would have seen you in the post office
Well, maybe I did and I missed it
Too busy with the mind on clever lines
Why not the rounders pitch or the canteen?
You're slacking, love, where have you been?
Just had to go and wait until tonight

[Bridge]
To give me the invite
Don't worry, it's alright

[Verse 3]
I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
Sipping on a lemonade
In the paper cup and chewing on the straw
And I wish I'd seen you in the bakery
But if I'd seen you in the bakery
You probably wouldn't have seen meYou might also like11Embed
