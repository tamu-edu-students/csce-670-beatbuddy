I see the bad moon arising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today

[Chorus]
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

[Verse 2]
I hear hurricanes a-blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

[Chorus]
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
All right

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

[Chorus]
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise24Embed
