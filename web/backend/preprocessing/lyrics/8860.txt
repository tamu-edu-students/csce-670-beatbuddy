Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brothers live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Cheer up my brothers all by and by

All by and by, all by and by

Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Tempted and tried we're living in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Cheer up my brothers all by and by
Cheer up my brothers all by and by
Cheer up my brothers all by and byYou might also like1Embed
