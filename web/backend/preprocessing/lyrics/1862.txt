79 ContributorsWalk on the Wild Side Lyrics[Verse 1]
Holly came from Miami, F-L-A
Hitchhiked her way across the U.S.A. 
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she

[Chorus]
She says, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side"

[Verse 2]
Candy came from out on the Island
In the backroom, she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was giving head

[Chorus]
She says, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"

[Post-Chorus]
And the colored girls go
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo

Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York City is the place where they said

[Chorus]
"Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side"

[Verse 4]
Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Looking for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should've seen him go, go, go

[Chorus]
They said, "Hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Alright, huh

[Verse 5]
Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would've helped that bash
[Chorus]
She said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side"

[Post-Chorus]
And the colored girls say
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
