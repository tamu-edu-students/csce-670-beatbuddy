4 ContributorsMore Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't wanna get old
Don't wanna die young
I’m buyin’ their cold
Void satisfaction
Our poison each day
My reason to stay
New feelings in store

[Pre-Chorus]
Alright gimme more
Alright gimme more

[Chorus]
We could have been the ones
Who cut the screen at once
We should have seen the ones
Who turned machines at once
We could have been the ones
Who left the scene at once
We could have been the ones
Who took the streets at once

We could have been the ones
Who left the scene at once
You might also like[Verse 2]
Never gets old
My sad addiction
Letters now bold
The saddest fiction
Don’t wanna buy gold
Don’t wanna buy love
‘Cuz now it is all sold
There’s never enough
It’s never enough

[Chorus]
We could have been the ones
Who cut the screen at once
We should have seen the ones
Who turned machines at once
We could have been the ones
Who left the scene at once
We could have been the ones
Who took the streets at onceEmbed
