15 ContributorsStuck On You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

[Verse 2]
I'm stuck on you
Been a fool too long, I guess it's time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way
So hard to see
That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
I've packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
'Cause this time, little darling
I'm coming home to stay

[Verse 3]
I'm stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
I needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way
I'm mighty glad you stayedSee Lionel Richie LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also like3Embed Stuck On You Can't Slow Down Lionel Richie disco
