60 ContributorsLast Nite Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turn me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walkin' out that door
Well, I've been in town for just 'bout fifteen, oh, minutes now
And, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walkin' for miles

[Chorus]
And see people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

[Verse 2]
Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turn me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

[Verse 1]
Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
See, it turn me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walkin' out that door, yeah39Embed
