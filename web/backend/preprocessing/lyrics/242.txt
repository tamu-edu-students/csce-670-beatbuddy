Alright, Mello made it right
Bye-bye, bye-bye
Oh my, get out my life
She said, "Why?"
(Mello made it right)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I hit her with a bye-bye, bye-bye
You're out your mind
I'm out of pills
And you're out of lies
It stays dark outside
Even when it's daytime
Like, bye-bye, bye-bye
Uh, bye-bye, bye-bye

[Verse: Juice WRLD]
Um, see you later, uh
Girl, I got a question for you, yeah, I need a favor (Uh)
Turn yourself back to a demon, I'm a demon slayer (Uh)
Hell-proof to the core, take me to your lair (Uh)
Uh, hella persuasive
Hella curved animation, like The Matrix
Percocet, body achin', stomach achin'
Feel like it's a fuckin' earthquake where my brain is, huh, oh
Hell's Kitchen blazing
Cookin' coke off a slave master's bloody apron
I remember havin' a dream catcher when I was like ten
Set that bitch on fire, all my dreams been comin' true since (Been comin' true since)

Hit her with a bye-bye, bye-bye
You're out your mind
I'm out of pills
And you're out of lies
It stays dark outside
Even when it's daytime
Like, bye-bye, bye-bye
Uh, bye-bye, bye-bye (Bye)30Embed
