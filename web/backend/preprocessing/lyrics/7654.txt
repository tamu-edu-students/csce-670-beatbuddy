(Fall, yeah)
(Fall, yeah)
So baby, won't you fall?
So baby, won't you fall?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, can't you see I'm lonely, babe?
Caught up in my own misery
And I can't even say your name
Without letting it haunt me
If I go another night
I don't know if I'll survive
You told me that you needed space
So baby, won't you fall into me?

But I promise I'm tryin'
