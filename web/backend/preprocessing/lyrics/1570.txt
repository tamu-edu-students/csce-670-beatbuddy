(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
Lonely when you're in his arms
Yeah, you know I prayed for that, prayed for that, yeah
Your laundry dipped in my cologne
'Cause you know it takes you back, takes you back

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, do you ever miss me when I'm gone? (Gone)
Wonderin' what body I'll be on (On)
We can reconsider if you want (Want)
Baby, don't forget about me ever-er

[Chorus]
I hope the memory's killin' you over there
Don't even front, you know that you just can't compare
What it used to be
I hopе your jacket smells like mе
My baby, yeah
And when you touch him, does it really feel the same?
Or are you lyin' there, thinkin' about the way
That it used to be?
I hope your jacket smells like me
My baby
