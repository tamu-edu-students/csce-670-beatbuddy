24 ContributorsDon’t Be So Shy (Filatov & Karas Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take a breath, rest your head
Close your eyes, you're alright
Just lay down to my side
Do you feel my heat on your skin

[Chorus]
Take off your clothes, blow out the fire
Don't be so shy, you're alright, you're alright
Take off my clothes. Oh, bless me, father
Don't ask me why, you're alright, you're alright

[Verse 2]
Home I stay, I'm in, come in
Can you feel my hips in your hands
And I'm laying down by your side
I taste the sweet of your skin

[Chorus]
Take off your clothes, blow out the fire
Don't be so shy, you're alright, you're alright
Take off my clothes. Oh, bless me, father
Don't ask me why, you're alright, you're alright

[Refrain]
Don't be so shy

In my heart dress raised so much faster
I've drawn myself in holy water
And both my eyes just got so much brighter
And I saw God, oh, yeah, so much closer

[Bridge]
In the dark I see your smile
Do you feel my heat on my skin

[Chorus]
Take off your clothes, blow out the fire
Don't be so shy, you're alright, you're alright
Take off my clothes. Oh, bless me, father
Don't ask me why, you're alright, you're alright
Take off my clothes, blow out the fire
Don't be so shy, you're all right, you're all right
Take off my clothes and bless me further
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why, don't ask me why

[Refrain]
Don't be so shy
Don't be so shy5Embed
