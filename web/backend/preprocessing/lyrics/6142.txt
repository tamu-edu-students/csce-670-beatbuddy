37 ContributorsBuried Alive Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all
Chances are that you might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real
Still I'm on my way (On and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take

[Chorus]
Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive

[Verse 2]
I walked the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade (on and on it goes)
Wash my view away

Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever

[Bridge]
And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Take you down now
Burn it all out
Throw you all around
Get your fucking hands off me!
What's it feel like?
Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart
Now you're knockin' at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll
A price for you alone
The only deal you'll find
I'll gladly take your soul
[Verse 4]
While it seems sick
Sober up quick
Psycho lunatic
Crushing you with hands of fate
Shame to find out when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide
I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin
Release the dark within

[Outro]
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive
This is now your life (what’s it feel like?)
Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life (what’s it feel like?)
Die buried alive (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life
