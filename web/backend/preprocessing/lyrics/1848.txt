Now, I know that I can't make you stay
But where's your heart?
But where's your heart?
But where's your—
And I know there's nothing I can say
To change that part
To change that part
To change

[Verse 1]
So many bright lights to cast a shadow
But can I speak?
Well, is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete?
A life that's so demanding
I get so weak
A love that's so demanding
I can't speak

[Chorus]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

Can you see? My eyes are shining bright
'Cause I'm out here on the other side
Of a jet black hotel mirror
And I'm so weak
Is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete?
A love that's so demanding
I get weak

[Chorus]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

[Guitar Solo]

[Post-Chorus]
These bright lights have always blinded me
These bright lights have always blinded me, I say
[Bridge]
I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead (How can I see, I see you lying)
'Cause I see you lying next to me (How can I see, I see you lying)
With words I thought I'd never speak (How can I see, I see you lying)
Awake and unafraid (How can I see, I see you lying)
Asleep or dead
'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead

[Chorus]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone (Or dead)
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home (Or dead)
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone (Or dead)
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home (Or dead)
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone (Or dead)
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home74Embed
