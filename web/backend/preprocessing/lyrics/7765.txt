Take a hit, shoot me down, shoot me down
I will never hit the ground, hit the ground
Playing dead, I'll never do
Gotta keep an eye on you
Patience is wearing thin, paper-thin
Promises broke again, what a sin
But it only feeds my energy
So don't expect no sympathy

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke, fire, it's all goin' up
Don't you know I ain't afraid to shed a little blood?
Smoke, fire, flares are goin' up, flares are goin' up

[Chorus]
Oh, won't wave my white flag, no
This time I won't let go
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Won't wave my white flag, no
Oh, I won't go down slow
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Put an X on my chest, on my chest
But I'm still standing cause I won't forget
The hell on earth you put me through
I'll save myself in spite of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke, fire, it's all goin' up
Don't you know I ain't afraid to shed a little blood?
Smoke, fire, flares are goin' up, flares are goin' up

[Chorus]
Oh, won't wave my white flag, no
This time I won't let go
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Won't wave my white flag, no
Oh, I won't go down slow
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Bridge]
White flag never goin' up, never goin' up, no, no
White flag never goin' up, never goin' up, no, no
White flag never goin' up, never goin' up, no, no
[Chorus]
Oh, won't wave my white flag, no
(Wave my white flag)
This time I won't let go
(Won't let go)
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Won't wave my white flag, no
(Wave my white flag)
Oh, I won't go down slow
(Go down slow)
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Raise my white flag
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Won't raise my white flag, no8Embed White Flag Church Of Scars Bishop Briggs alternative
