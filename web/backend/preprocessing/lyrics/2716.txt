You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
Some day, you'll pay the price
I know

[Chorus]
I've seen it before, it happens all the time (Ooh-ooh)
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away (Ah, ah)
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay

[Verse 2]
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You want paradise
But some day, you'll pay the price
I know

[Chorus]
I've seen it before, it happens all the time (Ooh-ooh)
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away (Ah, ah)
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay
