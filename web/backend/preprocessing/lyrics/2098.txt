8 ContributorsTripping Over Air Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hear you talking in your sleep again
You're holding on to something real
Can't get enough of what's been in your head
Our secret's out, I'm feelin' this

[Pre-Chorus]
Is there something on your mind? 'Cause
You're the only thing on mine, love
Wanna tell you all the time, but

[Chorus]
I know
She likes boys that play guitar
Tattooed arms and a beat-up car
I know she's gonna break my heart
I know
She likes me when I play it cool
I can't help it, I hate the rules
I know she's gonna break my heart

[Post-Chorus]
But I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm trippin' over air tryna rеad your mind
No, I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm trippin' ovеr air tryna get it right

So why'd you go ahead and tell your friends?
You got me twisted up in how I feel
You love to start then stop then start again
But I hate the way that I'm feeling this

[Pre-Chorus]
Is there something on your mind? 'Cause
You're the only thing on mine, love
Wanna tell you all the time, but

[Chorus]
I know
She likes boys that play guitar
Tattooed arms and a beat-up car
I know she's gonna break my heart
I know
She likes me when I play it cool
I can't help it, I hate the rules
I know she's gonna break my heart
(I know but I don't fucking care)

[Post-Chorus]
But I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm trippin' over air tryna read your mind (Tryna read your mind)
No, I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm trippin' over air tryna get it right
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
She likes boys that play guitar
Tattooed arms and a beat-up car
I know she's gonna break my heart
I know
She likes me when I play it cool
I can't help it, I hate the rules
I know she's gonna break my heart
(I know but I don't fucking care)

[Post-Chorus]
But I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm trippin' over air tryna get it right (Tryna get it right)
