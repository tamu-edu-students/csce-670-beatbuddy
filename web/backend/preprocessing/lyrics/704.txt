Some days, you're the only thing I know
Only thing that's burning when the nights grow cold
Can't look away, can't look away
Beg you to stay, beg you to stay, yeah
Sometimes, you're a stranger in my bed
Don't know if you love me or you want me dead
Push me away, push me away
Then beg me to stay, beg me to stay, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum, Luke]
Call me in the morning to apologise
Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way you're looking through my eyes
Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive

[Chorus: Luke, All, Luke & Calum]
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go

Some days, you're the best thing in my life
Sometimes, when I look at you, I see my wife
Then you turn into somebody I don't know
And you push me away, push me away, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum, Luke]
Call me in the morning to apologise
Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way you're looking through my eyes
Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive

[Chorus: Luke, All, Luke & Calum]
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go

[Bridge: Luke & Calum]
Blood on my shirt, rose in my hand
You're lookin' at me like you don't know who I am
Blood on my shirt, heart in my hand
Still beating
[Chorus: Luke, All, Luke & Calum]
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go

[Outro: All]
