43 ContributorsWires Lyrics[Verse 1]
We talked about making it
I'm sorry that you never made it
And it pains me just to hear you have to say it
You knew the game and played it
It kills to know that you have been defeated
I see the wires pulling while you're breathing
You knew you had a reason
It killed you like diseases
And I can hear it in your voice while you're speaking
You can't be treated
Mr. Know-it-all had his reign and his fall
At least that's what his brain is telling all

[Chorus]
If he said "help me kill the president"
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming "let us in"
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh

[Verse 2]
He told me I should take it in, listen to every word he's speaking
The wires getting older, I can hear the way they're creaking
As they're holding him, well, I could see it in his jaw
That all he ever wanted was a job
He tells me to be raw
Admits to every little flaw
That never let him sit upon the top
Won't tell me to stop
Thinks that I should be a little cautious
Well, I can tell the wires pulled
You might also like[Chorus]
If he said "help me kill the president"
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming "let us in"
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh

[Bridge]
I'm having trouble in believing
And I just started seeing
Light at the beginning of the tunnel
But he tells me that I'm dreaming
When he talks I hear his ghosts
Every word they say to me
I just pray the wires aren't coming

[Chorus]
If he said "help me kill the president"
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming "let us in"
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
[Outro]
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh78Embed Wires I'm Sorry... The Neighbourhood alternative
