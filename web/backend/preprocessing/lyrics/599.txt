I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines 'til they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
All parties now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

[Instrumental Break]
(Uh, mm)
Uh
Mmm

[Verse 2]
I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the verses and the corrosion
Have been after native in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, "Taxi"
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
You might also like[Chorus]
(Here we go again)
That's electric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric
(Uh)
That's electric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric

[Verse 3]
Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away

[Chorus]
(Here we go again)
That's electric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (Uh)
That's electric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
That's electric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (Uh)
That's electric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric-tric
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)64Embed
