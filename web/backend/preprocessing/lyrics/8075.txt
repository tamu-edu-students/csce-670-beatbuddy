5 ContributorsDrowned in Emotion Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bright lights are fading
It won't be long before they've gone
The life that I'm making
And I don't wanna lose your company
I just don't believe it
That you would even scream my name
So if I don't belong, please tell me

[Chorus]
Falling through the cracks
I'm frozen underneath the lights
Forever, it ever builds
Till I'm drowned in emotion
Fighting through the fear
I've woken, nowhere left to hide
Forevеr, it ever builds
Till it's gone in a momеnt

[Verse 2]
I come alive
But still I feel this numbness smother all of my pride
Divided by a lack of truth
Surrounded, lost in solitude
Absorbing life and what it holds
To love and live before it goes
I can't carry the weight of all the world
You might also like[Chorus]
Falling through the cracks
I'm frozen underneath the lights
Forever, it ever builds
Till I'm drowned in emotion
Fighting through the fear
I've woken, nowhere left to hide
Forever, it ever builds
Till it's gone in a moment

[Bridge]
But now it's fading away
And no one even knows my name
So if there's a way, please tell me

[Chorus]
Falling through the cracks
I'm frozen underneath the lights
Forever, it ever builds
Till I'm drowned in emotion

[Post-Chorus]
But now it's fading away
And no one even knows my name
But now it's fading away
And no one even knows my name
[Outro]
So if you're fading away
And no one even knows your name
And no one even knows your name3Embed
