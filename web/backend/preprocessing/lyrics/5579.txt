Complicate this world you wrapped for me
I'm acquainted with your suffering

[Chorus]
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It falls on me

[Verse 2]
Hold me up to those whom you've deceived
Promises you break you still believe

[Chorus]
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it brings me down
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It falls on me

[Chorus]
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It falls on meSee Collective Soul LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like2Embed Heavy Dosage Collective Soul grunge
