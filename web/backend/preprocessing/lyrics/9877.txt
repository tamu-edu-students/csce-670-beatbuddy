10 ContributorsThe Hunter Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fame is in the front seat
Trouble with the kerb
Mama's in the back seat
Singing like a bird, oh no
Take me to the good life

Stranger on the mountain
Hanging on your words
Walking in a nightmare
Everything is blurred, oh no
Take me to the good times

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't forget what you told me
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing

[Chorus]
Watching, waiting
My prey is praying
There's no escaping
My blood's pumping
I go on hunting
The hunter, the hunted
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh-oooh-oooh

Papa's in the spaceship
Crashing through the air
Devil's in the details
Leap is in your hair, oh no
I can see the future

Take another picture
Drop it on your tongue
Let your body burn down
Breathe it in your lungs, oh no
Take me to your leader

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't forget what you told me
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing

[Chorus]
Watching, waiting
My prey is praying
There's no escaping
My blood's pumping
I go on hunting
The hunter, the hunted
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh-oooh-oooh
[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oooh-oooh-oooh
Take you to the red line
Bring you with the thorns
Buried deep in your mind
Soldier in the war, oh no
You can run but you can't hide

[Breakdown]
Watching, waiting
My prey is praying
There's no escaping

[Chorus]
My blood's pumping
I go on hunting
The hunter, the hunted
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh-oooh-oooh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh-oooh-oooh3Embed
