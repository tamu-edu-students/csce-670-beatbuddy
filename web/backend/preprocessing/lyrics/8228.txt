Tears down my face fallin'
I'm in the place bawlin'
If I ever find her, find her, find her
I'm sendin' shots (I'm sendin' shots)

Baby, you rewinding it all on me
Baby, give me time, beg you love, love me

[Verse 3: French Montana]
What you know about goin' out, big jet, big check?
Don't care, die for my respect
Life, we gon' live it up
Neck, we don't give it up
Dice, get, get 'em, girl, gon' bet it up
Grind and invest it
Invest like the main role, not the ex shit
X-rate movies like Netflix
Never domestic, watchin' her necklace
Young and I'm restless, you know who the best is
Three-quarter, Gucci Mane with the fur shoe
I got a girl, and the girl got a girl too
Hit me with the fab like put it in the bag
Pull up on my new ting, like I knew she mad
[Chorus: Stefflon Don & French Montana]
I heard you got a new girlfriend (Montana)
And it's hurtin' me
I heard you got a new girlfriend
And it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin'
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me
Yeah, it's hurtin' me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me

[Outro: Stefflon Don]
And I cry, I cry, even my eye cry
But who cares? Who cares?
And I cry, I cry, even my eye cry
But who cares? Who cares?
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey), yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey), yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah10Embed Hurtin' Me Hurtin' Me Stefflon Don;French Montana dancehall
