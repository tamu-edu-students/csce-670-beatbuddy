When the full moon turns white, that's when I'll come home
I am going out to see what I can sow
And I don't know where I'll go
And I don't know what I'll see
But I'll try not to bring it back home with me

[Verse 2]
Like the morning sun, your eyes will follow me
As you watch me wander, curse the powers that be
‘Cause all I want is here and now
But it’s already been and gone
Our intentions always last that bit too long

[Verse 3]
Far, far away, no voices sounding
No one around me and you're still there
Far, far away, no choices passing
No time confounds me and you're still there

[Verse 4]
In the full moon's light, I listen to the stream
And in between the silence hear you calling me
But I don't know where I am and I don't trust who I've been
And If I come home, how will I ever leave?You might also like10Embed
