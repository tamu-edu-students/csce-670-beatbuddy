3 Contributors​sex money feelings die (slowed version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Late night
Call you in the late night
Trade love for one night
Two pills and a red wine
Talk offline, no, I don't mind
The words that you don't say
No love when you hold me
No callin' the next day, it's a one-way, no

[Pre-Chorus]
And now the sun is up, I'm comin' down
(Nobody nowhere, I'm nobody nowhere)
We just blow it up, blow it out

[Chorus]
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Pain is on my right
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
(Sex, money, feelings, die)

Oh, I'm
Afraid of the sunlight
I don't care to be alright
Two lines, one time
Every night, every weekend, weeknight
Oh, my
Lights off when I wake up
Tears under my makeup
Your lips will stay shut
When we wake up, break up

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna think about, think about you
Drink up, drink up, I'm so fucked up, all I want is you
No, I don't wanna think about, think about you
Drink up, drink up, I'm so fucked up

[Chorus]
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Pain is on my right
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
[Bridge]
(All night, all night, all night)
All of these nights, sex, money, lies
(All night, all night, all night) Oh
(All night, all night, all night)
All of these nights, sex, money, lies

[Chorus]
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Pain is on my right
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Pain is on my right
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
(Sex, money, feelings, die)1Embed
