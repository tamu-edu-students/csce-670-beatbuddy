27 ContributorsUpside Down Lyrics[Intro]
I said, "Upside down, you're turning me"
You're giving love instinctively
'Round and 'round, you're turning me

[Chorus]
Upside down
Boy, you turn me inside out
And 'round and 'round
Upside down
Boy, you turn me inside out
And 'round and 'round

[Verse 1]
Instinctively, you give to me the love that I need
I cherish the moments with you
Respectfully, I say to thee
I'm aware that you're cheating
When no one makes me feel like you do

[Chorus]
Upside down
Boy, you turn me inside out
And 'round and 'round
Upside down
Boy, you turn me inside out
And 'round and 'round
