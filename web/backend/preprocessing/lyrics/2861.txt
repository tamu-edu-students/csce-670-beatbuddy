Please, could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head

[Chorus]
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)

[Verse 2]
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all

[Chorus]
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)

[Bridge 1]
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does

Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
That's it, sir, you're leaving (Rain down)
The crackle of pigskin (Rain down)
The dust and the screaming (Come on, rain down)
The yuppies networking (On me)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah112Embed Paranoid Android OK Computer Radiohead alt-rock
