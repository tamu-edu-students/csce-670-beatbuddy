18 ContributorsYou Proof Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been throwin' down the whiskey
I oughta get my money back
Someone said it drowns the memory
Aw, but it ain't doin' jack
Yeah, I been sippin', I been buzzin'
Shootin' doubles like it's nothin'
Aw, but nothin' makes you go away

[Chorus]
I need somethin' you proof
Somethin' stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I been pullin' ninety to a hundred
Feel like nothing's gonna cut it
That's the hard truth
Yeah, I need somethin' you proof
Aw, I need somethin' you proof

[Verse 2]
Poured 'em up 'til they shuttin' 'em down, yeah
You never ain't not around, yeah
Don't matter what time or town
I can't get you gone
Turned the bar, yeah, upside down
Just lookin' for somethin' that does it
I'd give 'em all my money

Ain't nobody sellin' nothin' you proof
Somethin' stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I been pullin' ninety to a hundred
Feel like nothing's gonna cut it
That's the hard truth
Yeah, I need somethin' you proof
Aw, I need somethin' you proof

[Bridge]
Hey, I been mixin' liquors tryna get you gone
Aw, but I must be doin' somethin' wrong
'Cause I been workin' hard to fade your memory
Baby, but the only thing faded is me

[Chorus]
I need somethin' you proof
Somethin' stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I been pullin' ninety to a hundred
Feel like nothing's gonna cut it
That's the hard truth
I need somethin' you proof
(Poured 'em up 'til they shuttin' 'em down, yeah)
(You never ain't not around, yeah)
Aw, I need somethin' you proof
(Don't matter what time or town)
(I can't get you gone)
[Outro]
(Turned the bar, yeah, upside down)
