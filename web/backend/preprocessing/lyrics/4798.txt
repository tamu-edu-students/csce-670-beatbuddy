5 Contributors24's Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy, yo, J, ayy, yo

[Chorus]
Gotta grind two-fours, every day of the week
That's the reason I'm struggling staying asleep (Facts)
And I love when I'm taking wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil', no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me (Ayy, yo)
Gotta grind two-fours, every day of the week
That's the reason I'm struggling staying asleep (Facts)
And I love when I'm taking wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil', no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliatеd, but I got bro like he got me

[Verse 1]
Had to grind and wait my turn
I ain't еver had olders to put me on
C-C-Can't wait till I see me a mil'
JBee's been hungry for way too long
And I been through so much shit
Can't you tell by the pain that I put in my songs?
Bro got beef then count me in, I'ma turn that shit to a 2v1
Me and bro like Ace and Mitch
He ain't ever been gang, but if they ever touch one of his
Then he promised to me that he's taking trips
He got me like I got him
I been juggin' from day till night
I can't stop till my paper flips (I can't)
And I been verified in rap, way before Insta' gave me a tick (Ayy, yo)

Gotta grind two-fours, every day of the week
That's the reason I'm struggling staying asleep (Facts)
And I love when I'm taking wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil', no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me

[Verse 2]
I ain't nuttin' like dem
I camp in the studio day till night cah my grind's intense
I'm one of the hardest to come out of my city
I swear I don't care if they take offence (I don't)
I didn't see me a single soul
Them times I struggled to make me a pent (That's right)
And it's either you're with me or not
I can't trust that yute if he sits on a fence
Lately, I've been focused on getting my bread
I swear I couldn't care what a pagon' says
I ain't ever been affiliated
But I back my bro, I ain't never been wet, huh
I don't need no ice, I still look lit in a Nike Tech
They been plotting to take me out
But they ain't managed to find me yet (Ayy, yo)
[Chorus]
Gotta grind two-fours, every day of the week
That's the reason I'm struggling staying asleep (Facts)
And I love when I'm taking wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil', no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me (Ayy, yo)
Gotta grind two-fours, every day of the week
That's the reason I'm struggling staying asleep (Facts)
And I love when I'm taking wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil', no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me

[Outro]
X10
Gotta make sure the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil', no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me1Embed 24's 24's JBee chill
