Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do

[Chorus]
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

[Verse 2]
Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

I'm still, ooh, still holding on

[Chorus]
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a billion different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces6Embed In The Stars In The Stars Benson Boone pop
