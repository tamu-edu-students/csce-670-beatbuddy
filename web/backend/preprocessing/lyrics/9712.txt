1 ContributorPick Me Up Then Let Me Fall Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, you don't wanna -
Yeah, you don't wanna -
Yeah, you don't wanna know, know, know [coughs]
Yeah

[Chorus]
You don't wanna know, 'bout the secret things I do
Baby, I've been feeling blue and it's all because of you
Write it on the wall, pick me up then let me fall
I been drippin' in the club, yeah, that's just what I do
Starin' at the ceilin', this the most euphoric feelin'
I don't know what I'ma do, this is all because of you
Write it on the wall, pick me up then let me fall
I been drippin' in the club, yeah, that's just what I do
You don't wanna know, 'bout the secret things I do
Baby, I've been feeling blue and it's all because of you
Write it on the wall, pick me up then let me fall
I been drippin' in the club, yeah, that's just what I do
Starin' at the ceilin', this the most euphoric feelin'
I don't know what I'ma do, this is all because of you
Write it on the wall, pick me up then let me fall
I've been drippin' in the club, yeah, that's just what I do

[Verse]
You don't wanna know 'bout the little things I do, yeah
I might fly away and act like I never knew ya
I just wanna love you, when I see you I feel golden
Piece me back together, yeah, my heart feels like it's broken
Pop a bean, so I think I'm in the future
Yeah, I'm going up, I wanna be above the skyline
I been smoking green, yeah, I think I wanna die high
Made this in my room, yeah, I put it up with Wi-Fi
All this drinking got me feelin' so elusive
All the views got me feelin' so exclusive (Yeah, yeah)
All this drinking got me feelin' -

Baby, I've been feeling blue and it's all because of you
Write it on the wall, pick me up then let me fall
I been drippin' in the club, yeah, that's just what I do
Starin' at the ceilin', this the most euphoric feelin'
I don't know what I'ma do, this is all because of you
Write it on the wall, pick me up then let me fall
I been drippin' in the club, yeah, that's just what I do4Embed
