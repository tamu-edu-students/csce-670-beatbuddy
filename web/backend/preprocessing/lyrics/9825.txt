I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

[Verse 2]
Now, this mountain, I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds, I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

[Pre-Chorus]
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

[Chorus]
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
Oh

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
