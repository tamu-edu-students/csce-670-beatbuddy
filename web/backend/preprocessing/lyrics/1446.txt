28 ContributorsCrazy Lyrics[Intro]
Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?

[Verse 1]
Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood
Girl, you've been givin' me that line so many times
It kinda gets like feelin' bad looks good, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That kinda loving turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving sends a man right to his grave

[Chorus]
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue

You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough
And tryin' to tell me that it's time to go, yeah!
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show, yeah!

[Pre-Chorus]
That kind of loving
Makes me want to pull down the shade, yeah!
That kind of loving
Yeah, now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same

[Chorus]
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue

[Bridge]
I'm losin' my mind
Girl, 'cause I'm going crazy
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I need your love, honey, yeah!
I need your love

[Chorus]
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
I'm losing my mind
Girl, 'cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me
