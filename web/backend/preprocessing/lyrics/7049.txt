Gabriel, ça peut être tout ce que tu veux, n'aie pas peur de tout vouloir, il n'y a pas assez de temps pour…
(keshi)

[Chorus: keshi]
Big ice, feelin' so fine
Shit is on me and we spendin' all night, come and
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Got my bag right, on my own time
Now these bitches tongue-tied
Tryna get on this side, better come and
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it

[Verse: keshi]
Paranoid, white noise, think they up to some
Come and take more when they give you none
See me doin' good, why you reachin'?
'Cause I got everything I ever needed
Got my money (Check), lady (Check)
Rollie (Check), mary (Check)
From the southside with my dawgies on deck
And we can't sit still less a chain on the neck, huh
Give me everything, trade you anything you want
All this cash on me, doesn't matter what it cost
Give me everything, trade you anything you want
All this cash on me, all-all this cash on me
You might also like[Chorus: keshi]
Big ice, feelin' so fine
Shit is on me and we spendin' all night, come and
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Got my bag right, on my own time
Now these bitches tongue-tied
Tryna get on this side, better come and
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it

[Outro: keshi]
Ooh
You don't even know which one you are
Do you?
Havin' trouble tellin' them apart5Embed
