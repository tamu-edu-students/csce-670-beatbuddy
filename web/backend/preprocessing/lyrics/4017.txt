8 ContributorsSpending My Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
What's the time? Seems it's already morning
I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue
The TV's on, but the only thing showing is a picture of you

[Verse 2]
Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee
I try to read a bit, but the story is too thin
I thank the Lord above that you're not here to see me
In this shape I'm in

[Chorus]
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time

[Verse 3]
I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
Oh help me please, is there someone who can make me
Wake up from this dream?

[Chorus]
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too
I'm spending my time (Spending my time)
Watching the sun go down (I fall asleep)
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "Tears of a Clown"
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time
You might also like[Bridge]
My friends keep telling me, "Hey, life will go on"
Time will make sure I'll get over you, ooh
This silly game of love - you play, you win only to lose
Ohuhohuhoh

[Chorus]
I'm spending my time (Spending my time, spending my time)
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time (Spending my time, spending my time)
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "Tears of a Clown"
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time

[Outro]
(Spending my time)
I can't live without your love
(Spending my time)
Uh, I'm spending my time, my time, my time
Bed's too big without you honey, honey
(Spending my time)Embed
