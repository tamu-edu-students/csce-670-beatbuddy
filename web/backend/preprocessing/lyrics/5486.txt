20 ContributorsLatest Trends (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Aitch]
She wouldn't know this
But my heart's all froze like my gold is
Yeah, I knew this role when I chose it
But I had to put it on hold for the trophies (Shit)
Yeah, love had to get put to the side
I got issues, how could I trust you for life?
Say you hate me today, gon' fuck me tonight
'Cause you still got hooked when you looked in my eyes (Woo)
E-E-Excuse me, miss
Can you make it clap in a two-seat whip? (Ah)
From the ends to the bougie bits
Babe, all my neighbours are stupid rich (Hahaha)
Got the hood in my blood, now your boy grown up
Think I've changed cah my taste еxpensive (Ha?)
But I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I'm good
Givе a fuck what the latest trends is (Ah-ah)

[Chorus: A1OrFundz]
You wouldn't know this, but my heart is cold like my home is
Where were you when we could've been homeless?
I can't have a bitch, 'cause I'd probably lose focus
You know, get lost in the moment
I could probably end up heartbroken (Yeah)
I was chasing a bag, you was chasing these hoes
Like I ain't got time to lotion
I'm tryna get high-igh-igh, I'm tryna reach the sky-y-y
Told her, "Babes, come, we bill it," she said, "Well, not tonight"

I said, "Ooh, come, we catch these yutes"
I don't take L's or lose
And me, I ain't got nothing to prove
I been out here with the goons
I was chasing a bag, you was chasing a yat
Two Hennessys straight, no chase when I yack
Two kettles, big Wraith, one babe's in the back
Reverse it, park up, put her face on my lap (Whoa, whoa)
They wouldn't love the kid if I was broke
Heard I'm making dough, now they're calling on my phone
I've got feelings, I ain't letting them know
Put my pain in music, that's the way that I cope (Yeah, yeah)
Counting my paper, still I can't count who I trust on my hand (No way)
From young been in love with racks
Few million, now I been had hundreds of grands (Woo)

[Chorus: A1OrFundz]
You wouldn't know this, but my heart is cold like my home is
Where were you when we could've been homeless?
I can't have a bitch, 'cause I'd probably lose focus
You know, get lost in the moment
I could probably end up heartbroken (Yeah-eah-eah)
I was chasing a bag, you was chasing these hoes
Like I ain't got time to lotion
[Verse 3: J1Mulla]
My bros in the lab like Dexter
And she wanna take this BBC and I ain't talkin' 'bout 1Xtra
Defend my bros like Evra
All my haters hating, I just tell 'em, "Back to sender"
I might bell her in, then put her right back like Héctor
The world's so fucked nowadays, all they do is follow and follow (Facts)
I don't care 'bout the latest trends 'cause I might even die tomorrow (Mhm)
That's why I ain't sleepy like hollow
If I ever win the lotto
I'll share that with my family
And make sure they don't borrow

[Chorus: A1OrFundz]
You wouldn't know this, but my heart is cold like my home is
Where were you when we could've been homeless?
I can't have a bitch, 'cause I'd probably lose focus
You know, get lost in the moment
I could probably end up heartbroken (Yeah-eah-eah)
I was chasing a bag, you was chasing these hoes
Like I ain't got time to lotion
I'm tryna get high-igh-igh, I'm tryna reach the sky-y-y
Told her, "Babes, come, we bill it," she said, "Well, not tonight"
