Never thought that I would actually miss you
Never thought that I'd be dying to kiss you
But maybe there's a first time for everything
Thinkin' 'bout you really messed with my heartbeat
Never thought that I would cry with somebody
But maybe there's a first time for everything

[Verse 1]
Saw her on the TV
Had the bleached pink hair with the ripped jeans
And I thought, "What if I could meet her in real life?" (Yeah)
I found out that we shared friends
So she came to the house on the weekend
And what I had in my head happened later that night (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need is one little memory
To make all these feelings come back up (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Never thought that I would actually miss you
Never thought that I'd be dying to kiss you
But maybe there's a first time for everything
Thinkin' 'bout you really messed with my heartbeat
Never thought that I would cry with somebody
But maybe there's a first time for everything

Stayed up, late night
We were trying our best to pretend, like
That when the party's done, we'll go our separate ways
But we knew, yeah, we knew
Pretty soon, it would be only us two
And after what we did, I'd never be the same (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need (I need) is one little memory (Oh)
To make all these feelings come back up (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Never thought that I would actually miss you, no
Never thought that I'd be dying to kiss you, but
Maybe there's a first time for everything
Thinkin' 'bout you really messed with my heartbeat (Messed with my heartbeat)
Never thought that I would cry with somebody (Oh)
But maybe there's a first time for everything (Everything)

[Outro]
Yeah
Maybe there's a first time for everything14Embed
