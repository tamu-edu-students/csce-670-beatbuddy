27 ContributorsSomething I Need Lyrics[Verse 1]
I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one life
It woke me up right after two
I stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn't lose my mind
And I had the week that came from Hell
And yes, I know that you could tell
But you're like the net under the ledge
When I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you only die once
I wanna die with—

[Chorus]
You got something I need
In this world full of people
There's one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You, you, you)
You got something I need
In this world full of people
There's one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You, you)

Last night I think I drank too much
Yeah, call it our temporary crutch, hey
With broken words I tried to say
Honey, don't you be afraid
If we got nothing, we got us
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you only die once
I wanna die with—

[Chorus]
You got something I need
In this world full of people
There's one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You, you, you)
You got something I need
In this world full of people
There's one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You, you, you)

[Bridge]
I know that we're not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it
To this time, this time
Now, yeah
[Chorus]
You got something I need
Yeah, in this world full of people
There's one killing me
And if we only die once
I wanna die with you, hey
You got something I need
In this world full of people
There's one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You, you, you)
You got something I need
In this world full of people
There's one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You, you, you)
If we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with—

[Outro]
If we only live once
I wanna live with you32Embed
