11 ContributorsZombie Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

[Pre-Chorus]
But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

[Chorus]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head?

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's the same old theme
Since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

[Chorus]
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head?

[Post-Chorus]
What's in your head?
What's in your head?
What's in your head?Embed
