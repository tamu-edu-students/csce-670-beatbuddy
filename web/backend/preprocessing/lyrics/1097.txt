10 ContributorsFrom the Subway Train LyricsWhen August comes
I don’t count the days
Transitory views
From the subway train
How strange
When life unfolds this way
In the driftless zone
Sky’s are prone to stay off-gray

Clouds are omens too
Fading at the rate
Most pleasant memories doYou might also like1Embed From the Subway Train Angel Youth Vansire indie
