12 ContributorsWait Another Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's a waste of time
But we'll be fine
Just picture me laying there
Right next to you
No, I tried every night
I'm back, before you know

[Chorus]
Don't you worry
I'll promise you that I'll be coming home
So trust me when I say
"I'll be back before you know"
I'm sorry if my side of the bed is getting cold
Just wait another day
I'll be back before you know

[Build]
Just wait another day
I'll be back before you know

[Drop]
Just wait another day
I'll be back before you know
Just wait another day
I'll be back before you know

There's no other way
But it's okay
Just picture me standing there
Right next to you
Got to stay, just not too late
I'm back before you know

[Chorus]
Don't you worry
I'll promise you that I'll be coming home
So trust me when I say
"I'll be back before you know"
I'm sorry if my side of the bed is getting cold
Just wait another day
I'll be back before you know

[Build]
Just wait another day
I'll be back before you know

[Drop]
Just wait another day
I'll be back before you know
Just wait another day
I'll be back before you know1Embed
