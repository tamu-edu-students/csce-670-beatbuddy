All her life, she has seen
Oh the meanest side of me
They took away the prophet's dream
For a profit on the street
Now she's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow
All his life, he's been told
He'll be nothing when he's old
All the kicks and all the blows
He won't ever let it show
Because he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

[Chorus]
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)
When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)

[Verse 2]
All the hurt, all the lies
All the tears that they cry
When the moment is just right
You'll see fire in their eyes
Because they're stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow
You might also like[Chorus]
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power
When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power

[Bridge]
She's got lions in her heart, a fire in her soul
He's got a beast in his belly, but it's so hard to control
Cause they've taken too much hits take it blow by blow
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode
She's got lions in her heart, a fire in her soul
He's got a beast in his belly, but it's so hard to control
Cause they've taken too much hits, take it blow by blow
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode

[Chorus]
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power
When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
