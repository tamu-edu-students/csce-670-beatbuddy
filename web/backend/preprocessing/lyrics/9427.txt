5 ContributorsCan I Kiss You? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drinks at the bar, gonna need it
Dance in the dark, if you feel it
Just tryna start a conversation with you
Maybe for once get the courage
Known you for months still make me nervous
What's holding me back I got nothing to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I hope you don't look at me as a friend
But I love it when you look at me like that

[Chorus]
So can I kiss you yet?
Picture the moment inside my head
Playing it out like a VHS
Over and over again
So can I kiss you yet?
From top to bottom
And once we start, there ain't no stopping us
Go all night
So can I kiss you?
Over and over again

[Hook]
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Over again, over again
You might also like[Verse 2]
Just like I thought, like no other
Hands on your skin, melt like butter
Can't get enough
And I love the way that you taste
Now that you're my piece of heaven
Still want you bad, more than ever
When I'm alone I'm impatiently waiting

[Pre-Chorus]
So hurry up, hurry up, come back
Cause I love it when you look at me like that

[Chorus]
So can I kiss you yet?
Picture the moment inside my head
Playing it out like a VHS
Over and over again
So can I kiss you yet?
From top to bottom
And once we start, there ain't no stopping us
Go all night
So can I kiss you?
Over and over again

[Hook]
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Over again, over again
[Bridge]
Sometimes sometimes, I don't know why we're fighting
You're probably right and
I apologise want it to be over
Have I ever told you
That I love it when you look at me like that

[Chorus]
So can I kiss you yet?
Picture the moment inside my head
Playing it out like a VHS
Over and over again
So can I kiss you yet?
From top to bottom
And once we start, there ain't no stopping us
Go all night
So can I kiss you? Kiss you?

[Chorus]
So can I kiss you yet?
Picture the moment inside my head
Playing it out like a VHS
Over and over again
So can I kiss you yet?
From top to bottom
And once we start, there ain't no stopping us
Go all night
So can I kiss you?
Over and over again
[Hook]
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Over again, over again
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Over again, over againEmbed
