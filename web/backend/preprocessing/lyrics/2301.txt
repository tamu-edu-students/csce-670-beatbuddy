Stop, drop
And drag me into place
And lock the fire escapes
I'll break your pretty face
(Nyeah, nyeah)

[Verse 2]
Oh, you clever little things
The sycophantic teens
What a precious basket case
(Nyeah, nyeah)

[Chorus]
Now shut your dirty mouth
If I could burn this town
I wouldn't hesitate
To smile while you suffocate and die
And that would be just fine
And what a lovely time
That it would surely be
So bite your tongue
And choke yourself to sleep
(Nyeah, nyeah)

[Verse 3]
You get everything you want
And money always talks
To the idiot savants
(Nyeah, nyeah)
You might also like[Chorus]
Now shut your dirty mouth
If I could burn this town
I wouldn't hesitate
To smile while you suffocate and die
And that would be just fine
And what a lovely time
That it would surely be
So bite your tongue
And choke yourself to sleep

[Chorus]
Now shut your dirty mouth
If I could burn this town
I wouldn't hesitate
To smile while you suffocate and die
And that would be just fine, oh
And what a lovely time
That it would surely be
So bite your tongue
And choke yourself
(Nyeah, nyeah)76Embed
