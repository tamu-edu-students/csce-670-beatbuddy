Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty, yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

[Verse 2]
Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away, I'd write it all
Even more in love with me, you'd fall
We'd have it all
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

[Bridge]
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never, ever be the same
And you're to blame

[Verse 3]
Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you
[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

[Outro]
Ho-oh, woah-oh, woah oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh, woah oh-oh oh woah
Oh oh-woah oh-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh115Embed
