I know they don't like me that much
Guess that I don't dress how they want
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else
Try to color inside their lines
Try to live a life by design
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else, someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
They yell, they preach, I've heard it all before
"Be this, be that", I've heard it before, heard it before
[Chorus]
Big boys don't cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don't fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in

Lately, it's been too much all day
Words shoot like a cannon at me
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else, someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
They yell, they preach, I've heard it all before
"Be this, be that", I've heard it before, heard it before

[Chorus]
Big boys don't cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don't fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in
[Bridge]
I am who I am, no matter what
Never changing, no matter what, no matter what

[Chorus]
Big boys don't cry
Shoot low, aim high (Ooh)
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don't fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in (Oh)
Big boys don't cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in (Oh)
Good girls don't fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in
