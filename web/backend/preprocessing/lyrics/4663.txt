Blind me
Erase what was
Stillborn I have become

[Pre-Chorus]
The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long

[Verse 2]
So empty
Just a shell of a man
Stillborn, this I understand

[Pre-Chorus]
The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long

[Chorus]
I’ve waited here for you, so long
I’ve waited here for you, for you

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long
You might also like[Chorus]
I’ve waited here for you, so long
I’ve waited here for you, so long
I’ve waited here for you, so long
I’ve waited here for you, for you11Embed
