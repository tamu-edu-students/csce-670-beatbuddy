Shady
Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one
Could she be that lady?
Ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me

[Chorus: Akon]
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now (Oh)
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

[Chorus: Akon]
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like "You're—"
I'm like, "I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place"
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)
[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)
Look back and watch me

[Chorus: Akon]
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more (Yeah)
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Akon]
Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D
Hittin' no less than three
Block wheel style like, "Whee!"
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately
[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)
Look back and watch me

[Chorus: Akon]
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh58Embed Smack That Konvicted Akon;Eminem dance
