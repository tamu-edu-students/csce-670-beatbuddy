86 ContributorsFull Clip Lyrics[Intro: DJ Premier]
Big L, rest in peace!
Do you wanna mess with this
I'm one of the best yet
We got it
You can feel the realness
In this business of rap
Go ahead

[Verse 1: Guru]
Fresh out the gate again, time to raise the stakes again
Fatten my plate again, y'all cats know we always play to win
G-A-N-G to the Starr, son
Haters took this shit too far, son
So that's all for you, I'm wipin' out your whole team
I'll splatter your dreams with lyrics to shatter your schemes
The badder you seem, the more lies you tell
The more lies you sell, and by surprise, you fell
Into my deathtrap, right into my clutches
Stupid, you know the God must bless
Every single mic he touches
I've suffered, just so I could return harder
Wanna be the shit starter, fuck around, make you a martyr
I make you famous, turn around, then make you nameless
‘Cause you never understood how vital to me this rap game is
Save it and hold that, you catch a hot one
Rhymes chase a fake nigga down soon as I spot one

Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good in this business of rep
Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good, so I suggest you take a rest

[Verse 2: Guru]
So if you stand in my way, I'ma have to spray
Learn that if you come against me, son, you're gonna have to pray
Since back in the day I held the weight and kept my head up
They wanna see the god catch an L, it's all a set-up
I give no man or thing power over me
Why these niggas so jealous and looking sour over me?
I'm bolder, G, I'm like impossible to stop
I'm like that nigga in the ring with you impossible to drop
I'm like two magazines fully-loaded to your one
Plus, I ain't gonna quit spittin' 'til you're done
Plus, more than ever I got my whole shit together
More than a decade of hits that'll live forever
Catchin' rep off my name, you're bound to fry
Know how many niggas that I know is down to die?
We never fail, and we ain't never been frail
You niggas talk crime, but you scared of jail
[Chorus: DJ Premier]
Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good in this business of rep
Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good
So I suggest you take a rest

[Verse 3: Guru]
Attackin' like a slick Apache, lyrics are trigger-happy
Blowing back your wig piece
Just for the way you're looking at me
Cock back, blaow, I hit you up right now
I don't know why so many of y'all wanna be thugs anyhow
Face the consequence of your childish nonsense
I could make your head explode just by my lyrical content
Get you in my scope and metaphorically snipe ya
I never liked ya, I gas that ass and then ignite ya
The flamethrower, make your peeps afraid to know ya
How many times I told ya? Play your position, small soldier!
My heart is colder, makes me wanna resort to violence
Stop beating me in the head, son, nah, I'm not buyin' it
I'm ready to blast, ready to surpass and harass
I'm ready to flip, yeah, I'm ready to dip with all the cash
I hold my chrome steady with a tight grip
So watch your dome already, 'cause this one might hit
[Chorus: DJ Premier]
Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good in this business of rap
Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet (The-the-the best yet)
I'm nice like that
It's all good, so I suggest you take a rest
