Meet me there
With bundles of flowers
We'll wade through the hours
Of cold, winter
She'll howl at the walls
Tearing down doors
Of time, shelter, as we go

[Verse 2]
And promise me this
You'll wait for me only
Scared of the lonely arms
That surface, far below these birds

[Bridge]
And maybe, just maybe, I'll come home

[Hook]
Oh, who am I, darling, to you?
Who am I?
Will tell you stories of mine
Who am I?
Oh, who am I, darling, for you?
Who am I?
Could be a burden in time, lonely
Who am I to you?
And who am I, darling, for you?
Who am I?
Could be a burden
And who am I, darling, to you?
Who am I?
