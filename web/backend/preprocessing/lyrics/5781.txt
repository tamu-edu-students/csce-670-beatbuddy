I wake up, my shoulders cold
I've got to leave here, before I go
I pull my shirt on, walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor
I pull my shirt on, walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I see you, you're walking 'cross the campus
Cruel professor, studying romances

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?

[Verse 2]
Walk to class in front of ya
Spilled kefir on your keffiyah
You look inside and turn to the door
Drag your feet along the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I see you, you're walking 'cross the campus
Cruel professor, studying romances

How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?

[Bridge]
In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class
In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class
In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class22Embed Campus Vampire Weekend Vampire Weekend indie-pop
