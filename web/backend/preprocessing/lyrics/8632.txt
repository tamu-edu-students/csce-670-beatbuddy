13 ContributorsTill It Hurts Lyrics[Intro: Bizzey]
Till, till, till it hu-hu-hurt
Till, till, till it hurt
Till, till, till it hu-hu-hurt
Till, till, till it hurt (Yep)

[Verse 1: Ayden]
Hold me tight, read my lips
Don’t need a word to say (Say, say, say)
Lay me down, blow my mind
Let’s take it all the way (Way, way, way)

[Pre-Chorus: Ayden]
Tell me will you love me tomorrow
Like you love me tonight? Oh-oh
See, we can worry about it tomorrow
Just give me tonight

[Chorus: Ayden]
Love me till it hurts
Make my body burn
Love me till it hurts
I need my heart to burst

[Drop: Bizzey]
(And bring on that bass)
Yellow motherfuckin' claw

If you want that real love, no fake love
That hard love until it hurts
That straight fire, no fake fight
We can’t stop until it hurts
Don’t you worry 'bout a thang
I’ma do you right
I’ma hit it in the morning
Like I do tonight

[Verse 3: Ayden]
Slow it down till my heart
Is ready to explode, -xplode, -xplode, -xplode
Bring it back, go down low
As far as you can go

[Pre-Chorus: Ayden]
Tell me will you love me tomorrow
Like you love me tonight? Oh-oh
So we can worry about it tomorrow
Just give me tonight

[Chorus: Ayden]
Love me till it hurts
Make my body burn
Love me till it hurts
I need my heart to burst
[Drop: Bizzey]
(And bring on that bass)
