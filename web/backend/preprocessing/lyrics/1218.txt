Hey you, big star
Tell me when it's over
(Cloud)

[Verse 2]
Hey you, big mood
Guide me to shelter
'Cause I'm through when the two
Hits the six and it's summer
(Cloud)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Come) Shove it, shove it, shove it
(Shove) Shove it, shove it, shove it
(The sun) Shove it, shove it, shove it
(Aside) Shove it aside

[Chorus]
I think God is moving its tongue
There's no crowds in the street and no sun
In my own summer

[Verse 3]
The shade is a tool, a device, a savior
See, I try and look up to the sky
But my eyes burn

(Aside) Shove it aside
(Come) Shove it, shove it, shove it
(Shove) Shove it, shove it, shove it
(The sun) Shove it, shove it, shove it
(Aside) Shove it aside

I think God is moving its tongue
There's no crowd in the streets and no sun
In my own summer

[Outro]

(The sun) Shove it, shove it, shove it
