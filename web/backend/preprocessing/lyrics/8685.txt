5 ContributorsOn My Way (Da Tweekaz Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment 'fore I go, it's nothin' personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm takin' my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way

So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way

[Bridge: Sabrina Carpenter]
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody, everybody, on my way

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
[Drop: Sabrina Carpenter]
(I'm on my way)
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my wayEmbed
