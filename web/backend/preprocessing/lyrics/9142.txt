52 ContributorsTherapy Lyrics[Verse 1]
My ship went down
In a sea of sound
When I woke up alone
I had everything
A handful of moments
I wish I could change
And a tongue like a nightmare that cut like a blade
In a city of fools
I was careful and cool
But they tore me apart like a hurricane
A handful of moments I wish I could change but I was carried away

[Chorus]
Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
And you can keep all your misery

[Verse 2]
My lungs gave out
As I faced the crowd
I think that keeping this up could be dangerous
I'm flesh and bone
I'm a rolling stone
And the experts say I'm delirious

Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
You can take back your misery

[Bridge]
Arrogant boy, love yourself so no one has to
They're better off without you (they're better off without you)
Arrogant boy cause a scene like you're supposed to
They'll fall asleep without you
You're lucky if your memory remains

[Chorus]
Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
You can take back your misery
Therapy, I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
You can choke on your misery41Embed
