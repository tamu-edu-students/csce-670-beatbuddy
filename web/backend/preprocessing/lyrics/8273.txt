Good golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
Good golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and rollin'
Can't hear your mama call

[Verse 1]
From the early, early morning
To the early, early night
When you caught Miss Molly
Rockin' at the House of Blue Lights

[Chorus]
Good golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and rollin'
Can't hear your mama call

[Verse 2]
Mama, Papa told me
"Son, you better watch your step"
If they knew about Miss Molly
I'd have to watch my Pa myself

[Chorus]
Good golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and rollin'
Can't hear your mama call
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Ah

[Chorus]
Good golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
Good golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and rollin'
Can't hear your mama call

[Verse 3]
Goin' to the corner
Gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you hug me and kiss me?
Make me ting-a-ling-a-ling?

[Chorus]
Good golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and rollin'
Can't hear your mama call2Embed
