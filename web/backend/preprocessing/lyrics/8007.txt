8 ContributorsGoing Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm going down
I'm going, down, down, down, down
Yes, I'm going down, yes
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
Yes, I've got my big feet in the window
Got my head on the ground

[Verse 2]
Let me down
And close that boxcar door
Yes, let me down
And close that boxcar door
Well, I'm goin' back to Chattanooga
And sleep on sister Irene's floor

[Guitar Solo]
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm going down
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
I'm going down
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
Yes, I got my big feet in the window
I got my head on the groundYou might also like3Embed
