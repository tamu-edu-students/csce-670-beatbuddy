1 ContributorLil Culture Just Smashed His Homie For 2 Pieces Of Macaroni Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Lil Culture just smashed his homie for two pieces of macaroni
Lil Culture's not lonely and sad, he's just sad and lonely
Lil Culture's doing jumping jacks with Jack in the Jack in the Box bathroom jacking slowly

[Chorus]
When Lil Culture's on his deathbed, he's gonna be reminiscing about the good old days When he'd play Leap Frog
All night long
When Lil Culture was born, it took a bunch of invisible dwarves to cut his umbilical cord

[Verse]
Lil Culture invented boards one day when he was bored
These rappers are just renting nice cars, they can't even afford a Ford
Lil Culture just sexually reproduced with a sea urchin
Shawty sucked it for so long that her knees hurting
Lil Culture's window is so big that he needs 3 curtains
Lil Culture's always in his bag, but he doesn't need a Birkin
Lil Culture rap battled everyone and they lost, Lil Culture told them to keep searching
Shawty never shakes her ass, but when Lil Culture steps in the room then she's twerking

[Chorus]
When Lil Culture's on his deathbed, he's gonna be reminiscing about the good old days When he'd play Leap Frog
All night long
When Lil Culture was born, it took a bunch of invisible dwarves to cut his umbilical cordYou might also likeEmbed
