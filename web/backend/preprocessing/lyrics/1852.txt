Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
I just fucked my ex bitch
Pull up on the next bitch
Like, "What's up? Give neck, bitch"
Please open your legs, bitch
No, I'm not your daddy, bitch
But I could be your daddy, bitch
Got big legs like a caddy, bitch
Really wanna fuck, send the addy, bitch
Know your daddy proud of you
Real bad bitch with a attitude
Know the whole school was fuckin' you
Really mad a nigga was cuffin' you
Really make a nigga uncomfortable, hey

[Refrain]
So where we go as we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?
So where we go as we walk this lonely road?
So where we go? Hey, hey

[Chorus]
I just fucked my ex bitch
Pull up on the next bitch
Like, "What's up? Give neck, bitch"
Please open your legs, bitch
No, I'm not your daddy, bitch
But I could be your daddy, bitch
Got big legs like a caddy, bitch
Really wanna fuck, send the addy, bitch
Know your daddy proud of you
Real bad bitch with a attitude
Know the whole school was fuckin' you
Really mad a nigga was cuffin' you
Really make a nigga uncomfortable, hey, hey
