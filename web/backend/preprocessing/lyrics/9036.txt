3 ContributorsBeautiful Girls / Stand By Me LyricsYou're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over

See it started at the park
Used to chill at the dark
Oh when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
Coz we both thought
That love lasts forever

See it's very divine
One of a kind
But you mush up my mind
You walk to get declined
Oh Lord...
My baby is driving me crazy

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do your dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over
See Boyce Avenue LiveGet tickets as low as $65You might also likeThey say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together

See it's very divine
One of a kind
But you mush up my mind
You walk to get declined
Oh Lord...
My baby is driving me crazy

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do your dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

When the night, has come
And the land is dark
And the moon
Is the only light we'll see
No I won't, be afraid
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
Just as long as you stand, stand by meEmbed
