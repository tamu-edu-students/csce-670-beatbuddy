68 ContributorsTears in Heaven Lyrics[Verse 1]
Would you know my name if I saw you in Heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in Heaven?

[Chorus]
I must be strong and carry on
‘Cause I know I don't belong here in Heaven

[Verse 2]
Would you hold my hand if I saw you in Heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in Heaven?

[Chorus]
I'll find my way through night and day
‘Cause I know I just can't stay here in Heaven

[Bridge]
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please
Begging please

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Beyond the door, there's peace, I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in Heaven

[Chorus/Outro]
I must be strong and carry on
