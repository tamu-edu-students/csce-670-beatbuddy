9 Contributors​universe Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Just hold me close (Just hold me close)
You keep me afloat (Keep me)
With you, I feel stronger, oh whoa
Just imagine all the little things we could do
Just imagine if I put my trust in you
Oh I, oh I (Oh I)

[Chorus]
'Cause you are my universe, my everything, my sunset
You still give me butterflies
My lullaby, you are
Everything I wanted (I wanted)
When you see me runnin' (Runnin', runnin')
Run after me, don’t let me go, ohh
Just imagine all the little things we could do
Just imagine if I put my trust into you
Oh I, oh I, run after me

[Verse 2]
I was down bad in a place where the sun don't shine
Had my head down, looked up, then you fell in my life
I was ducking all the signs (Oh), but look at how the stars aligned
You give me fever, you give me chills
Started as strangers, now look what we built
Oh I, oh I (Oh I)

'Cause you are my universe, my everything, my sunset (All that)
You still give me butterflies
My lullaby, you are
Everything I wanted
When you see me runnin'
Run after me, don’t let me go, ohh
Just imagine all the little things we could do
Just imagine if I put my trust into you
Oh I, oh I (Oh I)

[Outro]
My universe, my everything, my sunset
You still give me butterflies, ohh
Everything I wanted
When you see me runnin', run after me3Embed
