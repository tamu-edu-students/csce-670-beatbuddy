It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

[Verse 2]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

[Verse 3]
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around1Embed
