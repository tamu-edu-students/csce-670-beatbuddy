8 ContributorsClearest of Signs Lyrics[Intro]
Please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart
I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before
Nineteen made this
Please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart
I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again, I am delicate (OTR, them boy know wе are)
Please don't brеak my heart, trust me, I've been broken before

[Chorus]
You're scared if your heart gets broken, but darlin', have you thought 'bout mine?
You should know that I got you start to the end, let's do it like Bonnie and Clyde
I know that you watch your phone just ring, darlin', don't press decline
Trust me, it's fuck what they say, it's you that I want in the clearest of signs
You're scared if your heart gets broken, but darlin', have you thought 'bout mine?
You should know that I got you start to the end, let's do it like Bonnie and Clyde
I know that you watch your phone just ring, darlin', don't press decline
Trust me, it's fuck what they say, it's you that I want in the clearest of signs (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse]
Let's make it right if things go left (Ah, yeah), treat love like a game of chess
I read in more, but I speak up less and that's due to my toxic stress
Am I trippin' or does that make sense?
My time is a tough expense, it will cost you twice for your two-two pence
I can't lie-I can't lie, I'm obsessed with you, our hope is clear from a bird's-eye view (Our hope)
It's evident, you ain't got no clue, when I jump in the booth, I just think 'bout you (Oh, shit)
I don't know 'bout ip-dip-doo, my darlin' one, I do choose you
Throw it back like old school Looney 'cah he told me that you diggin' my tunes, got me feelin' to break in my goons

You're scared if your heart gets broken, but darlin', have you thought 'bout mine?
You should know that I got you start to the end, let's do it like Bonnie and Clyde
I know that you watch your phone just ring, darlin', don't press decline
Trust me, it's fuck what they say, it's you that I want in the clearest of signs
You're scared if your heart gets broken, but darlin', have you thought 'bout mine? (Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
You should know that I got you start to the end, let's do it like Bonnie and Clyde (Ooh-oh-ooh-oh, oh-uh-oh)
I know that you watch your phone just ring, darlin', don't press decline (Ooh-oh,oh)
Trust me, it's fuck what they say (Yeah), it's you that I want in the clearest of signs

[Outro]
Your h-your heart gets, gets, thought 'bout—, end
You should know that I got you start to the end let's—, Bonnie and Clyde
I kn-I watch your phone just ring, darlin', don't press decline
