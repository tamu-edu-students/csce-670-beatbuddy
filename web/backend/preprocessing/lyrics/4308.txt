Close your eyes, make a wish
And blow out the candlelight
For tonight is just your night
We're gonna celebrate, all through the night

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Pour the wine, light the fire
Girl, your wish is my command
I submit to your demands
I will do anything, girl, you need only ask

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Til you tell me to

[Verse 3: Wanyá Morris]
Girl, relax, let's go slow
I ain't got nowhere to go
I'm just gonna concentrate on you
Girl, are you ready? It's gonna be a long night
Throw your clothes (Throw your clothes)
On the floor (On the floor)

And I will do you right
Just make a wish on your night
Anything that you ask
I will give you the love of your life, your life, your life
