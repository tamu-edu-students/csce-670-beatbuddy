Alright
Whoa, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, no

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?" Yeah
She said, "Save your apologies”
Baby, I just gotta know

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady (Shady)
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh (Encore)
Ooh-ooh, ooh

You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She said "Boy, tell me honestly (Honestly, yeah)
Was it real or just for show?" Yeah (Is it just for show?)
She said, "Save your apologies" (Apologies, yeah)
Baby, I just gotta know
