1 ContributorDancing LyricsThe person you are trying to reach could not pick up the phone
Because they are probably dancing

Dance with the groove, all you've got to do is move
Dance with the groove, all you've got to do is move
Dance with the groove, all you've got to do is move
Dance with the groove, all you've got to do is move

Ten
Nine
Eight
Seven
Six
Five

One

Dance with the groove, all you've got to do is move
All you've got to do is move
The person you are trying to reach could not pick up the phone
Because they are probably dancing

Drop that thought 'cause we gonna hit the club
Let it drop, hit the club, 'cause we never gonna stop
Drop that thought 'cause we gonna hit the club
Let it drop, hit the club, 'cause we never gonna stop
Dance with the groove, all you've got to do is move
Dance with the groove, all you've got to do is move
Dance with the groove, all you've got to do is move
Dance with the groove, all you've got to do is move

The person you are trying to reach could not pick up the phone
Because they are probably dancing
Dance with the groove, all you've got to do is move
Dance with that groove, all you've got to do is move
All you've got to do is move

The person you are trying to reach could not pick up the phone
Because they are probably dancing

Drop that thought 'cause we gonna hit the club
Let it drop, hit the club, 'cause we never gonna stop
Drop that thought 'cause we gonna hit the club
Let it drop, hit the club, 'cause we never gonna stopEmbed
