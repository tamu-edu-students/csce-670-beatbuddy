[Verse 1]
I was caught in the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round and I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced and I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew there was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums beating in my heart
The thunder of guns tore me apart

[Refrain]
You've been - thunderstruck

[Verse 2]
Went down the highway, broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls, some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds
