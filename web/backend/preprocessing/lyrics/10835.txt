5 ContributorsOnlyFans Lyrics[Pre-Chorus: Prayer]
She on the 'Gram without a plan, now she got a OnlyFans
She want the bands, now you a fan
Out here flexin' on the 'Gram
She only drives a foreign
Call you when she is bored and
She never had a plan, she got her OnlyFans

[Chorus: Prayer]
She on the 'Gram without a plan, now she got a OnlyFans
She want the bands, now you a fan
Out here flexin' on the 'Gram
She only drives a foreign
Call you when she is bored and
She never had a plan, she got her OnlyFans

[Verse 1: Prayer]
She live up in the hills
She gotta pay her bills
She got a attitude, on God, that's why she taking pills
She got a OnlyFans, don't judge when you a fan
Designer on demand, life's hard without a plan
She in the hills, she in LA
If you got drugs, pass it her way
She want the bands up in the safe
She wanna know where she can stay
Everything, she want it, lifestyle on point and
Try to fall in love when she so private and so boring

[Verse 2: Yung Trench]
She only call me late night when I'm drifting away
I sent a double text and all she said she was, "Okay"
Don't care 'bout no one's feelings, she only want a check
She went and turned into a fucking money maniac
Lil' shawty boujee (Lil' shawty boujee)
But damn, she bad (Damn, she bad)
And if she only cared, I'd be the best she's ever fucking had
I wanna ride, hop on a wave
Jump on a flight, shawty, let's rage
And if you let me rock this evening, we gon' spend it on the weekend, yeah
