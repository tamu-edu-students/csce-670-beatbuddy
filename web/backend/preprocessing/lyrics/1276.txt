Eenie meenie miney mo
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla let her go

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
She's indecisive, she can't decide
She keeps on looking from left to right
Girl, come a bit closer, look in my eyes
Searchin' is so wrong, I'm Mr. Right

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You seem like the type to love 'em and leave 'em
And disappear right after this song
So give me the night to show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time
I'm not tryna rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
'Cause shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lover
Shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lover
Shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lover
Shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lover, oh

Let me show you what you're missin', paradise
With me, you're winning girl, you don't have to roll the dice
Tell me what you're really here for
Them other guys? I can see right through ya

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You seem like the type to love 'em and leave 'em
And disappear right after the song
So give me the night to show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time
Not tryin' to rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
'Cause shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lover
Shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lover
Shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lover
