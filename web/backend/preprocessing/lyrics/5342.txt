Watch it!

[Verse 1]
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the drivin' rain

[Chorus]
But it's all right now
In fact, it's a gas
But it's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Verse 2]
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back

[Chorus]
But it's all right now
In fact, it's a gas
But it's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas
Ooh!

[Verse 3]
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled, yeah, yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yeah, yeah
I was crowned with a spike right through my head
My, my, yeah

[Chorus]
But it's all right now
In fact, it's a gas
But it's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Outro]
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas9Embed
