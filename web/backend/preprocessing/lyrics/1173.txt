Mother
Tell your children not to walk my way
Tell your children not to hear my words
What they mean, what they say, mother
Mother
Can you keep them in the dark for life?
Can you hide them from the waiting world?
Oh mother
Father
Gonna take your daughter out tonight
Gonna show her my world
Oh, father

[Chorus]
Not about to see your light
But if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
'Til you're bleeding
Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's

[Verse 2]
Mother
Tell your children not to hold my hand
Tell your children not to understand
Oh, mother
Father
Do you wanna bang heads with me?
Do you wanna feel everything?
Oh, father
You might also like[Chorus]
Not about to see your light
But if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
'Til you're bleeding
Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Not about to see your light
But if you wanna find hell with me

'Til you're bleeding
Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's
