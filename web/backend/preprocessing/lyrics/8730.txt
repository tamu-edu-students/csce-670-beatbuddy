Please bring me back to life
I'm stuck too deep inside
Please take my hand
I wanna make you mhm, mmm

[Chorus]
Try to look fresher
Try to live better
I gotta get out of bed
I need a good kick, kick in the head
Try to lose pressure
Try to move faster
I gotta get out of bed
I need a good kick, kick in the head (Uh)

[Verse 1]
I know you're tired, tired of fightin' the world
I know you had it, it slipped out from under you, girl
I can't be honest, honest isn't kind
This ain't the hardest, you'll keep on fallin' behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Please bring me back to lifе
I'm stuck too deep inside
Please takе my hand
I wanna make you everything I got
It's easier to sleep
Than let go of my dreams
Please take my hand
I wanna make ya mhm, mmm

My motivation's smilin' from the heart
My inspiration, it always sets foot in the dark
And I can't change it, the spiral in my mind
You are my favorite, for you, I'll pretend like I'm fine

Please bring me back to life
I'm stuck too deep inside
Please take my hand
