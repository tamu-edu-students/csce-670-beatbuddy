8 ContributorsMoody Blue Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, it's hard to be a gambler
Betting' on the number
That changes every time
Well, you think you're gonna win
Think she's givin' in
A stranger's all you find
Yeah, it's hard to figure out
What she's all about
That she's a woman through and through
She's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue

[Chorus]
Oh, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hanging' on
Try to learn your song
But I never do
Oh, Moody blue
Tell me who I'm talking' to
You're like night and day
And it's hard to say
Which one is you

[Verse 2]
Well, when Monday comes she's Tuesday
When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday
Into another day again
Her personality unwinds
Just like a ball of twine
On a spool that never ends
Just when I think I know her well
Her emotions reveal
She's not the person that
I thought I knew
She's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue
