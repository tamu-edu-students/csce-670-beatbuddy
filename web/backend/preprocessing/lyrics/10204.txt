2 ContributorsYou & I (Emily Nash Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Baby, it's just you and I
When we dim the lights
It's just you and I
We can spend the night
Doing whatever we want
When we're all alone
And we're in the zone
When the fear is gone
Let's do whatever we want

I-I-I-I wanna get inside your m-i-i-i-nd
Pull your body close to m-i-i-i-ne
'Cause you're all I know
Don't wanna let you go

[Verse 1]
We can learn to love ourselves
We don't need nobody else
Baby, it's just you and I
There's no tearing us apart
Dancing in each other's hearts
Baby, it's just you and I-I-I
We can learn to love ourselves
We don't need nobody else
Baby, it's just you and I-I-I
There's no tearing us apart
Dancing in each other's hearts
Baby, it's just you and I-I-I
You might also like[Verse 2]
You're like a part of me
I can hear you breathe
Like it's a melody, that's playing over again
You answer all my prayers
Just by being there
Follow you anywhere
And do it over again ('Cause you and I)
I-I-I-I wanna get inside your m-i-i-i-nd
Pull your body close to m-i-i-i-ne
'Cause you're all I know
Don't wanna let you go
We can learn to love ourselves
We don't need nobody else
Baby, it's just you and I (Oh, oh)
There's no tearing us apart
Dancing in each other's hearts
Baby, it's just you and I (Baby, it's just you and I)

[Outro]
Baby, it's just you and I
Baby, it's just you and I
Just you and I
It's just you and I
It's just you and I
Baby, it's just you and I
It's just you and I (Baby, it's just you and I)
We can learn to love ourselves
We don't need nobody else
Baby, it's just you and I (Oh, oh)
There's no tearing us apart
Dancing in each other's hearts
Baby, it's just you and I (Baby, it's just you and I)
(Baby, it's just you and I) oh, oh, oh-oh
It's just you and I (Baby, it's just you and I)
It's just you and I (Baby, it's just you and I)Embed
