2 ContributorsI Can’t Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
The sun's shine in the winter
Leaves don't fall in the sea
You used to be such a dreamer
And now it's clear to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been trying to see the picture
Ooh, you better crop me out
I know I said I'd never leave you
But ooh, I'm so cold inside

[Chorus]
I've been thankful for everything you've done
But it is just not enough for me
I know you were there from the very start
But there's a lot you still haven't seen
I can't love

[Drop]
I can't love

[Verse 2]
Feelings blue as the ocean
Shit ain't always black and white
Wish I could explain this moment
But don't worries I can define
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I might drown, I might hide
I can't find this was a fight
You're my love, ask my friends
Baby, save your breath tonight

[Chorus]
I've been thankful for everything you've done
But it is just not enough for me
I know you were there from the very start
But there's a lot you still haven't seen
I can't love

[Drop]
I can't love

[Chorus]
I've been thankful for everything you've done
But it is just not enough for me (I can't love)
I know you were there from the very start
But there's a lot you still haven't seen

[Outro]
And I just want to say that it's all my fault
I hope that you find a better meEmbed
