Beams of fire sweep through my head
Thrusts of pain increasingly engaged
Sensory receptors succumb
And now I know all the agony

Bleed--it says, bleed you will

[Verse 4]
Falling into the clarity of undoing
Scornful gods haggle for my soul
Mind's eye flickers and vellicates as I let go
Taunting whispers accompany my deletion

A sneering grin, the voice of my reaper
Chanting softly the song of depletion14Embed
