23 ContributorsMovie Lyrics[Intro: Polly Misch]
"My cheek brushes against his
Smooth on stubble for a moment
And then it's gone
He walks along the platform as if in a dream
Every fiber in me wants to shout and scream
'Stop!'
To run across to him, to take him in my arms
To tell him, 'I love you! You silly, silly man, I love you!'
But instead I stand still
Heart cracking
Those little curls on the back of his head bouncing
As he steps out of my life, forever."

[Verse 1]
I hope that the fire we both made
Still burns a little in you
I wrote to you everyday
Did my letters find their way?
Our memories on my screen
Two lovers in this mystic dream
Baby, come back to me, come back to me
Too much time on my phone
Baby, do you still sleep alone?
Come back to me, come back to me
You might also like[Chorus]
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
But would you realize
What you meant to me or was it mystery?
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
But would you realize
What you meant to me or was it mystery?

[Verse 2]
I heard that you moved somewhere far away
Is your number the same as before?
I can't ignore
The time may have changed your ways
Does my record still hang on your wall?
Such a sentimental way to groove
I hope it still touches you
Baby, come back to me, come back to me
It kills me to see you leave
So I came home and made this beat
Baby, come back to me, come back to me

[Chorus]
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
But would you realize
What you meant to me or was it mystery?
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
But would you realize
What you meant to me or was it mystery?
[Outro]
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens13Embed
