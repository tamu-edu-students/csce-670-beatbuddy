18 ContributorsXanadu Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
A place where nobody dared to go
The love that we came to know
They called it Xanadu
(The tears you cried can't be denied)

[Verse 2]
And now, open your eyes and see
What we have made is real
We are in Xanadu
(The dream in you, they offer you)

[Pre-Chorus]
A million lights are dancing
And there you are, a shooting star
An everlasting world
And you're here with me, eternally

[Chorus]
Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu (Xanadu)
Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Xanadu, your neon lights will shine
For you, Xanadu

[Verse 3]
The love, the echoes of long ago
You needed the world to know
They are in Xanadu
(The love you gave, you'll dream away)

[Verse 4]
The dream that came through a million years
That lived on through all the tears
It came to Xanadu
(The dream in you, they offer you)

[Pre-Chorus]
A million lights are dancing
And there you are, a shooting star
An everlasting world
And you're here with me, eternally

[Chorus]
Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu (Xanadu)
Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu (Xanadu, Xanadu)
[Outro]
Now that I'm here
Now that you're near
In Xanadu
Now that I'm here
Now that you're near
In Xanadu
