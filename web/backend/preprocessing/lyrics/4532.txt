14 ContributorsRose (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see you driving your car down to school
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Your lips are so fine and you're looking so cool
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know you've noticed me too
And if I'll be honest with you now
Maybe, I'm thinking maybe
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
If you need a lover
Let me kno-o-o-ow and let me in
I could treat you better
Steal you ro-o-o-oses every day
I might not have a fancy car
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I fancy you
So gimme a chance
If you need a lover, baby

[Verse 2]
They look at me when I'm looking at you
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't give a damn 'causе it's all I can do
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Plеase don't go breaking my heart
Tell me you're aching for me now
Baby, baby
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you need a lover
Let me kno-o-o-ow and let me in
I could treat you better
Steal you ro-o-o-oses every day
I might not have a fancy car
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I fancy you
So gimme a chance
If you need a lover, baby

[Bridge]
Any flowers ain't your pain
I got so much love to give you, babe
As long as you feel the same way
You know we can do whatever you want
You just need to either let me come inside
Or leave me standing in the rain, no
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
If you need a lover
Let me kno-o-o-ow and let me in
I could treat you better
Steal you ro-o-o-oses every day
I might not have a fancy car
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I fancy you
So gimme a chance
If you need a lover, baby8Embed
