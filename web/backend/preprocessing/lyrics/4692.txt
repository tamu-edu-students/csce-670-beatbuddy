2 ContributorsWater LyricsI knew we would finally intertwine
You brought me back to safety
Too bad that we lost a lot of time (alright)
But i′ll get over that

I don't wanna overanalyse
I′m just so glad you saved me
Higher than a cloud up in the sky (alright)
And I just can't come down

We found our satellites
Don't let go don′t lose sight
Everything was mine (alright)
Everything was mine (alright)
Everything was mine (alright)
Everything was mine (alright)

I knew it when I saw you that night
My heart it felt complete and
Everything was perfectly aligned (alright)
It happened just like that

We found our satellites
Don′t let go don't lose sight
Don′t let go don't lose sight
We found our satellites
Don′t let go don't lose sightSee BICEP LiveGet tickets as low as $128You might also like1Embed
