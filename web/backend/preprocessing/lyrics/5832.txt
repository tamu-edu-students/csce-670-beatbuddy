Our day will come (Our day will come)
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy (We'll share the joy)
Falling in love can bring
No one can tell me
That I'm too young to know (Young to know)
I love you so (Love you so)
And you love me

[Verse 2]
Our day will come (Our day will come)
If we just wait a while
No tears for us (No tears for us)
Think love and wear a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay in love this way

[Chorus]
Our day will come
(Our day will come, our day will come)

[Pre-Chorus]
Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay in love this way

[Outro]
Our day will come
(Our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come
(Our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come
(Our day will come, our day will come)
