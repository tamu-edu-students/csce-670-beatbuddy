40 ContributorsDetroit Rock City Lyrics[Intro]
...Congressional reports
President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
In Detroit, a Pontiac, Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...
"..Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day..."

[Verse 1]
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You might also like[Verse 2]
Getting late, I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

[Instrumental break 2:55-3:27]

[Verse 3]
Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
Hear my song playing on the radio, it goes

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
[Instrumental break 3:54-4:35]

[Verse 4]
Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights staring at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why?

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Get up
