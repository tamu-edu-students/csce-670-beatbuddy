Fittin' in your vibe and you be stylin' out too quickly

Smokin' out the way I feel emotion

So good, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so new

Can't see ahead if I'm fine when I leave me
What is the sayin', "When you should let go
What is so impossible?"
Do me like that with a smile, with a smack
With a you nose, you know me, no? You know me better

Smokin' out the way I feel emotion
It's so good it's so bad, it's so bad it's so new
Wishin' at the end of June

[Spoken Bridge: (((O)))]
Take it down
I can't do it like that again, though
I'd have to listen to it a lot of times
And then memorize it, and then try to structure it
And realize that I should've just done nothing
