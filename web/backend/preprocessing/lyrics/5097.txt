16 ContributorsWoman Lyrics[Verse 1]
Woman, you know you're woman
You got to be a woman, I got the feeling of love
When you're, you're talkin' to me
You see right through me, I got the feeling of love

[Chorus]
She's a woman, you know what I mean
You better listen, listen to me, yeah
She's gonna set you free, yeah-ah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You're kinda lookin' at me like I've got to set you free
I can't be nobody
Well, you're kinda lookin' at me like I've got to set you free
I can't be nobody

[Chorus]
She's a woman, you know what I mean, no
You better listen, listen to me, yeah
She's gonna set you free, yeah-ah, yeah

[Instrumental Bridge]
