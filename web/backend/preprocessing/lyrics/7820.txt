5 ContributorsBack Tomorrow Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
And I don't wanna know what you did yesterday
I only wanna know you'll be back tomorrow
And I don't wanna know where you came from
I don't even wanna know where you're going
And I don't wanna know what you did yesterday
I only wanna know you'll be back tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna know where you came from
I don't even wanna know where you're going
And I don't wanna know what you did yesterday
I only wanna know you'll be back tomorrow
And I don't wanna know where you came from
I don't even wanna know where you're going
And I don't wanna know what you did yesterday
I only wanna know you'll be back tomorrow

[Post-Chorus]
You'll be coming back tomorrow
Coming back
You'll be coming back tomorrow

You fell out the sky
Came down from the stars and we were stoned
Magic in your eyes
You don't have to say a word
