16 ContributorsColors Lyrics[Verse 1: Ed Sloan, Mitch James]
Can you feel it crush you? Does it seem to bring the worst in you out?
There's no runnin' away from these things that hold you down
Do they complicate you, because they make you feel like this?
Of all the colors that you've shined, this is surely not your best
But you should know these colors that you're shinin' are...

[Chorus: Ed Sloan & Mitch James]
Surely not the best colors that you shine
Surely not the best colors that you shine

[Verse 2: Ed Sloan, Mitch James]
I know you feel alone, yeah, and no one else can figure you out
But don't you ever turn away from the ones that help you down
Well, they'd love to save you. Don't you know they love to see you smile?
But these colors that you've shined, are surely not your style
But you should know these colors that you're shinin' are...

[Chorus: Ed Sloan & Mitch James]
Surely not the best colors that you shine
Surely not the best colors that you shine

[Bridge: Mitch James]
I know you're feelin' like you're lost
But you should know these colors that you're shining are...
I know you're feeling like you're lost
You feel you've drifted way too far
Did you know these colors that you're shinin' are...
You might also like[Chorus: Ed Sloan & Mitch James]
Surely not the best colors that you shine
Surely not the best colors that you shine

[Outro: Mitch James, Ed Sloan & Mitch James]
Surely not the best
I know you're feeling like you're lost
Colors that you shine
But you should know these colors that you're shining are...
Surely not the best
I know you're feelin' like you're lost
You feel you've drifted way too far
Did you know these colors that you're shining are...2Embed
