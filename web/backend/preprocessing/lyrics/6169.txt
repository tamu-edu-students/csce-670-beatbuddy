[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
I know you want me
I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you
Now rock your body, oh-oh
Damn, I like the way that you move
So give it to me, oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause I already know what you wanna do

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
But tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh
