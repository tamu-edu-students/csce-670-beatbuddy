Let's go now, ow! Baby, take it out, let's see
Take it in, Carl
Hal, and his famous ashtray!
Get out of her, man (You're a big dude)
You smell like Rocky, you're always scratchin' it
Hey, come on!
Scratch it, Carl, scratch it, baby, right over there
Ah, down a little lower, down a little lower!
Saw—, tried—

Tried Peggy Sue, tried Peggy Lou
Tried Mary Lou, but I knew she wouldn't do
