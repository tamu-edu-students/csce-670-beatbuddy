[Intro]
In a church, by the face
He talks about the people going under
Only child know

[Verse 1]
A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep
And through a fractal on a breaking wall
I see you, my friend, and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we trip

[Chorus]
But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little (crazy)

[Verse 2]
Crazy yellow people walking through my head
One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Ohh, get it, get it, get it, get it no no
If all were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak

But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little (crazy)
No no, never survive, unless we get a little bit

[Bridge]
Oh darlin'
In a sky full of people, only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy
In a world full of people, only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy, crazy
In a heaven of people there's only some who want to fly
Ain't that crazy, oh babe, oh darlin'
In a world full of people there's only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy, isn't that crazy, isn't that crazy, isn't that crazy

[Chorus]
Oh, but we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little (crazy)
But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little (crazy)
No, no we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little bit
[Outro]
And then you see things
The size of which you've never known before
They'll break it
Someday, only child know
Them things
The size of which you've never known before someday8Embed Crazy Best 1991 - 2004 Seal british
