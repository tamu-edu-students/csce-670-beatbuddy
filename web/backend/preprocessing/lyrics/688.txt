Ho! Hey!
Ho! Hey!
Ho!

[Verse 1]
I've been tryin' to do it right (Hey!)
I've been livin' a lonely life (Ho!)
I've been sleepin' here instead (Hey!)
I've been sleepin' in my bed (Ho!)
Sleepin' in my bed (Hey! Ho! Ho!)

[Verse 2]
So show me family (Hey!)
All the blood that I would bleed (Ho!)
I don't know where I belong (Hey!)
I don't know where I went wrong (Ho!)
But I can write a song (Hey!)

[Chorus]
(One, two, three)
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet—
[Post-Chorus]
Ho! Hey! (Come on, now)
Ho! He-hey! (Woo)
Ho!

[Verse 3]
I don't think you're right for him (Hey!)
Look at what it might have been if you (Ho!)
Took a bus to China Town (Hey!)
I'd be standin' on Canal (Ho!)
And Bowery (Hey! Ho!)
She'd be standin' next to me (Hey!)

[Chorus]
(One, two, three)
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart

[Bridge]
Love, we need it now
Let's hope for some
'Cause oh, we're bleedin' out

[Chorus]
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet—
[Outro]
