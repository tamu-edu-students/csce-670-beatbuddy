Pink, it's my new obsession, yeah
Pink, it's not even a question
Pink on the lips of your lover (ooo)
'Cause pink is the love you discover

[Verse 2]
Pink, as the bing on your cherry
Pink, 'cause you are so very
Pink, it's the color of passion
'Cause today it just goes with the fashion

[Chorus]
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light
And pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight

[Verse 3]
You could be my flamingo
'Cause pink is the new kinda lingo
Pink, like a deco umbrella
Yeah, it's kink, but you don't ever tell her, yeah

[Chorus]
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light
Yeah, pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight

[Verse 4]
I... want to be your lover
I... want to wrap you in rubber
As pink as the sheets that we lay on
'Cause pink, it's my favorite crayon, yeah

[Chorus]
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah! Pink when I turn out the light
Yeah, pink, it's like red but not quite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight5Embed Pink Nine Lives Aerosmith hard-rock
