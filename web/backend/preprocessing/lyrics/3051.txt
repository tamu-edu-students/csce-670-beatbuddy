40 ContributorsMy Church Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’ve cussed on a Sunday
I’ve cheated and I’ve lied
I’ve fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

[Verse 2]
When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burnin'
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away
