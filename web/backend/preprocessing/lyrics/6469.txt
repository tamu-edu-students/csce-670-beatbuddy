52 ContributorsThe Funeral Lyrics[Intro]
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
I can't leave my bed, but I can't sleep
I got no clean clothes and I can't eat
And I smoke too much till I can't breathe
I'm emotional, I'll always be
And I hate myself, but that's alright
And I love myself, but that's alright
And I tell myself that it's alright
That I dream about the day I die

[Pre-Chorus]
To my surprise, there's no one to blame
Nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame

[Chorus]
I've been dancing at my funeral
Waitin' for you to arrive
I was hoping you'd look beautiful
Dancin' with tears in your eyes
But nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame

[Post-Chorus]

My hair fell out 'cause I dyed it cheap
I want a real fake smile, but I hate my teeth
I wanna tell you that I love you, but I just can't speak
I got a fucked-up soul and an STD
But do you hate yourself? Well, that's alright
Do you love yourself? Well, that's alright
Do you tell yourself that it's alright
That you dream about the day you die?

[Pre-Chorus]
To my surprise, there's no one to blame
Nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame

[Chorus]
I've been dancing at my funeral
Waitin' for you to arrive
I was hoping you'd look beautiful
Dancin' with tears in your eyes
But nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 3]
I wanna prove my love before I leave
I wanna make you come and scrape my knees
Want you to bite my tongue until I bleed
And you can put these fuckin' words in my obituary
We all hate ourselves, well, that's alright
We all love ourselves, well, that's alright
We all tell ourselves that it's alright
That we dream about the day we die

[Chorus]
I've been dancing at my funeral
Waitin' for you to arrive
I was hoping you'd look beautiful
Dancin' with tears in your eyes
But nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame

[Outro]
Nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame, shame, shame5Embed
