Close my eyes and drift into the silence
Barely see the ultraviolet
Slipped and fell into the deep end
Oh, the sidewalk shimmer just like diamonds
All the empty words were flying
Well, the heart was low, but I never was alone
I never was alone

[Chorus]
I've been running for so long
All that's left is skin and bones
Close my eyes, fight to carry on
Sometimes it makes no sense at all
If I stumble, will I fall?
If I fall, I'll tuck and roll
Close my eyes and let the love-light guide me home
Let the love-light guide me home

[Verse 2]
One step fades and falls into another
I'm not getting any further
Left here feeling like an alien
All the shiny sidewalks, they were lying
Lost myself while I was hiding
And the heart was low, but I never was alone
I never was alone

I've been running for so long
All that's left is skin and bones
Close my eyes, fight to carry on
Sometimes it makes no sense at all
If I stumble, will I fall?
If I fall, I'll tuck and roll
Close my eyes and let the love-light guide me home
Let the love-light guide me home

[Bridge]
Heart's so empty almost all the time
Blind devising ways to lead the blind
And it seems as if there's no end in sight
I don't wanna be there when it all goes down
But if I gotta be there, don't let me hit the ground
Can I hit the ground?

[Chorus]
I've been running for so long
All that's left is skin and bones
Close my eyes, fight to carry on
Sometimes it makes no sense at all
If I stumble, will I fall?
If I fall, I'll tuck and roll
Close my eyes and let the love-light guide me home
Let the love-light guide me home
Let the love-light guide me home4Embed Skin and Bones Social Cues Cage The Elephant blues
