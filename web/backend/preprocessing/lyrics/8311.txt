25 ContributorsRope Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
This indecision got me climbin' up the wall
Been cheatin' gravity and waitin' on the fall
How did this come over me? I thought I was above it all
Our hope's gone up in smoke, swallow your crown

[Pre-Chorus]
Choke! On our kiss
Thought I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On our kiss
Thought I'd save my breath for you

[Chorus]
Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm hangin' on you
Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm pullin' for you now
Gimme some rope, I'm comin'
Outta my head, into the clear
When you go, I come loose

[Verse 2]
These premonitions got me cryin' up a storm
Leave your condition, this position does no harm

Choke! On our kiss
Thought I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On our kiss
Thought I'd save my breath for you

[Chorus]
Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm hangin' on you
Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm pullin' for you now
Gimme some rope, I'm comin'
Outta my head, into the clear
When you go, I come loose

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm hangin' on you
Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm pullin' for you now
Gimme some hope, I'm comin' through
I'm countin' on you
Gimme some rope, I'm comin'
Outta my head, into the clear
When you go, I come
