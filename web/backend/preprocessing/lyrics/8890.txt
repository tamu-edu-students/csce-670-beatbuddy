32 ContributorsLife Eternal Lyrics[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Can you hear me say your name–forever?
Can you see me longing for you–forever?
Would you let me touch your soul–forever?
Can you feel me longing for you–forever, forever?

[Verse 1: Cardinal Copia]
I know the light grows darker down below
But in your eyes, it's gone before you know
This is the moment of just letting go
She said, “If you had life eternal”

[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Can you hear me say your name–forever?
Can you see me longing for you–forever, forever?
Would you let me touch your soul–forever?
Can you feel me longing for you–forever, forever?

[Verse 2: Cardinal Copia]
We dance once more, I feel your hands are cold
Within your heart, a story to be told
This is the moment of just letting go
This is the moment of just letting go!
(This is the moment of just letting go)
(This is the moment of just letting go)
(She said...)
