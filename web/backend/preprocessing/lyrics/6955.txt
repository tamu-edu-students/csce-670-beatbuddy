3 ContributorsSomebody (Linn Cover) Lyrics[Chorus]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody

[Verse 1]
You should've known better
Than to listen to your heart again
People change with the weather
(You know, just know what I like)
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else
You put it back together
Don't let it fall apart again
People change with the weather

[Chorus]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Somebody
Somebody
(You know, just know what I like)
Somebody

[Verse 2]
In my head I knew better (in my head I knew better)
I won't blame it on my faults again
I know I should forget her
(You know, just know what I like)
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else

[Chorus]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody

[Post-Chorus]
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(You know, just know what I like)
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(You know, just know what I like)
[Bridge]
'Cause I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody
'Cause I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody

[Chorus]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody

[Outro]
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(You know, just know what I like)
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(You know, just know what I like)
So don't tell me I'm like anybodyEmbed
