12 ContributorsYou Spin Me Round (Like a Record) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't want to know your name
And I do want your private number, baby

[Bridge]
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
I want some, want some

[Verse 2]
I set my sights on you
(And no one else will do)
And I, (I, I, I,) I've got to have my way now, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your loving arms
Watch out, here I come

[Chorus]
You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round
You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round
You might also like[Verse 3]
I don't want to be your friend now, baby
But I, I want to move it just a little bit closer

[Pre-Chorus]
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your loving arms
Watch out, here I come

[Chorus]
You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round
You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round

[Pre-Chorus]
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your loving arms
Watch out, here I come

[Chorus]
You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round
You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, roundEmbed
