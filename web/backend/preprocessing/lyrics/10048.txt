5 ContributorsFreak Like That Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I used to love you 'til you're sore and then some
Never used a label, but we knew what it was
Now you with somebody, but I know you too well
He gon' try his best, but he can't do it like us

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you feel it's not enough, got ways that I can help
Know it may seem like he's the one, but trust me, girl

[Chorus]
He won't break your heart, but he can't break your back
Like I can, makes me sad
'Cause I'm the one who taught you how to freak like that
Speak like that
It's too bad
So whеn you need that good loving (Yeah)
I could do what he doesn't (Yеah)
I'm the one that taught you how to freak like that
Freak like that, freak like that

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we don't gotta be in love to make it
Heard you settled for somebody, now you fake it (Now you fake it)
Just be honest with yourself, it's time to face it (Time to face it)
You don't wanna be in love, you wanna chase it
You want somebody who's a freak, seven days a week
Someone to give you what you need, and do it how you please
You know he's nowhere close to me
And that's why you ain't happy as you try to make it seem
I know this what you need
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So if you feel it's not enough, got ways that I can help
Know it may seem like he's the one, but trust me, girl

[Chorus]
He won't break your heart, but he can't break your back
Like I can, makes me sad
'Cause I'm the one who taught you how to freak like that (Freak like that)
Speak like that (Speak like that)
It's too bad (It's too bad)
So when you need that good loving (When you need that good loving, yeah)
I could do what he doesn't (I could do what he doesn't, yeah)
I'm the one that taught you how to freak like that
Freak like that, freak like that

[Outro]
I'm the one who taught you how to freak like that
Yeah, yeahEmbed
