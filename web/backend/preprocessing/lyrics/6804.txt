49 ContributorsSad Nibba Hours Lyrics[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, yeah, yo, uh
Plans that I had in the future
I remember I was thinking 'bout babies, whether a boy or girl
And what we would name it, It hurts we never made it
I just assume that you lie when you told me
You'll never leave me 'cause you deceived me
You so misleading, my heart is bleeding
And when I told you I love you, you said you love me too
What's even dumber than loving you, girl, is trusting you
Wish I could take back every minute I wasted on you
The pussy rejected for you, the memories invested in you
Not to be cocky, I'm the best guy, yay
You know this, you ain't gotta ask why, yay
I never thought that you would switch sides, yay
My heart is aching, I don't know why, yeah
And when it's said and done
I'm the only nigga who could ever make you cum
I'm the one who taught you face your fears and never run
You can have a lot but I'ma always be the one
And that's some real shit, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Sad nigga hours, uh
Sad nigga hours, yeah
Sad nigga hours, uh
Sad nigga hours, yeah
You might also likeHead under the covers, uh
I could never love another, uh
Sad nigga hours, uh
Sad nigga hours, yeah

[Verse 2]
I guess I just couldn't figure it out, used to be my everything
We turned into enemies, how?
Wrote a song about you
Was in love but it's meaningless now
Told me it's over, I swear my heart stopped
And since that day I swear it put me in a dark spot
But you gon' feel the pain
'Cause all the love that I gave was only pure
And you won't ever get this shit again
I used to tell you all the time, "I miss the old you!"
It's funny how over time what I'm learning is I don't know you
Used to get jealous of the niggas you would text too
You say he just a friend, but girl, I used to be your friend too
Looked for advice and all I get is bad tips, uh
Love is a drug and I only get bad trips
Some one-on-one conversations about how glad you are with me
But I guess you was just an actor, Grammy nominee
You thought that I was in the way but girl I wanted you with me
I guess my heart lied telling me that we were meant to be, damn21Embed
