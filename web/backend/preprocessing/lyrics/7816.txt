9 ContributorsFake Lyrics[Verse 1: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe]
I go to bed with these thoughts that I can't control
They're feeding on my brain like a cannibal
I wake up right before I find the antidote
And now there's one more chance left to crack the code

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe]
So I keep digging deeper 'til I
Find out what's underneath
When you pull the mask back and you're all alone
Tell me, do you like what you see?

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe, Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
Yeah, you're empty, you're hollow
The fakest one that I know
If you think that you're special
Well, there's your fucking problem
And whеn it all comes crashing down
There's no onе left to save you now
You're so fake, fake fake, fake, fake
Fake

[Verse 2: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe]
Well, every goddamn day it's another low
Make one false move that's your cover blown
The repercussions are yours and yours alone
You can hide from the world but not for long

So I keep digging deeper 'til I
Find out what’s underneath
When you pull the mask back and you're all alone
Do you like what you see?

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe]
Yeah, you're empty, you're hollow
The fakest one that I know
If you think that you're special
Well, there's your fucking problem
And when it all comes crashing down
There's no one left to save you now
You're so fake, fake fake, fake, fake

[Bridge: Eric Vanlerberghe]
So inauthentic, uninspired
Say goodbye, your time's expired
I am so sick and tired
Of all your self-righteous shit
(Oh, you're so fucking fake)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe, Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
Yeah, you're empty (Empty)
You're hollow (Hollow)
The fakest one that I know
If you think that (Think that) you're special
Well, it's not my fucking problem
'Cause when it all comes crashing down
There's no one left to save you now (To save you now)
You're so fake, fake fake
You're fake
You're so fucking fakeEmbed
