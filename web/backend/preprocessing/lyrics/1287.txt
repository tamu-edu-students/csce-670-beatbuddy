When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on

[Chorus]
Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts

[Bridge]
Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone
You might also like[Verse 3]
If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
Of this life to hang on

[Chorus]
Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts, sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes

[Outro]
So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts
No, no, no, no, no, you're not alone14Embed
