1 Contributor8:08 PM Lyrics8 minutes past 8 in the PM
We doing every night like the weekend
8 minutes past 8 in the AM
Wake up, nother day, we say amen

Parking pass on the dashboard
Cruising in the back of the RAV4
Pressing on the gas like fast forward
Hit the spot now we standing by the backdoor

They wanna chat about cash more
How they running outta stamps on they passport
That they always gonna grab what they ask for
When they talking, they gon always have the last word

They asking me like
What’s my project?
When’s it dropping? What’s the progress?
What’s up with the month of August?
It’s when I broke my trust and promise
Packed it up and shut those boxes
Cut my losses, fuck that nonsense
Must’ve got a conscience that with all my luck was struck unconscious
Recently so much exhaustion, suddenly a bunch of people walked in, I stopped I was shocked and I paused
When I saw her

We doing every night like the weekend
8 minutes past 8 in the AM
Wake up, nother day, we say amen

I stood up straight when I saw her
Like you do when people talk about posture
Been a while since responding to her calls, even talked to her
A stalker, I blocked her, walked into her, awkward

Met in secondary
We were tight like Ben and Jerry or bread and dairy
Now we only talk when it’s necessary
Said we’d be friends to the cemetery
But she meant it barely, it was temporary she overreached
Some dude hit her up
But she said we’re married, and then told him peace, oh for Pete’s

She extra like a cloverleaf
She overly attached, like she’s always watching over me
Been all over here and overseas
Copper by her ovaries
She a bad egg, that relationship was over-easy

Helped me solve my problems
But she’s the one who made them
Now everyday without her I say amen
8 minutes past 8 in the PM
We doing every night like the weekend
8 minutes past 8 in the AM
Wake up, nother day, we say amen

What happened last night
That’s right
Trap and black lights
And ratchet catfights, and my jacket hat swiped
By some random asswipe
But it happens that’s life

Fore I get outta bed, check my text messages
And my ex sent a pic
(Wait that’s my jacket)
Forget it start the checklist
Shit shower shave get some breakfast

And I’ve been moving on
But I still find myself writing stupid songs
I’m usually strong, what am I doing wrong
I’m trying but I can’t keep cool or calm
She got a soul devil red like a Louboutin
But in my mind all the red in those shoes are goneEmbed
