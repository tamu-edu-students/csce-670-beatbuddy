50 ContributorsLil’ Homies Lyrics[Intro]
Fuckin' lil' homies
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies
Lil' homies
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies

[Verse 1]
Just pay attention, here's a story 'bout my lil' homies
Straight thuggin', lil' bad young mothafuckas, gotta love 'em
You could catch him in his G ride clutchin' his Glock
Screamin', Outlaw! (Westside mothafuckas) bustin' on my enemy's block
Educated on these cold streets
Gettin' money, makin' dummies out the police
Ain't no peace for an adolescent nigga too wild to be a thinker
Bud smokin' 24/7, everyday drinker
Got my diploma, but I never learned shit in school
Mo' money, mo' bitches, mo' murder, fool!
Always the young niggas gettin' in shit
She wouldn't stop to conversate, so you called her a bitch (biatch!)
Bustin' on paper thin mothafuckas
Drinkin' gin before you get to sinnin' on them busters
Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies

[Chorus]
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets

I remember when you was just a lil' G
Flirtin' with death, playin' Russian Roulette, screamin', "Kill me!"
Hey there, young nigga, what you smokin' on?
Mad at the world ‘cause you came from a broken home?
Love the squad plus your mob is sick
A bunch of adolescent niggas spittin' major shit
Tell me, young nigga, if you die, let me know
Would your heart feel pain, watchin' as your mother cries?
Will all your homies ride?
Or will they all get high, and talk about how you died?
Young niggas on a mission to compete
Gettin' G's, packin' heat, bringin' havoc to the fuckin' streets
Nobody knows why he took a fo'-fo'
And unloaded on the whole front row (Buck! Buck! Buck! Buck!)
Try to tell him, but he act like he don't know me
Pull out his pistol and he show me; my lil' homie

[Chorus]
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
[Verse 3]
"First 2 Bomb," "16 On Death Row"
Bustin' on them phony mothafuckas ‘cause the big homie said so
Niggas knew I was a nutcase, quick to blast
Livin' underage, but he'll blaze on your bitch-ass
Is there a heaven for a G?
And if it is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streets ain't no peace, shell-shocked souls
Makin' money off of crack sales
Young black male unable to change ‘cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows the evil that they might do
Lil' Mu', Big Yak, K. Kastro
Big Malc, Hussein, call 'em Outlawz
Tellin' the world to be equipped
When these young mothafuckas rip shit, they don't quit
Drew down on me, pulled a pound on me
Bust like he didn't know me; my lil' homies

[Chorus]
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets

[Collision]
