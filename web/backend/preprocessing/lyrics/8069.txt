36 ContributorsTo Be Alone with You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'd swim across Lake Michigan
I'd sell my shoes
I'd give my body to be back again
In the rest of the room

[Hook]
To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you

[Verse 2]
You gave your body to the lonely
They took your clothes
You gave up a wife and a family
You gave your ghost

[Hook 2]
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
You went up on a tree

[Bridge]
To be alone with me
You went up on a tree

I've never known a man who loved me5Embed
