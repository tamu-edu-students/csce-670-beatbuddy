2 ContributorsTimes Like These - Acoustic Version Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away, follows you back home
I, I'm a street light shining
I'm a white light blinding bright, burning off and on

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

[Verse 2]
I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
But I, I'm a little divided
Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind?

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time againEmbed
