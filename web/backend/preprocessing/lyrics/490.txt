There lived a certain man, in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

[Chorus]
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how hе carried on
