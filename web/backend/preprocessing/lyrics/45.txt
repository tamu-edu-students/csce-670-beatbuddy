Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back, bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, fuck a first-class, I'm the pilot

[Verse]
Put it in perspective
Bitch, I got everything I wanted and some extra
I am not the type for turning into a detective
Got two of my own phones, barely even check 'em
Uber Eats the food, I don't call, I just text it
Cashed out on bail, my lil' bitch got arrested
Flexed out my Lexus, no backseats and no besties
I chеcked it, no guest list, so don't text mе
Ayy, two pistols, thirties in the clip, these akimbos
Open hand, smack him in his mitt, bitch, I'm Kimbo
You be throwing cash in the strip
My lil' bitch suckin' dick for the free
I got a bitch, but a bitch ain't got me
I know she trip when I dip, so I creep
These bitches pillow talkin' 'bout me like I'm sleep
But she ain't know this Gen3 was in my motherfucking tee

Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Propped up, fucking it from the back on an island
Heard they talkin' crazy 'bout my name, now it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back—

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back, bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, fuck a first-class, I'm the pilot6Embed BILLIE EILISH. BILLIE EILISH. Armani White hip-hop
