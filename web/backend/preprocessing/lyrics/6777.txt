16 ContributorsTouch Too Much Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was one of those nights
When you turn off the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do

[Pre-Chorus]
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

[Chorus]
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much

[Verse 2]
She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Like a thunder and lightning storm

It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

[Chorus]
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much

Touch me!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Seems like a touch (Touch too much)
You know it's much too much (Much too much)
I really want to feel, yeah (Touch too much)
Girl, you know you're giving me (Much too much)
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
'Cause you're much too much, too much, too much
[Chorus]
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Givin' me a touch, a touch too much
Lay me down and touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much

[Outro]
A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
Touch
Come on, touch me
Yeah!12Embed
