77 ContributorsJeremy Lyrics[Bass Intro]

[Verse 1]
At home, drawin' pictures of mountain tops
With him on top, lemon yellow sun
Arms raised in a "V"
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that Mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
[Chorus]
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

[Verse 2]
Clearly I remember picking on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooh, but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast, how could I forget?
And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurtin', ooh, dropped wide open
Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard

Daddy didn't give affection, no
And the boy was something that Mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
[Chorus]
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

[Bridge]
Try to forget this (Try to forget this)
Try to erase this (Try to erase this)
From the blackboard
[Chorus]
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today
[Outro]
(Spoke in, spoke in)
(Spoke in, spoke in, spoke in, spoke in)
(Spoke in, spoke in)
Ooh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh
Ooh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Ooh oh, oh, ay ay ay ay ay ay ay yeah! (Spoke in)45Embed Jeremy Ten Pearl Jam grunge
