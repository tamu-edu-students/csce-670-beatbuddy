28 ContributorsSilhouette Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stood at the cold face, stood with our backs to the sun
I can remember being nothin' but fearless and young
We've become echoes, but echoes, they fade away
We fall into the dark as we dive under the waves
(I heard you say)

[Chorus]
The devil's on your shoulder, strangers in your head
As if you don't remember, as if you can forget
It's only been a moment
It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger
Some silhouette

[Verse 2]
Let's go out in flames so everyone knows who we are
'Cause these city walls never knew that we'd make it this far
We've become echoes, but echoes are fadin' away
So let's dance like two shadows, burning out a glory day

[Chorus]
Devil's on your shoulder
Strangers in your head
As if you don't remember
As if you can forget
It's only been a moment
It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger (Silhouette)
Some silhouette (Silhouette)
You might also like[Bridge]
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me

[Chorus]
Devil's on your shoulder (Silhouette, ah-ah)
Strangers in your head (Silhouette, ah)
As if you don't remember (Silhouette, ah-ah)
As if you can forget (Silhouette, ah)
It's only been a moment (Silhouette, ah-ah)
It's only been a lifetime (Silhouette, ah)
But tonight you're a stranger (Silhouette, ah-ah)
Some silhouette (Silhouette, ah)
It's only been a moment (Silhouette, ah-ah)
It's only been a lifetime (Silhouette, ah)
But tonight you're a stranger (Silhouette, ah-ah)
Some silhouette (Silhouette, ah)
But tonight you're a stranger  (Silhouette, ah-ah)
Some silhouette  (Silhouette, ah)

[Outro]
(Silhouette, ah-ah)
(Silhouette, ah)7Embed
