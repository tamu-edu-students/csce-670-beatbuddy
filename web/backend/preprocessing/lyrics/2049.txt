Somewhere
Back in time
I left a part of me
I wanna see if you can try
To bring it back to me

[Verse 2]
You gotta go
Where I cry
And take in all the tears
I wanna see if you can try
Drink a little bit of me

[Chorus]
No
No

[Verse 3]
Just a little lonely
Where I am
Take me back in time
I wanna see if you can smile
If I become a better man

[Verse 4]
I need you - now I know
Just give me one more time
I'm gonna try and be your friend
So we can beat the end
You might also like[Chorus]
No
No
