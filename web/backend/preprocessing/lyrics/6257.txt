20 ContributorsPesetas Lyrics[Intro]
Rilès you're arrogant
You lift yourself up, you believed in your craft when nobody did
But we say arrogant
You dont know the game, you keep mentionning my name, "We dont like what you s-"
[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck, y'all can suck my dick
I'm making pesetas while they're talking, talking shit
Nah I don't give a fuck, don't waste my time for this

Please don't wake my dirty self up, please don't make me sane, nah nah
Please don't let me go look for you, the internet is not safe

[Verse 2]
They all want me dead, I piss them off, that's what I like to
You're sending me death threats in my mailbox, Mama we gon' move
Talk to me 'fore your talk 'bout me, yeah that's the number 1 rule
Many want my head, but where's the crown? It's on my balls fool!
Wow, wow, great, great
Don't show them that you've been loving yourself
Say you're ugly, say you're not the best, don't pump yourself up, they don't like them speeches
Wow, wow, great, great

Now I got girls who want my d*** and crazy dudes who want my head
Wait...

Nah I don't give a fuck, y'all can suck my dick
I'm making pesetas while they're talking, talking shit
Nah I don't give a fuck, don't waste my time for this
I'm making my dollars, dollars while they're tweeting tweets
Nah I don't give a fuck15Embed
