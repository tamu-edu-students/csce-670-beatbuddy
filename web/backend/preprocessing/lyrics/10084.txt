Summer comes, winter fades
Here we are, just the same
Don't need pressure, don't need change
Let's not give the game away
There used to be an empty space
A photograph without a face
But with your presence and your grace
Everything falls into place

[Chorus]
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when
You look at me like that
There's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back

[Verse 2]
Heavy words are hard to take
Under pressure, precious things can break
And how we feel is hard to fake
So let's not give the game away

Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when
You look at me like that
There's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back

[Bridge]
Fools rush in
And I've been the fool before
This time, I'm gonna slow it down
'Cause I think this could be more
The thing I'm looking for

[Breakdown]
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when
You look at me like that
There's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back
[Chorus]
Please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when
You look at me like that
There's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back

[Outro]
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back16Embed
