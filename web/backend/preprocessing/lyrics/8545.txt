Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Here I am, this is me
There's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be
Here I am, it's just me and you
Tonight we make our dreams come true

[Chorus]
It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
Here I am (Yeah, yeah)
Here I am

[Verse 2]
Here we are, we've just begun
And after all this time, our time has come
Yeah, here we are, still goin' strong
Right here in the place where we belong

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you

It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan

It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you (Waiting, waiting, waiting)
