[Verse 1]
Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman, he comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land

[Verse 2]
Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Now, I lay me down to sleep (Now, I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land (Yeah, haha haha)
[Outro]
Oh, yeah-yeah, yo-oh
We're off to never-never land
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
We're off to never-never land
We're off to never-never land
We're off to never-never land98Embed Enter Sandman Metallica Metallica hard-rock
