Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

[Verse 1]
Just get me to the airport, put me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh no-o-o-o-o

[Chorus]
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

[Verse 2]
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh no-o-o-o-o

Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-o-oh
