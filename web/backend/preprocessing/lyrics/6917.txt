3 ContributorsCut Me Loose (2021 Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll call you in the morning, don't you wake up late
No use in stalling 'til you hear from me
I'm working on something and I can't mess it up
Don't need permission, don't wait 'round for me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's getting harder to make it up to you
Can't leave the party, what am I supposed to do?
Intentions are good, but the music makes me bad, hot damn
Don't want me to go and I say
Mm-nah, mm-nah, oh, oh
Mm-nah, mm-nah, ooh, ah
Mm-nah, mm-nah, oh, oh
Mm-nah

[Chorus]
The rhythm makes me dance
If you don't like it, cut me loose
Promise none of this was planned
But if you don't trust me, cut me loose
Get caught up in the moment, can't help what I'm feeling
Tell me what is the problem? The night's only beginning
The rhythm makes me dance
If you don't like it, cut me loose
(If you don't like it, if you don't like it)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Question after question, but I've explained to you
Nobody's planned this, but it's where I should be
My body is yearning, waiting to be set free
So if you're not coming, don't wait up for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll call you in the morning, maybe just past two
Won't leave the party for you, that I can't do
Intentions are good, but the music makes me bad, hot damn

[Chorus]
The rhythm makes me dance
If you don't like it, cut me loose
Promise none of this was planned
But if you don't trust me, cut me loose
Get caught up in the moment, can't help what I'm feeling
Tell me what is the problem? The night's only beginning
The rhythm makes me dance
If you don't like it, cut me loose
Oh (If you don't like it)

[Bridge]
(Dance) Got a feeling I can't, can't stop the feeling, no
(Dance) Got a feeling I can't, can't stop the feeling, no
(Dance) Got a feeling I can't, can't stop the feeling, no
(Dance) Got a feeling I can't, can't stop the feeling, no
[Chorus]
The rhythm makes me dance
If you don't like it, cut me loose
Promise none of this was planned
But if you don't trust me, cut me loose
Get caught up in the moment, can't help what I'm feeling
Tell me what is the problem? The night's only beginning
The rhythm makes me dance
If you don't like it, cut me loose

[Outro]
Got a feeling I can't, can't stop the feeling, noEmbed
