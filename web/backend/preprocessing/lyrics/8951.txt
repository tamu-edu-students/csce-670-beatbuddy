Okay, Peppa, let's get you to bed
I am a bit of a sleepyhead
George, you have to go to sleep because it's nighttime now
Oh
I will sing you a song to make you sleepy

[Verse 1: Peppa Pig]
Time for bed, sleepyhead, the moon is in the sky
Time for bed, sleepyhead, the stars are floating by
Comfy and cozy and room and snuggly
Tucked up in your bed

[Chorus: Peppa Pig]
So close your eyes 'til morning comes
And good night, sleepyhead
Yes, good night, sleepyhead

[Refrain: Children]
Good night, Peppa, good night, George
Dream together, one and all

[Verse 2: Peppa Pig]
Time for bed, sleepyhead, daddy tucks us in
Time for bed, sleepyhead, the nighttime can begin
George and his dinosaur, me and Teddy
Are tucked up in our beds
You might also like[Chorus: Peppa Pig]
So close our eyes 'til morning comes
And good night, sleepyheads
Yes, good night, sleepyheads

[Bridge: Peppa Pig & George Pig]
Good night, George
Night, night
Sleep tight
And night, night, Mummy, and Daddy, and everyone

[Refrain: Children]
Good night, Peppa, good night, George
Dream together, one and all

[Outro: Daddy Pig]
Night, night, my little piggies
Sweet dreamsEmbed
