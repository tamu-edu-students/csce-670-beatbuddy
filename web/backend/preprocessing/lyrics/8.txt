I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out, no need to take it slow
I'm stepping to you toe-to-toe
I should be scared, honey, maybe so

[Chorus]
But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

[Post-Chorus]
I ain't worried 'bout it
I ain't worried 'bout it (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out so spend it like it's gold
I'm living like I'm nine-zeros
Got no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)
I'm at my best when I got something I'm wanting to steal
Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)
No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal
I'll take it in and let it go

Ooh, oh, no, no

[Chorus]
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below
