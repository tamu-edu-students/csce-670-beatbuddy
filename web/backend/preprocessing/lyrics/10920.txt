7 ContributorsFWM Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Hunnid stacks, all in cash, got the bag on me
Big dawg, I'm a boss, type of energy
Got the club goin' up, they all fuck with me
(Ooh-ooh, yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah)
Champagne and Ciroc and some Hennessy
If you keep on makin' problems, you gotta leave
Got the club goin' up and they fuck with me (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
Why you so uptight? You came in the wrong place
You know what you like, girl, you know you wanna stay
Them girls, they be tired, they too busy being fake
And I don't fuck with that shit
Girl, you know you should be livin' your life
You know that you got it
Mercedes, we drivin'
You should be excited
Three shots of that whitе, we finally vibin'
Oh yeah, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you work in thеm red bottom heels, girl, it's heavenly
Baby, you decide if you fuck with me
Showin' all the signs, girl, I know you're freaky
Oh-oh, ooh-woah (Yeah, yeah)
