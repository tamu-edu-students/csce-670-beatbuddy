Get ready for action!

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
This place was never the same again after you came and went
How could you say you meant anything
Different to anyone standing alone on the
Street with a cigarette on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene, I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Both]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)20Embed Feeling This blink-182 blink-182 punk-rock
