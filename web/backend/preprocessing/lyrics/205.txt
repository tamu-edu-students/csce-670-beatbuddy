43 ContributorsYKWIM? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey
It's not like you've ever tried to stay
Sometimes it seems like I'm in your way
Well, that's how it seems
Hey
You know what I mean?

[Verse 2]
Seems like I care too much
When I'm all alone, oh no
I feel like I care too much
When no one's at home for me
I feel like I'm falling out
Well, that's how it seems
I think that I'm falling out
You know what I mean?

[Verse 3]
Seems like I care too much
When I'm all alone, oh no
She said that I care too much
When no one's at home for me, ahYou might also like34Embed
