You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Verse 1]
What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine (Don't, all you)
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind (Don't)

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (All you, me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows
You and I are suicidal stolen art (Don't, all you)
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches' broken hearts (Don't)
You might also like[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (All you, me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Bridge]
Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me
Like you never do

[Outro]
Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "stay"125Embed
