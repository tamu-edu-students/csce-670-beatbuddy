Double D, big full breasts on my baby
(Yo, we goin' to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work?
Boss ain't workin' you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on you, girl
(Too weird to live and too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever, have I ever let you get caught? (Oh)
You might also like[Chorus]
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Bridge]
She's at a stove (Who?)
Can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (Cookin' dope)
I promise she'll be whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong)
No, nothin' wrong (Ain't nothin' wrong)
With a lie (Ooh)
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride (Ain't nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

[Chorus]
Lost (Ooh), lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost (Ooh)
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost (Ooh)

[Outro]
Love lost, lost
Lo—, lo—, love lost
Lo—, lo—, love lost
Lo—, lo—, love lost
Faith is the substance—
