7 ContributorsLady by the Sea Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dame with eyes of green
Legs lie soft on the sand beside the sea
With tilted shades, beaming eyes they looked at me
As if to say, "Pull in your reel, pretty boy
And stop lookin' this way"

[Pre-Chorus]
But, ooh, I love it
When you talk to me like you do

[Chorus]
Oh, my lady by the sea
Come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea
Come and lie next to me

[Verse 2]
Your voice, it blooms the flowers on the beach
With lips that glisten in the moonlight every time you speak
A somber tone of men I've known, being lonely
Oh, so lonely
But, luckily, luckily, she's got her eyes on me

[Pre-Chorus]
But, ooh, I love it
When you talk to me like you do

Oh, my lady by the sea
Come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea
Come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea
Come and lie next to me

[Outro]
Oh, my lady by the sea
Come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea
Come and lie next to me4Embed
