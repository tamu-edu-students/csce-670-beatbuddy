4 ContributorsSummer Feeling Lyrics[Intro]
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning
From a dream where we were floating through the sky
Counting the stars and
Wishing we could leave all of our fears behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Life was easy when you were with me
The sun was setting down, the world was ours
But life's not easy 'cause you're not with me
The world just feels like it's falling apart

[Chorus]
So, take me back to that summer feeling
Take me back to the start
Where the ocean's still warm with healing
And there's still love in my heart
Like a summer feeling
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Like a summer feeling
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Like a summer feeling

[Verse 2]
Playing in the sand
Our souls painting pictures of beautiful creatures
Lost without a hand
To hold on together and hold on forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Life was easy when you were with me
The sun was setting down, the world was ours
But life's not easy 'cause you're not with me
The world just feels like it's falling apart

[Chorus]
So, take me back to that summer feeling
Take me back to the start
Where the ocean's still warm with healing
And there's still love in my heart
Like a summer feeling
(Oh-oh-oh)
Like a summer feeling
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
So, take me back to that summer feeling
Take me back to the start
Where the ocean's still warm with healing
And there's still love in my heart
Like a summer feeling
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Like a summer feeling
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Like a summer feeling1Embed
