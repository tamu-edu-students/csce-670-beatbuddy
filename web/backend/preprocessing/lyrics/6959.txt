8 ContributorsWhere You Belong Lyrics[Verse 1]
If a summer last, stay by my side
These kids be growing fast, watch them by my side
When clouds are overcast, you there
Whenever I’m lost, wake me up, my dear

[Chorus]
When I open my eyes, I can’t hear your voice, I can’t see your smile
I have no choice but to close my eyes tight, 'til I know it’s for sure
You been there all along
Right where you belong

[Verse 2]
Through the darkest maze
Stay by my side
Over heavens grace
Right by my side, love
Don’t it feel like a roller coaster ride
These waves, big waves, moving with the tide

[Chorus]
When I open my eyes, I can’t hear your voice, I can’t see your smile
I have no choice but to close my eyes tight, 'til I know it’s for sure
You been there all along
Right where you belong
You might also like[Verse 3]
My dearest you hear me
This empty room loud
We had long conversations, I miss them so now
Ooh, closer, much closer
You where you belong
We lived and we loved
Forever, you living on (Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
When I open my eyes, I can’t hear your voice, I can’t see your smile
I have no choice but to close my eyes tight, 'til I know it’s for sure
You been there all along
Right where you belongEmbed
