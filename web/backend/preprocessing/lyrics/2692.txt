18 ContributorsHeadlights Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, I'm gonna use every heartbeat
Oh, oh, today not tomorrow
Oh, oh, I'm diving in so deep
Oh, oh, far from the shallows

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in the headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in the headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights

[Drop]
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hеla, headlights

Oh, oh, I got a taste of the good lifе
Oh, oh, I'll never let it go
A wild cat gotta use all my nine lives
Oh, oh, I'm gonna do it all

[Bridge]
And oh, I'm tipping on the edge
And oh, I don't wanna be saved
And oh, don't you pull a breaks
And oh, just take me all the way

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in the headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in the headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights

[Drop]
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hela, headlights

Oh, oh, I got a taste of the good life
Oh, oh, I'll never let it goEmbed
