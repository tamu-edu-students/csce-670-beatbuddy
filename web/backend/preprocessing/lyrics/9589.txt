25 ContributorsGirls on Film Lyrics[Intro]
[*Sound of camera shutters flickering*]

[Verse 1]
See them walking hand in hand across the bridge at midnight
Heads turning as the lights flashing out are so bright
Then walk right out to the four-line track
There's a camera rolling on her back, on her back
And I sense the rhythm humming in a frenzy all the way down her spine

[Chorus]
Girls on film
Girls on film
Girls on film
Girls on film

[Verse 2]
Lipstick cherry all over the lens as she's falling
In miles of sharp blue water coming in where she lies
The diving man's coming up for air
'Cause the crowd all love pulling dolly by the hair, by the hair
And she wonders how she ever got here as she goes under again

[Chorus]
Girls on film (Two minutes later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (Got your picture)
Girls on film

Wider, baby, smiling, you've just made a million
Fuses pumping live heat twisting out on a wire
Take one last glimpse into the night
I'm touching close, I'm holding bright, holding tight
Give me shudders in a whisper, take me up till I'm shooting a star

[Chorus-Outro]
Girls on film (She's more than a lady)
Girls on film
Girls on film (Two minutes later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (See you together)
Girls on film
Girls on film (See you later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (What you doing?)
