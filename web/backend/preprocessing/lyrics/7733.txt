90 ContributorsQuiet Storm Lyrics[Intro: Prodigy]
Done been through it all, man
Blood, sweat and tears, niggas is dead and shit
What the fuck else can happen, yo?
I don't think much more, son, word to mother, yo
We done seen it all, and been through it all, yo
Let y'all niggas know right now
Word to mother, for real, for real
That shit is the truth, I'm not lyin'

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
I put my lifetime in between the paper's lines
I'm the quiet storm nigga who fight rhyme
P, yeah, you heard of him, but I ain't concerned with them
Nigga, I pop more guns than you holdin' 'em
Make my route while the sun's out and scold your men
Unload ten in broad daylight, get right, fuck your life!
Hop on my '98 dirt bike
You try to stop mines from growin'?
I'll make your blood stop flowin'
Take affirmative action, to any ass if he askin'
Now here come the MAC-10
You's a dick blower, tryin' to speak the Dunn language
What the drilly with that though? It ain't bangin'
You hooked on Mobb-phonics, Infamous-bonics
Lyin' to the Pop Dog like you got it
You ain't no wildin' out for the Knife-Fist thrower
Rusty shank holder, we live this shit
You might also like[Chorus: Havoc]
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough
Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yo, the P rock forty-inch cables, drinkin' White Label
My chain hang down to my dick, my piece bang glass tables
Diamonds and guns before the fame, duke
A nigga like me hold TEC's, are you the same too?
Goin' through the emotions of gun holdin'
Long shotgun's down my pants leg, limpin'
Killa B, you still livin'
Even my pops too, he taught me how to shoot when I was seven
I used to bust shots crazy
I couldn't even look because the loud sound used to scare me
I love my pops for that, I love my nigga D-Black
I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left
And through all of that, a nigga ain't scared of death
All y'all brand new niggas just scared to death
I spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right
Wastin' my life, now I'm tryin' to make things right
Grand open some gates, invest in the rag business
Do things for the kids, the little thuns
Build a jungle gym behind the crib, so they can enjoy youth
CBR's and VCR's, ATV's and big screen TV's
Nigga, please, don't make me have to risk my freedom
We worked our whole life for this, you get your shit beat in
[Chorus: Havoc]
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
It go one, two, three to the fourth
That nigga P-Double got that shit for y'alls
Peoples to rock to, stirrin' up pots of brew
In Hell's Kitchen, I chef the impossible
To serve hot plates all across the Unified States
Sit down and sup with the top rap reps
We the streets that's watchin', boy, move diligent
You better walk like a nigga on a tightrope do
Infamous first infantry, first division, fourth mission
First assignment — give 'em that shit they been missin'
My new edition's way bitchin'
Those that listen get addicted to my diction
Fuck rhymes, I write prescriptions for your disease
Generic raps just not potent like P's
One-thousand-one-hundred CC's on the throttle
I peel off, chest naked on Katanas
Spaghetti head Mobb niggas is full bred
Fully-blown melanin tone
I rock skeleton bone shirts and verses
But thirst for worse beats
So I can put more product out on the street
Get respect and love all across the board
We've been adored for keepin' it raw
Nothin' less or more, I score every time for sure
While the rest of y'all niggas just nil
[Chorus: Havoc]
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough22Embed
