Hello, I'm Milk, I'm Etha
And I want y'all to keep it movin'
If you in the same club, witth the same jeans set on
With the same stanky attitude like a nigga owe you something cause you cute
Hoe, yo feet stink, wash yo feet, keep it movin'
If you a broke ass rapper
With a chain on as big as yo house and you been talking about that same chain in every last one of yo songs
Yo feet stink, and you whack, keep it movin'
[Keep it movin' keep it movin', (Uh-huh)
Keep it movin', (Damn right)
Keep it movin', (Hey, here we go again)] x4

(Verse 1)
I'm Etha
... I burn the beat up
... I keep the mil
And I keep the mike
I keep it hype
I keep the white
I keep the X
I see yo wife
I see a dyke
I send that dyke at yo wife now she yo ex
Did you know she's aerodynamically acrobatic, she could put her legs
Behind her head
She can flex
See the sex
... Is outrageously out the gate, and the frame... at the same time she's the best
Give me respect
See the rest
Cannot compare
My flow makes it impossible for y'all not to stare
Cause I'm a player and you're not a player
I'm Etha I heat the booth till I can't rap ?????
I'm magic on the mike
Damn right
Don't play
I'm tryin'a get back to the mix of things and that's why I'm in yo whole face
Oh hey
What you make a hour, what you make a day
What you make a week, let's add it up, let's make a trade
I hate to say that I don't hate to say
That you gotta pay
To play
Get it, yeah bitch don't pay to play
That hoe goin' stay away
It's Etha
I keep them heaters
I heat a freezer
I'm outta ?
Shit I'm hot enough to melt lava
??? is to live without water
Foo
Hard on the mike
And I'm hard on a bitch, if she black or white
Or blue
Hard on yo wife
And I'm hard on a dyke
Cause I'm charging her right
Oh yes it's true
Bitch I been around but ?? represent a ?
If struggles swallow me I know how negativity is

(Verse 2)
Look, move up out my line, you can't hang, this a one-way
Roll on the kush, see the
Etha
Meet the
Reefer
Tree
All day
E'er day
Keep it movin', plenty hay
Way down south
And yo mouth
Like a runway
Keep it keep it... movin'
Range Rover...drippin'
I'm flip-flop... flippin'
I'm tip-toe... tippin'
Creeping I'm ?? skittles the loudest I got the product head
At yo enchillada throwed off that fie water
Coulda
Woulda
Shoulda
All right nigga, shut up, you a flogger
Pull up right beside ya
Won't be no survival
Live and direct, lights camera and-a action
I'm the main attraction
You are a distraction
Yeah I'm movin' undaground, yeah I'm movin' skittles too
Double, triple stackers uh-huh, I got that fruity loop
Purple, Orange, even Yellow, yeah I got that kush kush
Monica Lewinski on my lap smokin' George Bush
