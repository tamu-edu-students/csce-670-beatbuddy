25 ContributorsShot in the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
I need a pick-me-up, a rollin' thunder truck
I need a shot of you
That tattooed lady wild like a mountain ride
I got a hunger, that’s the lovin' truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a long night comin'
And a long night pumpin’
You got the right position
The heat of transmission

[Chorus]
A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah, electric sparks
A shot in the dark beats a walk in the park, yeah

[Verse 2]
Blasting on the radio, breaking on the TV show
Send it out on all the wires
And if I didn't know any better, your mission is to party
'Til the broad daylight

And a long night goin'
You got the right position
The heat of transmission

[Chorus]
A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah, еlectric spark
A shot in the dark beats a walk in thе park, yeah

[Bridge]
My mission is to hit ignition

[Chorus]
A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark,
Yeah, electric sparks
A shot in the dark beats a walk in the park, yeah
A shot in the dark
Ooh, a shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark beats a walk in the park, yeah6Embed Shot In The Dark POWER UP AC/DC hard-rock
