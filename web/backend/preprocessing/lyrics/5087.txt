32 ContributorsAlive Lyrics[Verse 1]
Days go by my window
World slows down as it goes
Goodbye to last night
Lost my eyesight
Can't you help me see?
(They won’t get right)

[Chorus]
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Alive, alive

[Verse 2]
Waking in the snow
Tracing steps with you
Swimming through the smoke
Wrapped in velvet gold
Can't you help me see?
(They won’t get right)

[Chorus]
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Alive, alive
You might also like[Bridge]
Can you describe to me
All the world that you see?
Oh, I need you so much
I’ll just wait, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Freedom is within you
Giving makes us feel good
Hello to our people
Say hello to the future
Freedom is within you
Giving makes us feel good
Hello to our people
Say hello to the future

[Chorus]
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Alive, alive
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Alive, alive27Embed
