I'd come through around two
And pick you up right after your shift (After your shift)
And drive that Chevrolet like a getaway
You'd be countin' your tips (Countin' your tips)

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Katy Perry]
Windows down and screamin' out
World, wait for us
Everybody, just wait for us
Yeah, we're comin', just wait for us

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Those days when you're brokenhearted
And you get knocked down
And you say you don't know how far we're gonna go
Just look at that road and think about where we started
Keep your eyes on me 'cause talk is cheap
We're all we need, yeah
Darlin', I know how far we're gonna go
Just look at that road and think about where we started

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
I'd be playin' my guitar
Singin' them covers in an empty room (Covers in an empty room)
You knew one day I would make a
Livin' out of singing 'bout you (Livin' out of singin' 'bout you)
