40 ContributorsDissolve Lyrics[Verse 1]
No flask can keep it
Bubble up and cut right through
But you're someone I believe in
You heat me like a filament
Anytime you're in the room
But you burned me and I'm smoking

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble

[Verse 2]
Can't find an exit
I wander in a maze alone
If I find you will you shock me?
Left, left and right, right
Pretty sure that I've been here before
And it isn't what I wanted

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
You might also like[Bridge]
Your voice like an angel
Been chainsmoking all month long
Like you're someone I believe in
Am I only a lab rat?
Someone you can test things on?
This isn't what I signed up for
I just wanted you to
I just wanted (Wanted)
I just wanted you to
I just wanted (Wanted)

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
[Outro]
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly17Embed Dissolve Thousand Peaces Absofacto indie-pop
