Thought I'd seen good days but that was until I met you
For I've come so far here on my own
So hear me out before you go
Because I see a life with you
And I wonder why I've been making do
All the rules that I've made only to have them break
I'm here today, it's okay, please tell me

[Chorus]
Was it you, was it?
Keeping the lights on swore that I couldn't
Thought I survived it all before you came around
I was alone in my head instead
If you let me try
Was it you, was it? (I'll do this right)
Was it you, was it? (Even if I fail a thousand times)
Was it something you said?
Did you try to tell me?

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at all sometimes
The morning comes but where the fuck am I?
That's when I look into your eyes and I'm glad you're with me
Through all of the times I refused to accept
The boy that was with me and never left
All the rules that I've made only to have them break
I'm here today, it's okay, please tell me

Was it you, was it?
Keeping the lights on swore that I couldn't
Thought I survived it all before you came around
I was alone in my head instead

Was it you, was it?
Falling in love with walls that I've tainted
Opening doors, I don't remember anymore
Was it something you said?
Did you try to tell me?
Was it you, was it?
If you let me try
(I'll do this right)
Was it you, was it?
(Even if I fail a thousand times)
Was it something you said?
Did you try to tell me?

[Outro]
Was it you, was it?
Keeping the lights on swore that I couldn't
Opening doors, I don't remember anymore
Was it something you said?
Did you try to tell me?
If you let me try
I'll do this right
Even if I fail a thousand times
If you let me try (if you just let me try)
I'll do this right (I just wanna do this right)
Even if I fail a thousand timesEmbed
