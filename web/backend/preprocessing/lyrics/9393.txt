4 ContributorsLie 2 Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was a mess but we just never knew
I know you did everything you could do
Our love was red and now it turned to blue
It was the only way to know the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
But when I see you it hurts, when I see you it starts to hurt baby
I can see it in your eyes, I can see the pain in your eyes I'm sorry
Tell me baby did it feel right
To be with you and at the same time
Lose myself, my soul is burning out so casually

[Chorus]
Lie to me, oh won't you lie to me
Give me reason to the pain
My love you were so
Right for me, oh you were right for me
But darling we don't hurt the same
Oh baby I'm a shame

[Hook]
Tell me everything you need to say
Tell me everything you need to say

[Verse 2]
I never thought that it would end like this
You promised nothing but eternal bliss
The joy and comfort that you gave, I miss
Oh are we more than this, please tell me baby cause im lost

But when I see you it hurts, when I see you it starts to hurt baby
I can see it in your eyes, I can see the pain in your eyes I'm sorry
Tell me baby did it feel right
To be with you and at the same time
Lose myself, my soul is burning out so casually

[Chorus]
Lie to me, oh won't you lie to me
Give me reason to the pain
My love you were so
Right for me, oh you were right for me
But darling we don't hurt the same
Oh baby I'm a shame

[Chorus]
Lie to me, oh won't you lie to me
Give me reason to the pain
My love you were so
Right for me, oh you were right for me
But darling we don't hurt the same
Oh baby I'm a shame

[Hook]
Tell me everything you need to say
Tell me everything you need to say1Embed
