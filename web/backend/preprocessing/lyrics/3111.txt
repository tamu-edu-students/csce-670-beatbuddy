Do you ever feel like breakin' down?
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears your screamin'?

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you don't know what it's like
When nothin' feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

[Chorus]
To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breakin' down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feelin' so left out?
Are you desperate to find somethin' more
Before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleedin'

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you don't know what it's like
When nothin' feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

[Chorus]
To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breakin' down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life
[Bridge]
No one ever lied straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy, but I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work, it was always there
You don't know what it's like, what it's like

[Chorus]
To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breakin' down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like (What it's like)
To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breakin' down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
