Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
[Verse 2]
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

[Verse 3]
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
You might also like[Bridge]
Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying, baby, baby, please

[Middle-Eight]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

[Verse 4]
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

[Refrain]
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
[Outro]
