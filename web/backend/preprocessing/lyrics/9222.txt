It's dangerous to be a woman in love
I'm walkin' quicker, but you're pickin' up
Feel like I'm navigatin' muddy waters
Heal us
My daddy told me call him when I get home
But you consume me when I'm all alone
I'm hoping we can find deliverance
Heal us

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna die for love
But a holy love
That one and only love
My life is worthy of

[Chorus]
Dancin' in the dark, I can feel it in my heart, you're a killer
But I didn't wanna call it
Something in the way you put your hands on my waist, pulled me nearer
No, I never wanna call it
Didn't wanna call it, didn't wanna call it
Took your love for righteous and now I'm in a crisis with a killer
Woah

[Verse 2]
You got me questionin' what to believe in
Since when did happiness become a sin?
Since when did hurt become deliberate?
Heal us

I don't wanna cry for love
But a holy love
That one and only love
My tears are worthy of

[Chorus]
Dancin' in the dark, I can feel it in my heart, you're a killer
But I didn't wanna call it
Something in the way you put your hands on my waist, pulled me nearer
No, I never wanna call it
Didn't wanna call it, didn't wanna call it
Took your love for righteous and now I'm in a crisis with a killer
Woah

[Bridge]
When I doubt myself around you
I look at pictures of me before you
Girl gone wild
I'll shave my hair off to get you out of my head
And even eating's hard without you
When it's your love, I want to consume, it's true
Hunger pains, no, I can't live without you

[Chorus]
Dancin' in the dark, I can feel it in my heart, you're a killer
But I didn't wanna call it
Something in the way you put your hands on my waist, pulled me nearer
No, I never wanna call it
Didn't wanna call it, didn't wanna call it
Took your love for righteous and now I'm in a crisis with a killer
