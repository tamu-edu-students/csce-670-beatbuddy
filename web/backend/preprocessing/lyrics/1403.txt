Often I am upset
That I cannot fall in love, but I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it
Are you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now but I swear
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here

[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'll cut my hair
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
To make you stare
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'll hide my chest and I'll
Figure out a way to get us out of here

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Turn off your porcelain face
I can't really think right now and this place
Has too many colors, enough to drive all of us insane
Are you dead? Sometimes I think I'm dead
'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My eyes went dark
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't know where
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My pupils are but I'll
Figure out a way to get us out of here

[Verse 3]
Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?
Get a load of this train wreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know, the stars
Welcome him with open arms
Oh

[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Time is
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Slowly
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Tracing his face
But strangely he feels at home in this place83Embed This Is Home This Is Home Cavetown indie-pop
