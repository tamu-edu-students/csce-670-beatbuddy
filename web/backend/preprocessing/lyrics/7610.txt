9 Contributors14 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fourteen and I'm thinkin' 'bout God again
In the back of our car, everyone is so far from me
Seventeen and I'm feelin' so out of place
I've been movin' too much
And lately, I've been runnin' round in circles everyday

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've turned off a part of me
That I can't find anymore
I'm sick of always questioning myself
And what I'm doing wrong

[Chorus]
And I wish I was somebody else
Just to feel like I’m enough for myself
And I've been fightin' with who I am inside my head
And I don't know me anymore

[Verse 2]
Nineteen and I'm gettin' too drunk again
And I'm falling in love with everyone just for a minute
Mmm, twenty and I'm running away from everything
I dropped out of school to end up wakin' on another cold park bench

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've turned off a part of me
That I can't find anymore
I'm sick of always questioning myself
And what I'm doing wrong
You might also like[Chorus]
And I wish I was somebody else
Just to feel like I’m enough for myself
And I've been fightin' with who I am inside my head
And I don't know me anymore
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh) Woah, anymore
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh) Woah

[Outro]
And I wish I was somebody else
Just to feel like I’m enough for myselfEmbed
