21 ContributorsGimme All Your Lovin’ Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got to have a shot
For what you got is, oh, so sweet
You got to make it hot
Like a boomerang, I need a repeat

[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through

[Verse 2]
You got to whip it up
And hit me like a ton of lead
If I blow my top
Will you let it go to your head?

[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through

You got to move it up
And work it like a schoolboy would
Got to pack it up
Baby, work it like a new boy should

[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're throughEmbed
