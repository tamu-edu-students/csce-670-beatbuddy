Took me over to your house to meet your family
Introduced me to them sayin' that you'd marry me
Then you'd look me in the eye and say, "It's just a joke"
Then you'd kiss me and I'd smile, did you even know?
When you'd say that kinda thing, I'd be excited
Got me hopin' maybe one day you would mean it
Always thought I'd only make a fool of someone else
Now you've only gone and made me make one of myself

[Chorus]
I guess that flowers aren't just used for big apologies
I guess I should've been more conscious how you spoke to me
'Cause when we'd fight, you give me space and not communicate
And for a while, I thought that's what I should appreciate
Maybe I was holdin' on to what I thought you were
But when you think too hard, eventually, it starts to hurt
The version of you in my head now I know wasn't true
Young people fall for the wrong people, guess my one was you

[Verse 2]
I was gettin' any flight so we could make it work
You'd ignore me, coulda told me you were seein' her
Kinda hate myself for justifyin' your mistakes
Took a minute, but I had to learn the hard way
Who are you to tell me I can't be heartbroken?
Babe, you had the chance, the door for you was open
If it's what you need to tell yourself to sleep at night
Pretend I haven't found a man who finally treats me right
You might also like[Chorus]
I guess that flowers aren't just used for big apologies
I guess I should've been more conscious how you spoke to me
'Cause when we'd fight, you give me space and not communicate
And for a while, I thought that's what I should appreciate
Maybe I was holdin' on to what I thought you were
But when you think too hard, eventually, it starts to hurt
The version of you in my head now I know wasn't true
Young people fall for the wrong people, guess my one was you

[Outro]
If there's anything I've learned, it's you should watch yourself
If it's hurting you, then leave and go and get some help6Embed Flowers Flowers Lauren Spencer Smith songwriter
