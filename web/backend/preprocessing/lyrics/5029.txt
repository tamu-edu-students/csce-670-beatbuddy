26 ContributorsYou May Be Right Lyrics[Verse 1]
Friday night, I crashed your party
Saturday, I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

[Verse 2]
I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford-Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane
[Chorus]
You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh, but it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
Turn out the lights
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Well remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said, take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while

[Verse 4]
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

[Chorus]
You may be right
I may be crazy
Ho, but it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
[Chorus]
You may be right
I may be crazy
Hey, but it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
Turn out the lights
Aww, don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

[Outro]
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right8Embed You May Be Right Glass Houses Billy Joel piano
