All right, I'll get straight to the point: I found marijuana in the house. And while I never thought of myself as the type of father who'd have to drug test his kids, I'm willing to do just that if that's what it takes to find out who brought a joint into this house

[Lucy]
Dad, I found a joint in Mom's dresser drawer
