What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel...

[Hook]
No one knows, what's done is done
It's as if he were dead

[Verse 2]
I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expression

[Hook]
No one knows, what's done is done
It's as if he were dead
You might also like[Chorus]
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)

[Verse 3]
He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend, just flesh and bone
There's no soul, he sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above

[Hook]
Mad
At God
Mad

[Verse 4]
He as hollow as I converse
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you

[Hook]
My best friend
My best friend
Come back
[Chorus]
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)10Embed Hollow Vulgar Display of Power Pantera groove
