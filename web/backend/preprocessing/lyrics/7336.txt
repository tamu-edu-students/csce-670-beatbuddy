30 ContributorsLeave Before the Lights Come On Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, this is a good idea
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't one
Well, my friend fancies you
Oh, what a way to begin it all
You said, "They're always exciting words to hear"

[Chorus]
And they woke up together not quite realising how
Awkwardly stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning
And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And now there's nothing left to guess now

[Verse 2]
They left before the lights came on
Because they didn't want to ruin what it was that was brewing
Before they absolutely had to
And how can you wake up with someone you don't love
And not feel slightly fazed by it?
Oh, he had a struggle

[Chorus]
And they woke up together not quite realising how
Awkwardly stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning
And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And now there's nothing left to guess now

Well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'Cause then you don't have to see
'Cause then you don't have to see what you've done
Well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'Cause then you don't have to see
'Cause then you don't have to see what you've done

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up16Embed Leave Before The Lights Come On Leave Before The Lights Come On Arctic Monkeys garage
