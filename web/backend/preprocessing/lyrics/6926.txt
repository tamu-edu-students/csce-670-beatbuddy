I know that we haven't met, but I know your vibe
Are we skipping a step? 'Cause I really don't mind
It's like you been in my bed a couple thousand times
Now we're at it again, we're at it again for the very first time

[Verse 1]
Hello, stranger
I don't know your name, but I recognize your energy
A breath-taker
You give me déjà vu, this is feeling like a memory
Yeah, your lips look so familiar
And I don't know if this is real or just the liquor
But this feeling is major
It might sound a little strange 'cause

[Chorus]
I know that we haven't met, but I know your vibe
Are we skipping a step? 'Cause I really don't mind
It's like you've been in my bed a couple thousand times
Now we're at it again, we're at it again
I know that we haven't met, but I know your vibe
Are we skipping a step? 'Cause I really don't mind
It's like you been in my bed a couple thousand times
Now we're at it again, we're at it again for the very first time
You might also like[Drop]
For the very first time
For the very first time

[Verse 2]
Am I being cliché
Saying that you're probably from a dream I had?
I will put you on replay
Yeah, the TV show I'm marathoning all damn weekend
Babe, I can't lie, it kinda creeps me out
How you say what's on my mind before it leaves my mouth
Yeah, it's hard for me to explain
I know it probably sounds strange

[Chorus]
I know that we haven't met, but I know your vibe
Are we skipping a step? 'Cause I really don't mind
It's like you been in my bed a couple thousand times
Now we're at it again, we're at it again
I know that we haven't met, but I know your vibe
Are we skipping a step? 'Cause I really don't mind
It's like you been in my bed a couple thousand times
Now we're at it again, we're at it again for the very first time

[Drop]
For the very first time
For the very first time
[Outro]
We're at it again, we're at it again
We're at it again, again for the very first time
We're at it again, we're at it again
We're at it again, again8Embed
