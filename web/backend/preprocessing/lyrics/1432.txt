I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted, one time, to see you laughing

[Pre-Chorus]
I only want to see you laughing
In the purple rain

[Chorus]
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you bathing
In the purple rain
[Verse 2]
I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend, hey
Baby, I could never steal you from another

[Pre-Chorus]
It's such a shame our friendship had to end

[Chorus]
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you underneath the purple rain

Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out for something new
That means you, too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain

[Chorus]
Purple rain, purple rain, yeah
Purple rain, purple rain, wooo!
If you know what I'm singing about up here
Come on, raise your hand
Purple rain, purple rain, yeah
I only want to see you
Only want to see you in the purple rain
