[Verse 1: Eric Clapton]
Bell bottom blues, you made me cry
I don't want to lose this feeling
And if I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms

[Chorus: Eric Clapton, Eric Clapton & Bobby Whitlock]
Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

[Verse 2: Eric Clapton]
It's all wrong, but it's alright
The way that you treat me baby, mmh
Once I was strong but I lost the fight
You won't find a better loser

[Chorus: Eric Clapton, Eric Clapton & Bobby Whitlock]
Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay
