Oh, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
Somebody's Heine
Is crowding my icebox
Somebody's cold one
Is giving me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes

[Interlude]
Oh, yeah
Alright
Feels good
Inside

[Verse 2]
Flip on the telly
Wrestle with Jimmy
Somethin' is bubblin'
Behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker

I can't confront you
I never could do
That which might hurt you
So try and be cool
When I say
"This way
Is a water slide away from me that takes you further every day"
So be cool

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker

[Bridge]
Dear daddy, I write you
In spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus
Things are good, or so I hear
This bottle of Steven's
Awakens ancient feelin's
Like father, stepfather
The son is drowning in the flood
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker79Embed
