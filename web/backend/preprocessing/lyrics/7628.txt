50 ContributorsDrugs Lyrics[Intro: Ronnie Radke]
'Cause everybody's on drugs

[Verse 1: Ronnie Radke]
Kill yourself is what they said to me
I'm already dead, just differently
They say God is real, I disagree
'Cause if that were true
Then we'd all be free, all be free, ya, ya
Running from something that's killing me
Dealing with such an uncomfortable feeling
Beginning to feel the hostility from my ability
Of slowly becoming the villain
I just wanna thank all my fans especially
Without you is the death of me
I don't consider myself a celebrity
But I'll be doing this shit 'til I'm 70
This is my destiny, this is the best of me
It's an incredible feeling to grow
Letting it go, I'm letting you know
We're killing ourselves on the low

[Pre-Chorus: Ronnie Radke]
Everybody wants some, everybody gets none from me

[Chorus: Ronnie Radke]
'Cause everybody's on drugs
It's hard to believe, the American dream is a killing machine
We're all falling in love with a new disease
If it's killing you, then it's murdering me
It's all getting so unbelievable
We're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun
And you don't see that it's killing you
'Cause everybody's on drugs

Save yourself is what I'm telling you
'Cause nobody else really has a clue
Into your veins, veins, like heroin, -oin
Accept the pain, pain just to feel again, fe- fe- feel again

[Pre-Chorus: Ronnie Radke]
Everybody wants some, everybody gets none from me

[Chorus: Ronnie Radke]
'Cause everybody's on drugs
It's hard to believe, the American dream is a killing machine
We're all falling in love with a new disease
If it's killing you, then it's murdering me
It's all getting so unbelievable
We're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun
And you don't see that it's killing you

[Breakdown: Corey Taylor with Ronnie Radke]
Everybody is dead from the neck up
Tryna keep their heads up, searching for a way out
This is a dying nation, so complacent
Spirits need awakened, what are we waiting for?
Fuck, die
Just die, motherfucker, die, motherfucker, die
[Bridge: Ronnie Radke]
'Cause everybody's on drugs
The American dream is a killing machine
Everybody's on drugs
If it's killing you

[Chorus: Ronnie Radke]
It's so fucking unbelievable
We're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun
And you don't see that it's killing you
'Cause everybody's on drugs

[Outro: Ronnie Radke]
