8 ContributorsOn Repeat Lyrics[Chorus]
Live the life you wanna lead
Spend the same day on repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on repeat
Isolate yourself  from me
Spend the same day on repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on repeat
Keep on floating through a dream
If this is who you wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Find youself afraid to see
On the run from something real, something real, something real

[Pre-Drop]
On rеpeat

[Drop]
On repeat
On rеpeat
On repeat

[Bridge]
But it's you again
Who's always wondering
Where to begin
But it's you again
Who's always wondering
Where to begin
You might also like[Chorus]
Live the life you wanna live
Spend the same day on repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on repeat
Isolate yourself from me
Spend the same day on repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on repeat

[Pre-Drop]
On repeat

[Drop]
On repeat

[Chorus]
Live the life you wanna lead
Spend the same day on repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on repeat
Isolate yourself from me
Spend the same day on repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on repeat
Keep on floating through a dream
If this is who you wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Find youself afraid to see
On the run from something real, something real, something real
