Don't kill me
Just help me run away from everyone
I need a place to stay where I can cover up my face
Don't cry, I am just a freak

[Chorus]
I am just a freak
I am just a freak
I am just a freak

[Verse 2]
My head is filled with parasites
Black holes cover up my eyes
I dream of you almost every night
Hopefully, I won't wake up this time

[Chorus]
I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this timeYou might also like52Embed
