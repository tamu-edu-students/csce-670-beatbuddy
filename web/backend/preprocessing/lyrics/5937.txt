Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

[Verse 1]
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right

[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming
All night long

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
The air's electric, sparking power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

[Outro]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning1Embed
