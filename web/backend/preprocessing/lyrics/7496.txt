17 Contributors​a new moral low ground Lyrics[Intro]
Grit grinding under my teeth
I guess that I can stop if I'm getting you down
I'll keep myself on a leash
If I were born to hang, then I'll never be drowned

[Verse 1]
A feather knocked me down
Oh, what a shame, I was stood in the jaws of defeat
Trying to fight for a new moral low ground
I see the parallels when the sinners are holding the arrows

[Pre-Chorus]
No feeling left, still we're dying to know
But that's the price that you pay for your sorrow

[Chorus]
One love for your enemy
Two steps from the edge of your sanity
Three strikes for the cavalry
You cut me close to the bone
Four walls that you'll never see
Five waits for a taste of humanity
Six feet, what a travesty
You cut me close to the bone

Why don't you stick around?
It's just a game but we live on the edge of the seat
We like that and we ain't easy to talk 'round
We feel the dagger twist when we're faced with the straight and the narrow

[Pre-Chorus]
No feeling left, still we're dying to know
But that's the price that you pay for your sorrow

[Chorus]
One love for your enemy
Two steps from the edge of your sanity
Three strikes for the cavalry
You cut me close to the bone
Four walls that you'll never see
Five waits for a taste of humanity
Six feet, what a travesty
You cut me close to the bone

[Bridge]
You cut me close to the bone
Grit grinding under my teeth
I guess that I can stop if I'm getting you down
I'll keep myself on a leash
If I were born to hang then I'll never be drowned
(I'll never be drowned)
(Grit grinding under my teeth)
(God knows I'm getting you down)
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
One love for your enemy
Two steps from the edge of your sanity
Three strikes for the cavalry
You cut me close to the bone
Four walls that you'll never see
Five waits for a taste of humanity
Six feet, what a travesty
You cut me close to the boneEmbed
