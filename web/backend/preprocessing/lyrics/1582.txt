[Intro]
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya

[Verse 1]
There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
And you became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya

There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey

[Bridge]
I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
I, I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
I've (And if I should fall, will it all go away?) been kissed by a rose on the grey
I, I've been kissed by a rose on the grey

[Verse 2]
There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey
Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya

[Outro]
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey38Embed Kiss from a Rose Seal Seal soul
