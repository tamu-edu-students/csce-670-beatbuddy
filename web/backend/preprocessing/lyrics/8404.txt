6 ContributorsDon’t Go to Strangers LyricsIf I'm standing in a crowd, call my name, call it loud
Don't go to strangers, woman, call on me

Wave your arms in the air, let me know that you're there
When in doubt, oh woman, call on me

Don't leave me here to rust, don't let me turn to dust
Oh, woman, when in doubt, call on me

If I'm standing in a crowd, call my name, call it loud
Don't go to strangers, woman, call on meYou might also like1Embed
