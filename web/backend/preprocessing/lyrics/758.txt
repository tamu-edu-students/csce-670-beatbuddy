Baby, now and then
I think about me now and who I could have been
And then I picture all the perfect that we lived
'Til I cut the strings on your tiny violin, oh woah

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind's got a m-m-mind of its own right now
And it makes me hate me
I'll explode like a dynamite if I can't decide, baby

[Chorus]
My head and my heart are torturing me, yeah
Lost my mind in your arms, I go to extremes, yeah
When angels tell me run, and monsters call it love, oh
My head and my heart are caught in-between, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Tell mе yes or no
Asking the heavеns, "Should I stay or should I go?"
You held my hand when I had nothing left to hold
And now I'm on a roll, oh
Oh woah

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind's got a m-m-mind of its own right now
And it makes me hate me
I'll explode like a dynamite if I can't decide, baby

[Chorus]
My head and my heart are torturing me, yeah
Lost my mind in your arms, I go to extremes, yeah
When angels tell me run, and monsters call it love, oh
My head and my heart are caught in-between, yeah

[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm standin' at the crossroads
I cross my heart with X and O's
Which way leads to forever?
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
God only knows

[Chorus]
My head and my heart are torturing me, yeah
Lost my mind in your arms, I go to extremes, yeah
When angels tell me run, and monsters call it love, oh
My head (My head) and my heart (My heart)
Are caught in-between, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la (Oh)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la (Oh)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la (La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, oh)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la (Oh yeah)
