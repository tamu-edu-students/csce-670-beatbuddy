I say "fuck it" when I feel it
'Cause no one's keepin' tally
I do what I want with who I like
I ain't gon' conceal it
While you talkin' all that shit
I'll be gettin' mine, gettin' mine

[Verse 1: Lisa]
Don't apologize for my behavior
If you're offended, I don't care
Starin' at me 'stead of starin' in the mirror
Little weird how

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo]
Everybody tells me to play nice
Everybody judge, but looking twice
But my body don't belong to, nah-uh-uh, none of them though
And I'm not gonna change 'cause you say so

[Chorus: Jennie, Rosé]
I say "fuck it" when I feel it
'Cause no one's keepin' tally
I do what I want with who I like
I ain't gon' conceal it
While you talkin' all that shit
I'll be gettin' mine, gettin' mine
Yeah, I say "fuck it" when I feel it
'Cause no one's keepin' tally
I do what I want with who I like
And I ain't gon' conceal it
I'll just do it like the boys say
I'm gettin' mine, gettin' mine

Told me to play it cool
I break the rules, I'm breaking hearts in two
Warned me to make the rules
Or play the fool, it ain't that hard to choose
Take apart the dos and don'ts
And lose the won'ts, I'm gettin' mine
Mines is mine, yours is mine
This is mine, get in line

[Verse 3: Jennie]
Sometimes, I like to go play dirty
Just like all of the fuck boys do
That's my choice and there's no one I'm hurting
And that's not girly

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé]
Everybody tells me to play nice
Everybody judge, but lookin' twice
But my body don't belong to, nah-uh-uh, none of them though
And I'm not gonna change 'cause you say so

[Chorus: Jisoo, Lisa]
I say "fuck it" when I feel it
'Cause no one's keepin' tally
I do what I want with who I like
I ain't gon' conceal it
While you talkin' all that shit
I'll be gettin' mine, gettin' mine
Yeah, I say "fuck it" when I feel it
'Cause no one's keepin' tally
I do what I want with who I like
And I ain't gon' conceal it
I'll just do it like the boys say
I'm gettin' mine, gettin' mine
[Outro: Jennie, Rosé]
(Yeah, I say "fuck it" when I feel it)
