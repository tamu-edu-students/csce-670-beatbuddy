47 ContributorsLatest Trends Lyrics[Verse 1: A1OrFundz]
I ain't got time for a ho (They know)
And broski's like the devil 'cause he likes taking people's souls (Haha)
This, this ain't a football drill when we say that we keep them on their toes (On their toes)
My bro came out of the slammer, now I'm screaming, "Fresh home, fresh home"
Now I'm screaming, "Fresh home, fresh home"
Excuse me, miss, can you clap for the NHS?
And darling, if you can't do that, KMT, the disrespect
They talk on my name 'cause they brass and wet
Thеm man are bums, tell 'em go gеt bread
I ain't got time for the stupid gems
I dick that ting then I'm onto the ne-e-ext

[Chorus: A1OrFundz]
You wouldn't know this, but my heart is cold like my home is
Where were you when we could've been homeless?
I can't have a bitch, 'cause I'd probably lose focus
You know, get lost in the moment
I could probably end up heartbroken
I was chasing a bag, you was chasing these hoes
Like I ain't got time to lotion

[Verse 2: A1OrFundz]
I'm tryna get high-igh-igh, I'm tryna reach the sky-y-y
Told her, "Babes, come, we bill it," she said, "Well, not tonight"
DTB for life, married to the money, my wife
DTB for life, married to the money, my wife
I said, "Ooh, come, we catch these yutes"
I don't take L's or lose
And me, I ain't got nothing to prove
I been out here with the goons (Bang, pow, boom)
Bros always itching to shoot
The best response is silence
Why'd you think that I stay on mute?

Got one ting, man, she came from the south
And she wanna hold my spear like Britney
Got one ting, man, she came from east
And she wanna sing for me like Whitney
She wanna have my pickney, don't be silly, don't be silly
I'm out 'ere tryna get this bread in my Nike Tech-Fleece suttin like Adzmilli

[Chorus: A1OrFundz]
You wouldn't know this, but my heart is cold like my home is
Where were you when we could've been homeless?
I can't have a bitch, 'cause I'd probably lose focus
You know, get lost in the moment
I could probably end up heartbroken
I was chasing a bag, you was chasing these hoes
Like I ain't got time to lotion

[Verse 4: J1Mulla]
My bros in the lab like Dexter
And she wanna take this BBC and I ain't talkin' 'bout 1Xtra
Defend my bros like Evra
All my haters hating, I just tell 'em, "Back to sender"
I might bell her in, then put her right back like Héctor
The world's so fucked nowadays, all they do is follow and follow (Facts)
I don't care 'bout the latest trends 'cause I might even die tomorrow
That's why I ain't sleepy like hollow
If I ever win the lotto
I'll share that with my family
And make sure they don't borrow
[Chorus: A1OrFundz]
You wouldn't know this, but my heart is cold like my home is
Where were you when we could've been homeless?
I can't have a bitch, 'cause I'd probably lose focus
You know, get lost in the moment
I could probably end up heartbroken
I was chasing a bag, you was chasing these hoes
Like I ain't got time to lotion

[Outro: A1OrFundz]
I'm tryna get high-igh-igh, I'm tryna reach the sky-y-y
Told her, "Babes, come, we bill it," she said, "Well, not tonight"
