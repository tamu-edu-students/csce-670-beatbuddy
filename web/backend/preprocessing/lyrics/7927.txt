Miler got the pain killer

[Hook]
Yeah, my bad, you mad, gotta watch my back
New shirt, gotta pop my tags
New whip, I'ma ride so fast
I just wanna be somebody that you care about
So everybody else, get 'em out, cut 'em out
Everybody else, get 'em out, cut 'em out
I don't wanna be somebody you don't give a fuck about, yeah
Yeah, run it back, yeah
Met a bad chick, get her on my lap, yeah
I'ma bag this, had to get the snap, yeah
I'm a savage, put her in the back, yeah
Aye, run it back, yeah
Met a bad chick, get her on my lap, yeah
I'ma bag this, had to get the snap, yeah
I'm a savage, put her in the back, yeah

[Verse]
Aye, take it back to the base, ay-eah
Wearing sweatpants with the AC, yeah
I be runnin' laps from the bases, yeah
And I saw you in the back of a Macy's, yeah
And I just had to face it
I knew that I wanted to marry you in a Macy's
Back up in the day, I would probably never say shit
But I never got what I wanted, sitting complacent, yeah
I hate when it all come back to me
Truthful is all you had to be
You hurt me, baby, can't you see
Now I'm sitting like (What?)
Why did the memories come back to me
But I didn't want this, it had to be
Now you know I moved on, you're sad to see, yeah
Aye, now you really only want me for the clout
Say you love me but I kinda got a doubt
'Cause I made it and you know what I'm about
Getting litty and I'm jumping in the crowd
Try to tell me but you didn't make a sound
Take a beat and then I put it in the ground
I'm a dog, you probably put me in a pound
Bitch, I did it for the O
