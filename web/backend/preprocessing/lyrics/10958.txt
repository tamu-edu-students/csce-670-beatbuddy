3 ContributorsMissing Sumthin’ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Think I didn't notice
I try to control me from explodin'
Gotta lose it, can't do this
Like we in a movie
Soon as I get comfortable you wanna
Show me your real self
Out in them heels
Takin' pills, yeah
To deal with my feels
When I talk to God I
Tell him take the wheel
Almost crashed the push to start
Jimmy Choo imprints in my heart

[Chorus]
Yeah, I just want your hug and kisses
But lately I been feelin' I been missin' something
Your body is my only interest, oh
Girl, I just want your hug and kisses (Yeah, yeah)
Girl, I just wanna close the distance
But lately, I've been feelin' I been missing something
Your body is my only interest, yeah
Girl, I just wanna close the distance

[Verse 2]
Can't even go to the grocery store
Without you thinkin' I'm baggin' up hoes
We juxtaposed, you ain't supposed to be
Focused on bitches posted for me...
They all posers, groupie bitches only nosy
You're the one that really know
In and out the real and whole me
I know how you feel inside
And I know that we both sick and tired
You might also like[Chorus]
Ayy, I just want your hug and kisses
But lately I been feelin' I been missin' something
Your body is my only interest, oh
Girl, I just want your hug and kisses (Yeah, yeah)
Girl, I just wanna close the distance
But lately, I've been feelin' I been missing something
Your body is my only interest, yeah
I just wanna close the distanceEmbed
