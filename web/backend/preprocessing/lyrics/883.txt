I tried to reach you, I can't hide
How strong's the feeling when we dive
Across the ocean of my mind
My wounds are healing with the salt
All my senses intensified
Whenever you and I, we dive
Across the ocean of my mind
But in the end, I drown
You pushed me down, down
(You pushed me down, down)
(You pushed me down, down)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
All the shame
When you called my name
I felt pain
When you came
