Black ocean, cold and dark
I am the hungry shark, fast and merciless
But the only girl that could talk to him just couldn't swim
Tell me what's worse than this
And it echoes in the halls
They danced along the walls
The memories of your ghost
You are the one that I used to love
And I'm still in love, but I've never loved you the most

[Chorus 1]
I've seen better days
So unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe, much less believe

[Verse 2]
You gave me everything you had
Every little thing you had
A pure love unrehearsed
I've seen your best and worst
And at your worst, you're still the best
But at my best, I am the worst
It's a curse
Your eyes are lined in pain
Black tears don't hide in rain
And I tied you to the tracks
When I turned around, I heard the sound
I hit the ground, I know there's no turning back
You might also like[Chorus 2]
I've seen better days
So unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe, much less believe the truth
Better days, so unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe, much less believe the truth

[Verse 3]
Black ocean, cold and dark
I am the hungry shark, fast and merciless
But the only girl that could talk to him, she couldn't swim
Tell me what's worse than this
What's worse is all the coke
The ice, it numbs my throat if only for the night
My muscles will contract, your bones will crack
It's just a fact 'cause I am here to win this fight

[Chorus 3]
I can't fucking breathe, much less believe the truth
I pick up a gun, aim for the sun, and shoot
Better days, so unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe or believe the truth

[Outro]
Your eyes are lined in pain
Black tears don't hide in rain
And I tied you to the tracks
When I turned around, I heard that sound45Embed
