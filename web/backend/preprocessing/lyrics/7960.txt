I used to think, darlin', you never did nothin'
But you were always up to somethin'
Always had a run in, yeah
I gotta think those days are comin' to get ya
Now nobody want to protect ya
They only want to forget ya

[Chorus]
You'll be on my mind
Don't give yourself away
To the weight of love
You'll be on your side
Don't give yourself away
The weight of, weight of love

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Dance all night 'cause people, they don't wanna be lonely
Never wanna be lonely
They don't wanna be an only one
You had a thing no one could ever be sure of
Never ever had a pure love
And never no cure from

You'll be on my mind
Don't give yourself away
To the weight of love
You'll be on your side
Don't give yourself away
The weight of, weight of love
