I should've let you know that you're my only one
I know you're feeling numb, I'll fuck you 'til you cum
Said, "I don't understand how you don't got a man"
You want me in your bed 'cause I've been in your head

[Verse]
Baby, you've been up all night, so you don't wanna wait on me
I'm about to catch my flight, so you don't gotta wait on me
No more, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna
I've been up a very long time, wonder why they hate on me
I don't wanna love myself, I'm praying that they all love me
'Cause you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna

[Chorus]
I should've let you know that you're my only one
I know you're feeling numb, I'll fuck you 'til you cum
Said, "I don't understand how you don't got a man"
You want me in your bed 'cause I've been in your head

[Outro]
