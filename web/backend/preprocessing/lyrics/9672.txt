5 ContributorsPerhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps (Quizas, Quizas, Quizas) Lyrics[Verse]
You won't admit you love me
And so, how am I ever, to know
You always tell me
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

[Pre-Chorus]
A million times I've asked you, and then
I ask you over, again
You only answer
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

[Chorus]
If you can't make your mind up
We'll never, get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, brokenhearted

So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't dear, confess
And please don't tell me
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

[Post-Chorus]
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
You might also like[Chorus]
If you can't make your mind up
We'll never, get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, brokenhearted

So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't dear, confess
And please don't tell me
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

[Outro]
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
Perhaps
