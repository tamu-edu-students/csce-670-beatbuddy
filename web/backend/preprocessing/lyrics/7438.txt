3 ContributorsThis Is How I Thank The Lord Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't have enough words
I'll never live enough lifetimes
To fully know Your worth
To know all that You deserve
All of my deceptions
All of my duplicity
Now there is no record
You assume the best of me

[Chorus]
And this is why I thank the Lord for saving me
When I was weak
So I will sing
This is why I thank the Lord for everything
And this is why I thank the Lord

[Verse 2]
All of my affection (Ooh-ooh)
Everything I have to give (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
The sum of my attention (Ooh-ooh)
Is measured in the praise I lift (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
So this is how I thank the Lord for saving me
When I was weak
So I will sing
This is how I thank the Lord for everything
This is how I thank the Lord
Yeah, this is how I thank the Lord for loving me
And keeping me
So I will sing
This is how I thank the Lord for everything
This is how I thank the Lord

'Cause this is how I praise the Lord (Oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]

When I was weak (How I thank the Lord)
So I will sing (This is how I thank the Lord for everything, oh)
