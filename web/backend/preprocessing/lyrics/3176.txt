Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

[Chorus: Elton John & 2Pac]
Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 1]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days (Days)
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays, things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth, 'cause the truth look strange
And for me, it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts (Hurts)
‘Cause any day, they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined
My ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me (Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 2]
Tell me, do you see that old lady, ain't it sad?
Livin' out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady
Crack got her crazy, guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan, we jump into another form of slavery
Even now, I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles (Own bottles)
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy
'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel
[Chorus: Elton John & 2Pac]
Those who wish to follow me (Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Outro]
Lord, can you hear me speak?
