3 ContributorsRock with You (Single Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain’t nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away
Mhm

[Verse 2]
Out on the floor
There ain’t nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away

[Bridge]
And when the groove is dead and gone, yeah
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever on

I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

[Chorus]
I wanna rock (All night) with you, girl (Sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you, yeah (All night)
Dance the night away
I wanna rock with you, yeah (All night)
Rock you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Rock the night away
[Outro]
Feel the heat, feel the beat (All night)
Rock you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock (All night)
Rock the night awayEmbed Rock with You - Single Version Off the Wall Michael Jackson soul
