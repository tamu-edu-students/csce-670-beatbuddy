18 ContributorsTell the Reaper I’m Sorry Lyrics[Chorus]
Save me from misery
Can you save my broken soul?
Save me from misery
Not my time, don't wanna go
Ohh, whoa
Ohh, whoa

[Verse 1]
Yeah, my life is ending, It started drifting away, yeah
The time was given, wasn't able to escape, yeah
A million dollars finally pulled me out the trenches
But all that money starts to eat at your existence (Lone wolf)
You know I've been so damn lost these days
On my own, I got no one to break me out these chains
It's so hard to calm me down before I go insane
I don't wanna be this way
Numbered on my days now

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh, tell the reaper that I'm sorry
I never wanna harm me
But the voice is so alarming
Tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
Save me from misery
Can you save my broken soul?
Save me from misery
Not my time, don't wanna go
Ohh, whoa
Ohh, whoa

And all of the time I gave to fix it all is not enough
Starts to take it's toll
I'm giving up, I'm giving up now
My vision is blurry
I can't break these chains
And I'll be surprised if I make it today
I'm sorry for all of the pain I create
This life isn't worth it, it's not worth the shame

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh, tell the reaper that I'm sorry
I never wanna harm me
But the voice is so alarming
Tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
Save me from misery
Can you save my broken soul?
Save me from misery
Not my time, don't wanna go
Ohh, whoa
Ohh, whoa20Embed
