Well if you ever plan to motor west
Jack take my way, it's the highway that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Verse 2]
Well it winds from Chicago to L.A
More than 2000 miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Bridge]
Well it goes from St Louie, Joplin, Missouri
Oklahoma City looks oh so pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, don't forget Winona
Kingsman, Barstow, San Bernardino

[Verse 3]
Won't you get hip to this kindly tip
Jack and take that California trip?
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Well it goes through St Louie, Joplin, Missouri
Oklahoma City looks ooh so pretty
You'll see Amarillo, Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, don't forget Winona
Kingsman, Barstow, San Bernardino

Won't you get hip to that kindly tip
Jack and take that California trip?
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Outro]
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 663Embed
