17 ContributorsRepeat Until Death Lyrics[Verse 1]
Low, a part of me now
A palm to my mouth
I said it almost
Snow, brother, I'll bet it all gold
Shudder with blood in my nose
I had it almost

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Don't go, you're half of me now
But I'm hardly stood proud
I said it almost

[Bridge]
Oh, I've been low
But damn it, I bet it don't show
It was heaven a moment ago
Oh, I had it almost
We had it almost

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Oh, I can't seem to let myself leave you
But I can't breathe anymore
Oh, I can't seem to not need to need you
And I can't breathe anymoreSee Novo Amor LiveGet tickets as low as $43You might also like2Embed
