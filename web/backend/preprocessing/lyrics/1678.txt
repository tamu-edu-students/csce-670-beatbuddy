I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine
But Mama said

[Chorus]
"You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take" (Can't wait)
"You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes"

[Verse 1]
But how many heartaches
Must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again?
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, is almost gone
I remember Mama said
You might also like[Chorus]
"(You can't hurry love)
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take" (Can't wait)
How long must I wait? (Ooh, until that day)
How much more can I take
Before loneliness (Love don't come easy)
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

[Verse 2]
No I can't bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I can't go on
These precious words
Keeps me hangin' on
I remember Mama said

[Chorus]
"(You can't hurry love)
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take" (Can't wait)
"You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait" (Ooh, until that day)
She said, "Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes"
(Now break!)
[Verse 3]
No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight

[Chorus]
I keep waiting (Can't wait, ooh, until that day)
I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy (Love don't come easy)
It ain't easy, but Mama said
"You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes"
"You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy"3Embed You Can't Hurry Love The Supremes A' Go-Go (Expanded Edition) The Supremes disco
