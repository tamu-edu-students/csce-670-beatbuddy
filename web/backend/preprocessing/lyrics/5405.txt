Woah, ooh
Oh, oh-oh, woah
Oh

[Verse 1]
He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on, but no one's home
She's so vacant, her soul is taken
He thinks, "What's she running from?"

[Chorus]
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies

[Verse 2]
Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be

[Chorus]
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies

So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her, it never dies
So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies20Embed He Can Only Hold Her Back To Black (Deluxe Edition) Amy Winehouse british
