55 ContributorsALL GIRLS ARE THE SAME Lyrics[Intro: PrivateFuneral, RØNIN & PrivateFuneral]
Valentine in December
You say you love me, but you don't remember
My name, you cause me pain
All girls are the same in the end

[Chorus: RØNIN]
I don’t love you now
All girls are the same
I don't need you now
All girls are the same

[Post-Chorus: RØNIN]
All of these demons, they're dancin’ inside
I don't know whether to live or to die
But I keep fighting that feeling inside
I'm gonna ride, gonna ride till I die
Sorry my homies I left to the side
Do you ever think of suicide?
Fuck with this pain you can see in my eyes
You're fucking around, you gon' pay with your life

[Pre-Chorus: PrivateFuneral, RØNIN & PrivateFuneral]
