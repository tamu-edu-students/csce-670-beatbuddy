Uh, huh-huh
Oh yeah
Work

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me
"Boy, everything she wants, is everything she sees"
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, baby
And now we're six months older
And everything you want, and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
La, la, la, la-la
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
La, la, la, la-la

[Chorus: George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley]
Somebody tell me, oh (Won't you tell me?)
Why I work so hard for you?
(Give you money, work to give you money, oh)

[Verse 2]
Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take
Well, you've shown me you can take, you've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further, and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Then how can it be good enough for two?

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
I can't work any harder than I do (La, la, la, la-la)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
La, la, la, la-la

[Chorus: George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley]
Somebody tell me, oh (Won't you tell me?)
Why I work so hard for you?
(Give you money) All to give you money, oh
[Bridge]
Oh, why do, I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you (La, la, la, la-la)
Won't you tell me?
Give you money, work to give you money, oh
Work, work
Work, work

[Pre-Chorus]
La, la, la, la-la
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
La, la, la, la-la

[Chorus]
Somebody tell me, oh (Won't you tell me?)
Why I work so hard for you?
(Give you money) All to give you money, oh
Somebody tell me (Won't you tell me?)
Why I work so hard for you?
(Give you money) All to give you money (La, la, la, la-la)
Somebody tell me (Won't you tell me?)
(Won't you tell me?) Oh please, tell me
Why I do the things that I do?
(Give you money, work to give you money)12Embed Everything She Wants Make It Big Wham! synth-pop
