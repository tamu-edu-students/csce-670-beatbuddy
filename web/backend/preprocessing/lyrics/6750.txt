1 ContributorBlossom Lyrics[Intro]
Mother nature is truly amazing
What it can do
And it resembles you
Each date it's a special occasion
All the tulips and lily's
So you can stay with me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could stay here forever
But you got better things to do
I won't be complete without you, yeah
Six words I say because it's true, yeah
Told you that there won't be one moment
Without you on my mind
It's your heart I gotta find

[Chorus]
'Cause every time you smile flowers blossom
Got me thinkin' "I love you, I love you"
'Cause you're so awesome
Follow me through the rain
And let's shelter beneath the flowers
I cannot live without you, without you
So let's spend hours
Spending hours together with nature forever now

She is so fine, yeah
And lovin' got me outta my mind, yeah
Got me thinking 'bout her every other time
You're the treasure that my love's gotta find
Follow me I know that you wanna (wanna)
Chill with me around the sunflowers (flower)
Kiss me underneath rain shower (love me)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could stay here forever
But you got better things to do
I won't be complete without you, yeah
Six words I say because it's true, yeah
I told you that there won't be one moment
Without you on my mind
It's your heart I gotta find

[Chorus]
'Cause every time you smile flowers blossom
Got me thinkin' "I love you, I love you"
'Cause you're so awesome
Follow me through the rain
And let's shelter beneath the flowers
I cannot live without you, without you
So let's spend hours
Spending hours together with nature forever now
