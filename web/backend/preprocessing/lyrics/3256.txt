33 ContributorsAdderall Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Shallow graves and deepest fears
No one tells me why I'm here
Leather straps on stapled eyes
Gotta scream to cut your ties
Can't subtract from Adderall
Pull you in before you fall
Not as sweet as it appears
Someone, tell me why I'm here

[Chorus]
Ooh, you know I'm gone
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Ooh, you go, I'm onto you now

[Verse 2]
All they want is your control (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
For the Bible scares me so (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Smell the ones that came here last (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Must've lost the game too fast (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
We don't read bеtween the lines (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Cut too deep to see the signs (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Watch mе as my blood runs cold (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Now your Bible can take hold (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaaah)

Ooh, you know I'm gone
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Which side do I want to be?
This side's got a hold on me
Don't try this home for me now
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
(Slide away from thoughts and prayers the easy way)
Which side do I want to be?
This side's got a hold on me
Don't try this home for me now
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
(Slide away from thoughts and prayers the easy way)
[Chorus]
Ooh, you go, I'm onto you now
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Ooh, you go, I'm onto you now
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)3Embed
