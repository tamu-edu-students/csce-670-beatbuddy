Yeah
So come on and chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
Check (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
You better check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
'Cause I'm bad for your health
I come real stealth
Dropping bombs on your moms
Fuck car alarms
Doing foul crime
I'm that nigga wit'cha Alpine
Sold it for a six-o, always let tricks know
And friends know we got the indo
No, I'm not a sucker sitting in a House of Pain
And no, I'm not the butler, I'll cut ya
Head-butt ya, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, punk motherfucker
Here to let you know, boy, oh boy
I make dough, but don't call me Doughboy
This ain't no fucking motion picture
A guy or bitch-a, my nigga get wit' cha
And hit you, taking that yak to the neck
So you better run a check

Tricks wanna step to Cube and then they get played
'Cause they bitchmade, pulling out a switchblade
That's kinda trifle 'cause that's a knife, ho
AK-47, assault rifle
Hold the fifty, I'm nifty, pow
I got a new style (Watch out now)
I hate motherfuckers claiming that they folding bank
But steady talking shit in the holding tank
First, you wanna step to me?
Now your ass screaming for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row
Now they runnin' up in you slow
You're gone, used to be the Don Juan
Now your name is just Twan
Switchin', snappin', rollin' your eyes and neck
You better run a check

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate

Instead of a tre-eight slug to your cranium (Pow!)
I got six and I'm aimin' em
Will I buss or keep you guessing?
'Cause fuck you and that shit you're stressing
Bitch, get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighborhood hooker
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Giving up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop the coochie and you dead
The bitch is a Miami Hurricane head
Sprung, niggas call her 'Lips & Lungs'
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out
'Cause women like you gets no respect
Bitch, you better run a check
