First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 3]
I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
"I'ma need my shirt back" (Nigga, you know how it go)
[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

[Pre-Chorus]
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow
She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), yeah, ayy
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), haha
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow
She shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
