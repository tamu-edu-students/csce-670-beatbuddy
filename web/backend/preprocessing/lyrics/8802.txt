12 ContributorsGo Wild LyricsThis shit ain't happen by accident
Called up my mom hope she see that it's happening
Hope she can see why I bet on this rappin' shit
Bitch I done woke but ain't sleep on no mattresses'

Hop on my phone just to see where the atlas is
Hop out my zone if you think you go match this shit
Bitch I been grown you can tell by the passion and
I know my home town ain't want me to snap like this (yuh)

Bitch I got fans you ain't gotta Acknowledge it
Play with my bands they should Put me on scholarship
Lately been on my Margielaa and Rocky shit
I whip the tundra like that shit a rocket ship

Some say it's arrogance mixing with cockiness
Don't get it twisted That just be my confidence
Guess we the same if you wonder who stoppin' this
Shawty go suck me that's why on top of this

Ye

Top of my game
Walk all that talk and you won't be the same
Look in my eyes if you want to know bout pain
I just took all they lies and it went to my brain
You might also likeAnd I'm sure he'll be fine
That's what they say
Say I got time
But yo what's on my plate

I just turned 20 but feel like I'm late
And they brush that shit off but
Don't know what's at stake

Yo I'm tryna be the greater than greatest and not just one of the best
And I'm talking better than Bettis like when he fucked up the jets
I'm stacking lettuce on lettuce until that shit got me stressed
Then I might fuck up the senate if there's still a capital left

And It's like

Who? what? when?
Who you really know
When it all falls down
Rain sleet snow

What's a life offline when this thing blow?
What's a life like mine?

Shit you ain't even know…

I don't wanna wait no more now
I been on a wave but it's fourth down
They don't know a thing that they talking bout

Go wild
Go wild

I don't wanna wait no more now
I been on a wave but it's fourth down

They don't know ..
They don't know ..

I don't wanna wait no more now
I been on a wave but it's fourth down
They don't know a thing that they talking 'bout

Go wild
Go wild

I don't wanna wait no more now
I been on a wave but it's fourth down
They don't know ..
They don't know ..1Embed Go Wild Go Wild Drex Carter emo
