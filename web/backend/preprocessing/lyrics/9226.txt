He'd trade his guns for love
But he's caught in the crossfire
And he keeps wakin' up
But it's not to the sound of birds
The tyranny
The violent streets
Deprived of all that we're blessed with
And we can't get enough, no

[Chorus]
Heaven, if you sent us down
So we can build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we've made
I hope you got some beds around
'Cause you're the only refuge now
For every mother, every child, every brother
That's caught in the crossfi—
That's caught in the crossfire

[Verse 2]
I'd trade my luck to know
Why he's caught in the crossfire
And I'm here wakin' up
To the sun and the sound of birds
Society's
Anxiety
Deprived of all that we're blessed with
We just can't get enough, no
You might also like[Chorus]
Heaven, if you sent us down
So we can build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we've made
I hope you got some beds around
'Cause you're the only refuge now
For every mother, every child, every brother
That's caught in the crossfi—
That's caught in the crossfire

[Bridge]
Can I trust what I'm given?
When faith still needs a gun
Whose ammunition
Justifies the wrong?
And I can't see from the backseat
So I'm askin' from above
Can I trust what I'm given
Even when it cuts?

[Chorus]
So heaven, if you sent us down
So we can build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we've made
I hope you got some beds around
'Cause you're the only refuge now
For every mother and every child, every brother
That's caught in the crossfire (Woo)
That's caught in the crossfire (Hey, yeah)
[Outro]
Who's caught in the crossfire? (Ah, oh)
Who's caught in the crossfire? Baby, baby, oh
Who's caught on the cross?65Embed Crossfire Crossfire Stephen indie-pop
