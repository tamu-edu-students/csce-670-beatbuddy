Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Eh

[Verse 1]
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

[Chorus]
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

I always hear, always hear them talkin'
Talkin' 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Sayin' that I hurt you, but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could've really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinkin' 'bout you
It's a shame (Shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

[Chorus]
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
[Bridge]
You got yourself in a dangerous zone
'Cause we both have the fear, fear of bein' alone
And I still don't understand it (Ah)
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
And my heart don't understand it (Ah)
Understand it, understand it (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
Why I got you on my mind (Ah-ah)
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Why I got you on my mind (Ah-ah)
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind (Oh)
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Why I got you on my mind (Ah-ah)
[Post-Chorus]
You think you know somebody
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah)45Embed
