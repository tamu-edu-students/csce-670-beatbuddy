You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin'
You just fade away

[Chorus]
Don't you know I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now
You might also like[Chorus]
You know I'm still standin' better than I ever did
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)16Embed I'm Still Standing Too Low For Zero Elton John piano
