Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Trouble been dogging my soul since the day I was born

Worry
Worry, worry, worry, worry
Worry just will not seem to leave my mind alone

[Chorus]
Well, I've been
Saved by a woman
I've been
Saved by a woman
I've been
Saved by a woman
She won't let me go
She won't let me go, no
She won't let me go, no, no...

[Verse 1]
Trouble
Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Feels like every time I get back on my feet she come around and knock me down again

Worry
Oh, worry, worry, worry, worry
Sometimes I swear it feels like this worry
Is my only friend
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, I've been
Saved by a woman
I've been
Saved by a woman
I've been
Saved by a woman
She won't let me go
She won't let me go, no
She won't let me go, no, no...

[Bridge]
Oh, ah
Oh, ah
She good to me now
She give me love and affection
Say, she good to me now
She give me love and affection

I said I love her
Yes, I love her
I said I love her
I said I love

She good to me now
She good to me
She good to me2Embed
