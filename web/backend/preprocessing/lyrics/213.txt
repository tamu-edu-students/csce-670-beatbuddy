I got a man, but I want you
I got a man, but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you
And you're right

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
You right, I
Got my guy
But I, I
Can't help it, I want you
Said you right, I
Got my guy
But I, I
Can't help it, I want you

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
I can't stop and look the other way
'Cause I know what could be, babe
And you never feel the same
You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairytales
But we got our fantasies
And it's me and you, no she
Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me
Actin' like it's not that deep
Oh, you could take it out on me
Tell me what it's 'bout to be
Really feel it's bound to bе
I can't tell no one, but they all know

I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you
And you're right

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Girl, I want you like you want me too
I feel that energy (Oh yeah)
When you're on top of me (Oh yeah)
I know your man, he ain't controllin' you
But you still hesitate (Oh)
'Cause you choose loyalty (Oh yeah)
And I know your history (Hey)
Met him before your peak (Hey)
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in, then you'll belong to me
