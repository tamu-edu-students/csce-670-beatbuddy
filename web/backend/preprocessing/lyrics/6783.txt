5 ContributorsScargazer Lyrics[Intro: Sample]
I love you
You love me, huh?
Alright
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Pre-Chorus]
Fly me to, fly me to
Fly me to the moon, I'll dance among the stars (I love you)
Fly me to, fly me to
Fly me to the moon, I'll dance among the stars

[Chorus]
Yuh, can I fly you to the moon?
Can we play among the stars?
I've been thinking of you lately
Took control over my heart
You say that you needed space
Atmosphere was in my arms
When I look up at your face
The reflection shows the scars
So I'll fly you to the moon
Where we float among the stars
Darkest ocean ever known
But the lights come from a far
I wish this would never end
I've been trying to pretend
Somethings wrong and it's within
The reflection seems to win
You might also like[Verse]
Why'd you leave me?
Why'd I say no?
Sometimes our mistakes
Open up our souls
Really lost myself
Yet I didn't know
All these thoughts, all these marks really took a toll and
Somethin been buggin' me but I won't say it
I've got a tendency, feeling so vacant
All of these memories being adjacent
You were the one I shoved in the pavement
I pushed you away by hating myself
Feeling so strange, don't know how it felt
Thought I was good, but faltered my health
It wasn't you, I was stuck in my cell

[Pre-Chorus]
Fly me to, fly me to
Fly me to the moon, I'll dance among the stars
Fly me to, fly me to
Fly me to the moon, I'll dance among the stars

[Bridge: Sample]
You need to forgive yourself
I Can't
[Chorus]
Can I fly you to the moon?
Can we play among the stars?
I've been thinking of you lately
Took control over my heart
You say that you needed space
Atmosphere was in my arms
When I look up at your face
The reflection shows the scars
So I'll fly you to the moon
Where we float among the stars
Darkest ocean ever known
But the lights come from a far
I wish this would never end
I've been trying to pretend
Somethings wrong and it's within
The reflection seems to win

[Outro: Sample]
