Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

[Chorus]
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills

[Verse 2]
Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
Cause I'm the next big thing in
See Weezer LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like[Chorus]
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
The truth is
I don't stand a chance
It's something that you're born into
And I just don't belong

[Verse 3]
No I don't, I'm just a no class, beat down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

[Chorus]
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
[Outro]
