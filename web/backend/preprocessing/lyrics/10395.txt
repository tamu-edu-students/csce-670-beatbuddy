11 ContributorsThe Boxer Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles
Such are promises, all lies and jests
Still the man he hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

[Verse 2]
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway stations
Running scared, laying low
Seeking out the poor quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

[Chorus]
Lie-la-lie, lie-la-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie, la-la-la-la-lie

[Verse 3]
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job, but I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
You might also like[Verse 4]
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was home, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home

[Chorus]
La-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminder
Of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
"I am leaving, I am leaving"
But the fighter still remains

[Chorus]
Lie-la-lie, lie-la-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie, la-la-la-la-lie
Lie-la-lie, lie-la-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie, la-la-la-la-lie
Lie-la-lie, lie-la-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie, la-la-la-la-lie
