126 ContributorsAbove the Clouds Lyrics[Intro]
"It has come to our attention
That a mysterious force is loose somewhere in outer space"
"The mysteries of creation are there"
"Up in the sky?" "Up in the sky"
"The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore, as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous
And greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked"
"Prepared for lift off"

[Verse 1: Guru]
I-Self-Lord-And-Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mind power shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the Father and Mother Earth
Seekin' everlastin' life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look, listen and observe
And watch another C-Cipher pullin' my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin' a desert to a well
Experience — the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers
Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck, plus the DJ you respect
The seven-and-a-half combined, over the front line
The ten-percenters promotin' slander in their airtime
Bear in mind, jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp blades, heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds rainin' down, holdin' it down

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah! I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge, shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like Ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Colossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts on my life, so who to trust?
Who but us to supply ya with the fire?
The burnin' truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notify families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo 'cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn! We come rumblin' through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin'
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect in the world, we could've conquered it
[Hook: Guru]
Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds rainin' down, holdin' it down
Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds rainin' down, holdin' it down60Embed Above The Clouds Moment Of Truth Gang Starr;Inspectah Deck hardcore
