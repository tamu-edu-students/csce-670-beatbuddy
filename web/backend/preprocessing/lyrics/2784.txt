22 ContributorsPainkiller Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know you need a fix when you fall down
You know you need to find a way
To get you through another day
Let me be the one to numb you out
Let me be the one to hold you
Never gonna let you get away

[Pre-Chorus]
The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

[Chorus]
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me 'til it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

[Verse 2]
I know what you want so desperately
You know I'll give you one for free
Forever you're comin' back to me
Now I'm gonna give you what you need
'Cause I know what you feed on
And what you lean on, and what you lean on
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

[Chorus]
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me 'til it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

[Bridge]
Did you find another cure?
Did you find another cure?

[Chorus]
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me 'til it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
