Mary had a little lamb
His fleece was white as snow
Everywhere that child went
Your little lamb was sure to go

[Verse 2]
He followed her to school one day
And broke the teacher's rule
What a time did they have
That day at school

[Verse 3]
Tisket tasket baby
A green and yellow basket
Sent a letter to my baby
On my way I passed itYou might also likeEmbed
