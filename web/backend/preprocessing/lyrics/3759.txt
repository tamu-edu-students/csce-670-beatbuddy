Baby I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing 'cause finally it's real

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tryna hold back, you oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you

[Chorus]
You're the right time at the right moment
You're the sunlight, keeps my heart going, woah
Know when I'm with you can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you

[Verse 2]
Baby I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of
And if I can break enough to show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have, girl, just for you

You're the sunlight, keeps my heart going, oh-woah
Know when I'm with you, I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment

[Bridge]
Every night in my bed I'm dreaming
That it's you in my arms I'm holding
Girl, all I want is you
You know you're the right time at the right moment
You're the sunlight, keeps my heart going
It's you, you, you, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the right time at the right moment
You're the sunlight keeps my heart going
Know when I'm with you, I can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you
[Outro]

You, it's you
