2 ContributorsGot You On My Mind LyricsOh I said it one, two times
One day we’ll be fine
And maybe we should just let it be
So I said it two, three times
It’ll be alright
And maybe it is just what I see

Everytime I’m falling it will come to an end
But I’m just gonna love you ‘cause I can not pretend
Know I should stop calling, but I am who I am
Better safe than sorry, hope you’ll understand

Ever since you were passing by
I got you on my mind
I need you all the time
Ever since you were passing by
I got you on my mind
I feel it all the time

Oh I said it one, two times
One day we’ll be fine
And maybe we should just let it be
So I said it two, three times
It’ll be alright
And maybe it is just what I see

Ever since you were passing by
I got you on my mind
I need you all the time
Ever since you were passing by
I got you on my mind
I feel it all the time

Ever since you were passing by
I got you on my mind
I need you all the time
Ever since you were passing by
I got you on my mind
I feel it all the timeEmbed
