Leave me alone, I wanna go home, it's
All in my head, I won't be upset if
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
It's all in my head, I won't be upset if
Heartbroken, misspoken, breaking anything I touch
I'm not in love, I won't let you control what I want

[Chorus]
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love

[Bridge]
Hey you, hey you, you won't hate enough
Hey you, you, why? You, you, you

[Chorus]
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I loveYou might also like112Embed
