Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down
But baby, baby, I don't need no jewels in my crown
'Cause all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
But baby, I go crazy, there's fever in the funk house now
This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a-itchin'
You know you know the deuce is still wild

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't stay, you got to roll me
And call me the tumbling dice

[Verse 2]
Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Don't see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money
I'm all sixes and sevens and nines
Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling
Roll me and call me the tumbling dice
Baby, oh my

Oh, my, my, my, I'm the lone craps shooter
Playing the field every night

[Outro]
Baby, get it straight
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling dice
Got to roll me (Call me the tumbling dice)
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me (Oh, oh yeah)
Got to roll me (Oh, oh)
Got to roll me (Oh yeah)
Got to roll me (Oh, keep on rolling)
Got to roll me (Oh, keep on rolling)
Got to roll me (Oh yeah, keep on rolling)
Got to roll me (Call me the tumbling dice)
Got to roll me (Yeah)
Got to roll me (Roll me, baby)
Got to roll me (Ah yeah)
Got to roll me (Oh my, my, my, my)
Got to roll me
Got to roll me (Keep on tumbling down, baby, oh)
