I am doll eyes, doll mouth, doll legs
I am doll arms, big veins, dog bait

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, they really do
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, and I do too

[Chorus]
I want to be the girl with the most cake
I love him so much, it just turns to hate
I fake it so real, I am beyond fake
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
Someday you will ache like I ache

[Verse 2]
I am doll parts, bad skin, doll heart
It stands for ‘knife’ for the rest of my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, they really do
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, but I do too

I want to be the girl with the most cake
He only loves those things because he loves to see them break
I fake it so real, I am beyond fake
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
Someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
