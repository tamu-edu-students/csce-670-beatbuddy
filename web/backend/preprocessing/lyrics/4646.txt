21 ContributorsStrongest (Alan Walker Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You sit there with that look on your face like you won
Like nothing that I say is gonna change how you feel now
You sit there and you tell me you fell outta love
And we are in your way so you just gotta leave now
And we just need to understand your reasons
And you are gonna justify this treason
By telling me the promises that we sworn ain't enough

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you gonna be another person?
And how do I explain this shit to our son?
How'd you tell a toddler about a girlfriend?
Daddy's gone

[Chorus]
Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone

[Verse 2]
You sit there with your phone in your hands and you're hurt
You tell me that you feel like you lost me when he came
I'm sorry but I cannot connect with your words
'Cause right now what matters isn't yours but it is his name
And we just need to find another income
'Cause she wants you to help her with her own one
And you want me to tell me that what you've done is okay
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So now you gonna be another father?
And I will be a different kind of mother?
And you'd tell a toddler 'bout step brothers?
Daddy's strayed

[Chorus]
Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone

[Bridge]
Let's talk about family
Let's talk about family
Let's talk of the ties and the lies
And the love that we had in this family
Let's talk about honesty
You know nothing about honesty
I'll let go of your hands and our plans
And the chance that we had with this family

[Chorus]
Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone
Alone
We'll leave you alone
We'll leave you alone8Embed Strongest (Alan Walker Remix) Strongest (Alan Walker Remix) Ina Wroldsen;Alan Walker house
