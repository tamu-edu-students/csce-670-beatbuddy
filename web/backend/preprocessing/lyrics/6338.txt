Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

[Verse 1]
I know she told you
Honey I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did
But all I know is that she left you
And you swear that you just don't know why
But you know, honey I'll always
I'll always be around if you ever want me

[Chorus]
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

[Verse 2]
Don't you know, honey
Ain't nobody ever going to love you
The way I try to do?
Who'll take all your pain
Honey, your heartache, too?
And if you need me, you know
That I'll always be around if you ever want me
You might also like[Chorus]
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

[Verse 3]
And when you walk around the world, babe
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road
You might find out later that the road will end in Detroit
Honey, the road will even end in Kathmandu
You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby
When you only got to do one thing well
You only got to do one thing well to make it in this world, babe
You got a woman waiting for you there
All you ever got to do is be a good man one time to one woman
And that will be the end of the road, babe
I know you got more tears to share, babe

[Chorus]
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

[Bridge]
And if you ever feel a little lonely, dear
I want you to come on, come on to your mama now
And if you ever want a little love of a woman
[Chorus]
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home5Embed
