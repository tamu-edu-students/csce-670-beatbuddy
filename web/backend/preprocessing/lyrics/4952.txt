15 ContributorsEye of the Storm Lyrics*whistling and background thunder sounds*

I
Am the eye of the storm
Inside
I am silent and strong
Just waitin for the right (right) moment to strike
Coiled like a cobra

I! oh-oh-oh-oh-oh(x3)
I am the eye of the storm

Wind (wind) howling in my face
Tearing up the asphalt
Imma getting up in my place
Run (run) nowhere left to hide
I must take a stand now
Find the strength inside!

Wel-come to the vortex
Absolute ground zero of my heart
Pi-ni-cle of the apex
Nothin's gonna tear my soul apart

I
Am the eye of the storm
Inside
I am silent and strong
Just waitin for the right (right) moment to strike
Coiled like a cobra coming to life
You might also likeI
Am the eye of the storm
Inside
I am silent and strong
Just waitin for the moment
Never see me coming

I oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (x3)
I am the eye of the storm

I oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (x3)
I am the eye of the storm

Pain (pain) trying to make me break
But I'm like a fortress
Nothing can Penetrate

When it gets hard I don't even flinch
Fear is not a factor
I won't give'em an inch

Wel-come to the vortex
Absolute ground zero of my heart
Pi-ni-cle of the apex
Nothin's gonna tear my soul apart
I
Am the eye of the storm
Inside
I'm silent and strong
Just waitin for the right (right) moment to strike
Coiled like a cobra coming to life

I
Am the eye of the storm
Inside
I am silent and strong
Just waitin for the moment
Never see me coming

I! oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (x3)
I Am the eye of the storm

Storm clouds storm-ing
(This is your)
Final warn-ing

I
Am the eye of the storm
Inside
I am silent and strong
Just waitin for the right (right) moment to strike
Coiled like a cobra coming to life
I
Am the eye of the storm
Inside
I am silent and strong
Just waitin for the moment
Never see me coming

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

I am waiting for the moment
Never see me coming

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

I'm just waiting for the moment
Never see me coming
