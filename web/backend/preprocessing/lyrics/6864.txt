You can dance
Every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight

You can smile
Every smile for the man
Who held your hand
'Neath the pale moonlight

[Chorus]
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm

[Verse 2]
Oh, I know (Oh, I know)
That the music's fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun

Laugh and sing (Yes, I know)
But while we're apart
Don't give your heart
To anyone

But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm

[Bridge]
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh, so much

[Verse 2]
You can dance (You can dance)
Go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go

If he asks (You can dance)
If you're all alone
Can he take you home
You must tell him no

[Chorus]
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm

[Outro]
Save the last dance for me, mmm
