24 ContributorsDrinking From The Bottle Lyrics[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I-I-I-I could pay for everything that's on you (Yeah)
So everything is on me (Woo)
Got them girls going Cyndi Lauper
Gaga and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk, then you in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy? You're on the wrong beach
Tell the bar that we don't want no glass, just bottles
And I'm buying everybody one each

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I was done with staying, getting it wrong (Yeah)
Then everything is alright (Woo)
Got them girls going Heidi Klum
The Kardashians, Rihanna, all types
If you ain't lean, then you in the wrong scene
If you ain't high, then you're not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need no sparklers or nothin'
Just keep the bottles coming all night

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle
[Drop]
We're drinking from the bottle

[Build]
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
The next top model, the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
The next top model, the next top model
The next top, next top
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle
