8 ContributorsBOY IN BLUE Lyrics[Intro]
I been sleeping all day with the lights on
I still hope you're okay on your nights out
I still think you look flames in your nightgown
Said that things'd never change
Look at right now

[Verse 1]
Who's the boy in blue?
What's he know 'bout you?
He got them chucks on, Levi's, white tee
Boy, that's cool
Who's the boy in blue?
What's he know 'bout you?
She said he's from way back
Lost touch just after school
I
Can't remember my lines
It's
Something different every night with you
I swear
I
Thought you gonna be nice
I'm
Really tryna be kind to you
I swear
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm running, running round
You're tryna put me down
You never make a sound
But I need you now

I'm running, running round
You're tryna put me down
You never make a sound
But I need you now

[Chorus]
I been sleeping all day with the lights on
I still hope you're okay on your nights out
I still think you look flames in your nightgown
Said that things'd never change
Look at right now

[Refrain]
Do you still call my name?
Do you still think I'm lame?
Do you look outside your windows and
Think of me when it rains?
Am I something you claimed?
Like things never change?
I hope you're okay
I hope you're okay
I hope you're okay
[Bridge]
I hope you're okay
I hope you're okay
I hope you're okay

[Verse 2]
Baby you're so cool
Like the way you dress
Throwing glitter up
Let's have fucking sex
Text me your address
I'll be gone in ten
That shit make you really second-guess
Who I really am, yuh

[Chorus]
I been sleeping all day with the lights on
I still hope you're okay on your nights out
I still think you look flames in your nightgown
Said that things'd never change
Look at right now

[Refrain]
Do you still call my name?
Do you still think I'm lame?
Do you look outside your windows and
Think of me when it rains?
Am I something you claimed?
Like things never change?
I hope you're okay
I hope you're okay
I hope you're okayEmbed
