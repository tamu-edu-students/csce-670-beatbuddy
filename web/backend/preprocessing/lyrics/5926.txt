8 ContributorsI Hate Everything Lyrics[Intro: Action Bronson]
No, I don't want that
I don't like that

[Verse: Action Bronson & Samples]
Been around the world, I'm not impressed
(I'm not impressed)
I've been around the world, I'm not impressed
Three Michelin stars, I'm not impressed
(I'm not impressed)
I hate everything (Uh)
I'm the food villain (Uh, err)
Alchemist (Err)
The food villain (Err, err)
(Motherfucker) (Err)
Got me a ride or die bitch like Magic Johnson's wife
I wish my parents named me Constantine (Yes)
Found out Johnny got left in a dumpster, it wasn't a shock to me
(Not to me)
(It's unbelievable) (Al, you heard what he just said?)
I never was on a soccer team (Never)
One time, I swear (Fuck)
And I ended that quickly (I hate everything)
I ended it quickly
It's the food villain (Food villain)
They never let me play
No, I don't want that
