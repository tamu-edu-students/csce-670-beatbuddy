2 ContributorsIf You Met Me First Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why do you look at me like that?
Your eyes saying things that they can't take back
Feels good, feels right, it don’t help

[Verse 2]
Every night when the quiet gets loud
Hate that I know what you're doin' right now
Your arms around someone else

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time I’m next to you
I swear that you can feel it too
How long can we do this to ourselves?

[Chorus]
In a different place and time
Maybe in another life
I'll bet that baby you and I would have worked
We never get the chance to try
And what makes it worse
Is you would have loved me
If you met me first

[Verse 3]
I can't even count all the times I've thought
About the line I'd never cross
But I've crossed that line in my head
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't steal you from somebody else
Just to have you to myself
My heart don't wanna hear me tell the truth

[Chorus]
In a different place and time
Maybe in another life
I’ll bet that baby you and I would have worked
We never get the chance to try
And what makes it worse
Is you would have loved me
If you met me first

[Bridge]
I’m not hangin' on to hope
If you do or if you don’t
I don't ever wanna know for sure

[Chorus]
In a different place and time
Maybe in another life
I'll bet that baby you and I would have worked
We never get the chance to try
And what makes it worse
Is you would have loved me
If you met me first
[Outro]
'Cause you would have loved me
If you met me first
Oh, you would have loved me
If you met me firstEmbed
