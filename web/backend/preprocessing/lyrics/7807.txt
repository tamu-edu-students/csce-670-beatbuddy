30 ContributorsFearless Lyrics[Chorus]
Man, I've been fearless, I let 'em feel this
You know I spit it, no cap when I kill this
I'm 'bout to hit 'em with the raps, let 'em hear this
Swear, this world tour 'bout to be a field trip, yuh
Stack it up and then I double it
No time for mumbling,  show 'em where trouble is
Been with my team, plotting my things
Living my dreams, yeah it's obscene

[Verse 1]
Word around here, been blessed
Everything you hear my best
The game looks clear, no test
Won't stop til my peers SESH
Won't stop, won't stop, no I don't rest
All you wanna talk about is how rich you are
Made one mil' and bought fifty cars
Your label sucks, stuck in a three-sixty
Not Harrison, but I'm still indie
Absurd, yeah I'm a man of my word
The music finally 'bout to burst
They wanting me dead in a hearse
They wanna copy how I work
I hit 'em like, "Yeah good luck"
From the sun up to the moon up
I made tracks on tracks, stack views up
All these rappers lying, with a ruse up
I am not one of them, don't confuse us, uh
You might also like[Chorus]
Man I've been fearless, I let 'em feel this
You know I spit it, no cap when I kill this
I'm 'bout to hit 'em with the raps, let 'em hear this
Swear this world tour 'bout to be a field trip, yuh
Stack it up and then I double it
No time for mumbling, show 'em where trouble is
Been with my team, plotting my things
Living my dreams, yeah it's obscene

[Verse 2]
Been that lost boy, but I'm still here
Crawling up, ain't got no fears
Put me on the map and I'ma show 'em rap
All that fake stuff, got no time for that
And my pain, turned it into a new outlook and lane
Really 'bout to win it and put 'em to shame
Show 'em what fire is, burning for days
Music just won't be the same
They just want to see me fail
Every time I will avail
All their music sounding stale
My music the holy grail
Been too long to quit, I made too many waves, yuh
'Bout to feel the bliss when I step foot on stage, ayy
[Chorus]
Man I've been fearless, I let 'em feel this
You know I spit it, no cap when I kill this
I'm 'bout to hit 'em with the raps, let 'em hear this
Swear this world tour 'bout to be a field trip, yuh
Stack it up and then I double it
No time for mumbling, show 'em where trouble is
Been on my team, plotting my things
Living my dreams, yeah it's obscene

[Outro]
Fearless, I let 'em feel this
You know I spit it, no cap when I kill this
I'm 'bout to hit 'em with the raps, let 'em hear this
Swear this world tour 'bout to be a field trip, yuh
Stack it up and then I double it
No time for mumbling, show 'em where trouble is
Been on my team, plotting my things
Living my dreams, yeah it's obscene9Embed
