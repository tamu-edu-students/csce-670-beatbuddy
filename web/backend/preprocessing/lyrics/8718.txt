One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

[Verse 1]
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

[Pre-Chorus]
Something in you-ou-ou
Lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

[Chorus]
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

Feel your eyes do the exploring
Passion in the message when you smile
Take my time

[Pre-Chorus]

Lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
