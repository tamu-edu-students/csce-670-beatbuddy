1 ContributorStranger Lyrics[Intro]
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger

[Verse 1]
I can feel your body, yeah
It's in your eyes I see you want it
You crave it, you need this, yeah
So come get it, I've got it, yeah

[Chorus]
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger

'Cause I'vе been waiting all night
I don't need something right
And I feel I'm pulling you in
You don't need another one
I'll bе everything you ever want
Ever want

[Bridge]
Don't need a heart tonight
Just wanna a body moving side to side
Don't think about it, boy, just move for me
Move for me, move for me

[Chorus]
(Kiss me like a stranger)
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
(Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger)
[Outro]
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my dangerEmbed
