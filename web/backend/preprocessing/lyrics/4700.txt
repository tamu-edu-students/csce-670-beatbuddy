56 ContributorsTurbulent Lyrics[Verse 1]
You had your own Pete Wentz and Patrick combined
Writing you songs and singing them all like
Every single day
Tour brings that special pain

[Pre-Chorus]
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe, but not in you and me, so
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe, but not in you and me, so

[Chorus]
I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent
I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent

[Verse 2]
You had your own Awsten Knight (Hi)
He texted back fast, and he made you laugh, yeah, yeah
You must be out of your mind
Well, I know you are
Let's see, where to start?
How about the messages that you still send?
Even though I blocked your number
And I never fucking answer
My anxiety was turbulent and permanent
You gave me hell on Earth
And said to work with it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe, but not in you and me, so
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe, but not in you and me, so

[Chorus]
I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent
I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent

[Outro]
You had a taste of the life
But you grew complacent
And my sanity laced itself
Up in the back of your mind
And that's where you left me to die28Embed
