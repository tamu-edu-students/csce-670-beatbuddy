Sailing the Sunset Strip, I'm a bit of a king
Granny will take a trip, I'll be bending the string
Got hammers in both my hands, such a delicate touch
They say I'm from Amsterdam, does that make me Dutch?

[Chorus]
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me, Lord and children
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983

[Verse 2]
Smokin' the reefer, feeling my own life
My brother's a keeper, I married a TV wife
The devil's Camaro parkеd in a high school lot
A leather sombrero 'causе teacher was way too hot

[Chorus]
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me, listen, Lord, now
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983

[Bridge]
Tell my love, but leave me never
Can't complain about the weather
Snowing at the Rainbow, have a ball
Cut my teeth down at the Whiskey
GTOs tried to kiss me
One more song, they have seen it all

[Chorus]
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me, what I say, Lord
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983

[Post-Chorus]
Please don't remember me for what I did with David
You know I'm talkin' David Lee, am I ready?
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
I guess I played a Flying V
