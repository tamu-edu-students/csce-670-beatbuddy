Thunder
You made us

[Verse 1]
Your mental state afraid of mystic waste
No matter how hard you try
You’re bitter all the time
The lie to follow
Our time is now
We must let go the weight pulling us down

[Chorus]
Realise you’re not alone
They love you like a god
Get out where you belong
Now

Our time is now
To Conquer
Our time is now
Whenever

[Pre-Verse]
Thunder
You raised us
You might also like[Verse 2]
We’ve been to see today the world is blind
We've lost our sight to the bottom of the sea
No way
Our back to the wall
We’ll change the roads
Disobey the mentor

[Chorus]
Realise you’re not alone
They love you like a god
Get out where you belong
Now

[Solo]

[Breakdown]
Go
Go
Go
Go
Now

[Chorus]
Our time is now
To Conquer
Our time is now
Forever
[Outro]
Go
Realise you're not alone
They love you like a God
Get out and seize the day
NowEmbed
