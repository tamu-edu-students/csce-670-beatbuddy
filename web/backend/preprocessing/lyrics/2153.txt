Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with the cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you (Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do (Even though I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('Cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (Isn't what it could be)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it (Ah, ah)
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Bridge]
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you
[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to (When I'm not supposed to)
When I'm lyin' close to someone else (Ah, ah)
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it (Oh, oh)
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you, I'll go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you (I'll go back to you)
I'll go back to you (I'll go back to you, ooh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I know I'd go back to you

[Outro]
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
