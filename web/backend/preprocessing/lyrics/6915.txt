One little finger, one little finger
One little finger, tap-tap-tap
Point your finger up
Point your finger down
Put it on your head, head!

[Verse 2]
One little finger, one little finger
One little finger, tap-tap-tap
Point your finger up
Point your finger down
Put it on your nose, nose!

[Verse 3]
One little finger, one little finger
One little finger, tap-tap-tap
Point your finger up
Point your finger down
Put it on your chin, chin!

[Verse 4]
One little finger, one little fingеr
One little finger, tap-tap-tap
Point your fingеr up
Point your finger down
Put it on your arm, arm!

One little finger, tap-tap-tap
Point your finger up
Point your finger down
Put it on your leg, leg!

[Verse 6]
One little finger, one little finger
One little finger, tap-tap-tap
Point your finger up
Point your finger down
Put it on your foot, foot!
Put it on your leg, leg!
Put it on your arm, arm!
Put it on your chin, chin!
Put it on your nose, nose!
Put it on your head, head!

Now, let's wave goodbye
Goodbye!Embed
