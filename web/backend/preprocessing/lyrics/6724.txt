I'm done feeling worthless
Imperfect
You hit me where it hurts
You put the blade right on my wrist
And slit until it spurts
Out blood, red, dead
That’s just how I'm feeling
You tell me that you love me
But there you go leaving
Why you so surprised?
You're a demon in disguise
These past two weeks all I been doing is crying
Tired of putting all my effort
But never receiving
You tell me I’m a piece of shit
And that I really feel it

[Hook]
I'm not enough, and I'm sorry
I really love you, and I'm sorry
I struggle at showing, and I'm sorry
You pretend to smile, and I'm sorry
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
I'm done feeling worthless
Imperfect
You hit me where it hurts
You put the blade right on my wrist
And slit until it spurts
Out blood, red, dead
That's just how I’m feeling
You tell me that you love me
But there you go leaving
Why you so surprised?
You’re a demon in disguise
These past two weeks all I been doing is crying
Tired of putting all my effort
But never receiving
You tell me I'm a piece of shit
And that I really feel it

I’m not enough, and I'm sorry
I really love you, and I'm sorry
I struggle at showing, and I'm sorry
You pretend to smile, and I’m sorry
No, no no
