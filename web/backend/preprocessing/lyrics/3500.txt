Hey hey hey hey

[ELIZA]
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Hey hey hey hey
Dooo! Hey!
Hey hey hey hey
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Hey hey hey hey
Dooo! Boy you got me
Hey hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went “Boom!”
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume
You might also like[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

[ELIZA & ALL WOMEN]
Grab my sister, and whisper, “Yo, this one's mine.” (Ooh)
My sister made her way across the room to you (Ooh)
And I got nervous, thinking “What's she gonna do?” (Ooh)
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' “I'm through” (Ooh)
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!
Oh, look at those eyes
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
Oh!
I'm helpless
Yeah, I'm helpless, I know
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
I'm helpless
I'm so into you
Look into your eyes
I am so into you
And the sky's the limit, I'm helpless
I know I'm down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?
[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later
[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, 'cause she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him

[ELIZA & ALL WOMEN]
Ha!
Two weeks later in the living room stressin' (stressin')
My father's stone-faced while you're asking for his blessin' (blessin')
I'm dying inside, as you wine and dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry ‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do (Ooh)
My father makes his way across the room to you (Ooh)
I panic for a second, thinking “we're through”(Ooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says “Be true” (Ooh)
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless! (Helpless!)
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless
Helpless
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em (hoo!)
I'm helpless!
That boy is mine, that boy is mine
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless
Helpless, helpless
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so…

[ALL WOMEN, ELIZA, & HAMILTON]
Helpless!
I do, I do, I do, I do!
Eliza
Helpless!
I do, I do, I do, I do!
I've never felt so—
Helpless!
Hey, yeah, yeah!
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
I'm down for the count, I'm—
Helpless!
My life is gon' be fine 'cause Eliza's in it
Helpless!
I look into your eyes and the sky's the limit, I'm—
Helpless!
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
...drownin' in 'em
[ALL WOMEN]
In New York, you can be a new man…
In New York, you can be a new man…
In New York, you can be a new man…
