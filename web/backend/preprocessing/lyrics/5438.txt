3 ContributorsHot Stuff (12" Version) Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

[Chorus 1]
Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff, gotta have some love tonight
(Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff, I need hot stuff

[Verse 2]
Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm-blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

[Chorus 2]
Gotta have some hot love, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin', gotta have love tonight (Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
Hot love, lookin' for hot love

Lookin' for hot stuff, wanna have a hot love

Won't spend another night on my own
I dialed about a hundred numbers lately
I'm bound to find somebody home
