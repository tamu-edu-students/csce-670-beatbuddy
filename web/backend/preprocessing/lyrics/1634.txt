Between the gaps, I was swimming laps
Got close to some epiphany
I'll convince a friend to join deep ends
Have your toes touch the lack of cement

[Pre-Chorus]
Gather to one corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
And centerfold, humility shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn

[Chorus]
Aren't you glad that you reside in a Hell and in disguise?
Nobody yet everything, a pool to shed your memory
Could you say you even tried?
You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes diffеrently
But I show up to the party just to leavе

[Verse 2]
Between the gaps, keep it under wraps
How I got to some epiphany
I'll convince myself when it turns to twelve
The photos keep the sentiment
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Gather to one corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
And centerfold, humility shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn

[Chorus]
Aren't you glad that you reside in a Hell and in disguise?
Nobody yet everything, a pool to shed your memory
Could you say you even tried?
You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes differently
But I show up to the party just to leave

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Pulling back, I tried to find
The point of wasting precious time
I sip and toast to normalcy
A fool's way into jealousy
I mock and imitate goodbyes
When I know that I can't deny
That I'll be here forever while
I show up to the party just to leave29Embed Amoeba Sling Clairo indie-pop
