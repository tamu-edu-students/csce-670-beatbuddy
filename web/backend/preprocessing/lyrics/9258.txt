13 ContributorsWhy You No Love Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Help me understand it
Woke up empty-handed
Never heard you say goodbye
Do you remember summer said she'd go forever
Then you turn as cold as the weather
And left me here to cry and cry
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why you no love me?
Why you no love me?
Why you no even care?
Why you no love me?
Why you no love me?
Why you no will be there?

[Verse 2]
Shattered, come to find that none of it mattered
Empty like the promise you made me
Flat out on the floor, oh no
Hurt me once, I let it be
Hurt me twice, you're dead to me
Three times makes you family
Why can't you see I'm yours?
Tell me
You might also like[Chorus]
Why you no love me?
Why you no love me? (Why you no love me?)
Why you no even care?
(Don't you know I want you? Ooh)
Why you no love me? (Why you no love me?)
Why you no love me? (Why you no love me?)
Why you no will be there?

[Instrumental Solo]

[Outro]
Why you no love me?
Why you no love me?
Why you no even care?
(Don't you know I want you? Ooh)
Why you no love me? (Why you no love me, baby?)
Why you no love me? (Why you no love me, girl?)
Why you no will be there? (Why you no will be there?)
Why you no will be?
Why you no will be there?Embed
