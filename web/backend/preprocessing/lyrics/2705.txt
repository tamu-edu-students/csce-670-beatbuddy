20 ContributorsHysteria Lyrics[Verse 1]
Out of touch, out of reach, yeah
You could try to get closer to me
I'm in love, I'm in deep, yeah
Hypnotized, I'm shaking to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I got to know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

[Chorus]
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria, oh, can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feeling better start believing
Because it's a miracle, oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

[Verse 2]
Out of me, into you, yeah
You can hide, it's just a one way street
Oh, I believe I'm in you, yeah
Open wide that's right, dream me off my feet
Oh, believe in me
