My love must be a kind of blind love;
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop

[Chorus 1]
Are the stars out tonight?
(Sha bop sha bop)
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you, dear
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
The moon may be high
(Sha bop sha bop)
But I can't see a thing in the sky
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you

[Verse 2]
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
(Sha bop sha bop)
You might also like[Chorus 2]
You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you

[Outro]
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)4Embed I Only Have Eyes for You Flamingo Serenade The Flamingos blues
