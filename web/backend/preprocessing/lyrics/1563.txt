On the low
Only love myself, no more
Take you to the grave, I'll ghost
I know I can be so cold
In the dark
Where I like to keep my heart
Know I'm all bite, no bark
Like to catch you way off guard

[Pre-Chorus: Madison Beer]
I'll stay so deep inside your brain
And take you somewhere far away

[Chorus: Madison Beer, Kim Petras]
Time to roll the dice, you know I'm the type
Type to risk my life, not afraid to die
Type to make you cry, type to put a price
All up on your head, do just what I said
I'm a straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling
Straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling

[Post-Chorus: Madison Beer]
I'm alive, but I'm dead
Hear my voice up in your head
Watch it fill you full of drеad
'Til you go pow

Is it really a surprise if I'm playing with your mind
And I treat you likе a prize, then I throw you to the side?
And am I really that bad if l love to make you mad?
And get happy when you're sad, only care about a bag

[Verse 3: Kim Petras]
In control
That's how I like it and I'm never letting go, nah
Never had a soul (Soul)
So you ain't taking nothing from me when you go, nah

[Pre-Chorus: Kim Petras]
I'll stay so deep inside your brain
And take you somewhere far away

[Chorus: Kim Petras]
Time to roll the dice, you know I'm the type
Type to risk my life, not afraid to die
Type to make you cry, type to put a price
All up on your head, do just what I said
I'm a straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling (Yeah, yeah)
Straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling
[Post-Chorus: Kim Petras]
I'm alive, but I'm dead
Hear my voice up in your head
Watch it fill you full of dread
'Til you go pow

[Bridge: Madison Beer &  Kim Petras]
Bang, bang
You can do anything
No fear, no pain
Listen to your brain go
Go stupid, go dumb, go stupid and
Then we go insane, woah
Just do what I say
Follow me, I'll lead the way

[Chorus: Madison Beer & Kim Petras, Madison Beer & Kim Petras]
Time to roll the dice, you know I'm the type
Type to risk my life, not afraid to die
Type to make you cry, type to put a price (Woo-ah)
All up on your head, do just what I said
I'm a straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling
Straight up villain, straight up villain (Yeah)
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling (Woo-ah!)
