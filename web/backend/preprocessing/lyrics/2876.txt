Can you feel it? Now it's comin' back
We can steal it if we bridge this gap
I can see ya through the curtains of the waterfall
When I lost it, yeah, you held my hand
But I tossed it, didn't understand
You were waitin' as I dove into the waterfall

[Chorus]
So, say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away
Can you feel my love? (My love, my love, my love, my love)
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away
Say Geronimo

[Verse 2]
Well, we rushed it, movin' way too fast
That we crushed it, but it's in the past
We can make this leap through the curtains of the waterfall
You might also like[Chorus]
So, say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel my love? (My love, my love, my love, my love)
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away
Can you feel my love? (My love, my love, my love, my love)
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away

[Bridge]
Well, I'm just a boy with a broken toy
All lost and coy at the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand as a broken man
But I've found my friend at the curtains of the waterfall
Now I'm falling down through the crashing sound
And you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall
And you rush to me and it sets us free
So I fall to my knees at the curtains of the waterfall

[Chorus]
So say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)
(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)
Bombs away, bombs away
(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)
Bombs away
(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)

[Outro]
Can you feel my love?
(Make this leap)
(Make this leap)
(Make this leap, ooh)
(Make this leap, ooh)
Can you feel my love?39Embed
