28 ContributorsWorst of You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You promise it's different
You swear that you listened
I don't mind if you didn't
'Cause I just love the sound of your voice
You role-play the good guy
Lemon juice your white lies
But I see 'em in the sunrise

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me right in the palm of your hand and you know it
Oh, it's what you do
So let me drown, I'll be there with the band
Hit the sea bed, all I'd see is you

[Chorus]
So give me your worst excuses, any reason to stay
Give me your lips that taste of her, I'd kiss them again
I'd rather you walk all over me than walk away
Give me the worst of you
'Cause I want you anyway
So take me to every party and just talk to your friends
Why don't you let me down, I'll let you do it again
Go on and walk all over me, just don't walk away
Give me the worst of you
'Cause I want you anyway

We make up, but I know
We'll fistfight through iPhones
My left hook a no-show
'Cause I'll just keep letting you win
But, baby, the truth is I make your excuses
You let me down and I'm used to it

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me right in the palm of your hand and you know it
Oh, it's what you do
So let me drown, I'll be there with the band
Hit the sea bed, all I'd see is you, oh

[Chorus]
So give me your worst excuses, any reason to stay
Give me your lips that taste of her, I'd kiss them again
I'd rather you walk all over me than walk away
Give me the worst of you
'Cause I want you anyway
So take me to every party and just talk to your friends
Why don't you let me down, I'll let you do it again
Go on and walk all over me, just don't walk away
Give me the worst of you
'Cause I want you anyway, anyway, anyway, ay
'Cause I want you anyway, anyway, anyway, ay
[Outro]
Another night, another dotted line
I sign my heart
Away to you, some call it foolish
Guess I'll call it art10Embed
