5 ContributorsOne Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
I always thought you were the best
I guess I always will
I always thought that we were blessed
And I feel that way still
Sometimes we took the hard road
But we always saw it through

[Chorus]
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes the world was on our side
Sometimes it wasn't fair
Sometimes it gave a helping hand
Sometimes we didn't care

[Refrain]
'Cause when we were together
It made the dream come true

[Chorus]
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you
You might also like[Verse 3]
Someone who understands me
And knows me inside out
And helps keep me together
And believes without a doubt
That I could move a mountain
Someone to tell it to

[Chorus]
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
'Cause when we were together
It made the dream come true

[Chorus]
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you

[Verse 4]
Someone who understands me
And knows me inside out
And helps keep me together
And believes without a doubt
That I could move a mountain
Someone to tell it to
[Chorus]
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be youEmbed
