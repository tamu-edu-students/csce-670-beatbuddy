Feel your eyes, they all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight

Baby girl, yuh ah carry ten ton a phatness, gimme some a dat (Gimme dat)
Mixed wid di badness, look how she hot (Gyal, yuh hot)
Shaped like goddess, but a nah jus dat

Hot piece of game an' mi love how yuh trod (Stepper)
Watching every step a di pepper deh weh yuh got (Pepper)
Stayin' in my brain, memory nah detach (Memo')
Mainly my aim is to give yuh this love

Hypnotic, the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do

Move so hypnotic
