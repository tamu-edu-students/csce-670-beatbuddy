9 ContributorsHead in the Clouds Lyrics[Verse 1]
I miss the days when life was so simple
Felt like the glass was always half-full
Where did that go?
And every second with you was so special
Back when we didn't fear the unknowns
But that was long ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Who can say where the path will go?
Philosophers guess, but they just don't know
Maybe that's why

[Chorus]
We had our heads in the clouds
Thought we had it all figured out
Planning to fly away
To escape everything on the ground
But like a plane up in space
We slowly drifted away
And every plan that we made
And dream that we chased
Are just memories now
They're just memories now

[Verse 2]
I'm not sure where everything went wrong
But I know that we landed where we both belong
I just wish we weren't scared to say
That there's expiration dates on the friends you make
As hard as that may sound
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Who can say where the path will go?
Philosophers guess but they just don't know
Maybe that's why

[Chorus]
We had our heads in the clouds
Thought we had it all figured out
Planning to fly away
To escape everything on the ground
But like a plane up in space
We slowly drifted away
And every plan that we made
And dream that we chased
Are just memories now
They're just memories now

[Outro]
Who can say where the path will go? (Where the path will go)
Philosophers guess, but they just don't know (But they just don't know)2Embed Head In The Clouds Changes - EP Hayd singer-songwriter
