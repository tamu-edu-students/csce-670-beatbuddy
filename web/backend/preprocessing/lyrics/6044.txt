15 Contributors03' Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ay, I'm still that same old brother with the steeze
Tryna get a gaff, got a yard ‘round east
Open more doors, might need more keys
Tryna see more bands for my guys and G's
Tetley talk for the boys on local
But vocal, she don't know 'bout me
Wanna talk 'bout me with the guys in the four
Wanna see tour boat guys on tour
Violence try for, I use that top up Bare YG's
Wanna see man walk
Baby girl, tell me the gossip
See, man’s got it, squares do flips, man lock it
Know that my team's alright, flex all night
Tryna see full take flight, I was out in the hood all night
And the yutes, dem cry
And they stand tall like sky
YSM flex on bright man, it's on for the night

[Verse 2]
I left out far tryna make some penny
Local Jеnny was lovin' mans flex
Two dumb goons on the block
Wanna take mans drop
But wait thеy ain't got no friends
Call mans striker on Lyca
That's a dangerous call
We don't know 'bout friends
I was way too cool for the guys like you
I was tryna make bands when I left my school
Ay (yeah), I'm waitin' for a lie (kay)
More time you can't say that I'm average, I'm different
Baby girl that's right
Wine and talk and I flex in the coupe
That's me and you on call for the night
When I talk 'bout the way that I move on the tune
Baby girl that's lotion in motion
When I ghost on friends and go ocean
You can take my drink and take potion
Yeah, I was tryna make my P's on side
My bro on four, shit, it's my friends on tour
What can I say? Baby girl, I'm yours
Bare brave flex baby girl on course
She bare love on the way I flex
I dress way better than her ex
More money spent on the girls and friend
But you know 'bout me I don't do no less
Talks on the way that I move my prices in crisis
When I move my cheques
I'm after the money,not women
Yeah, they said I won't make it I'm here
Right now man they spinnin'
Y S to the M, I'm winning
Nobody see's pistol killin'
I was out with my [?] on tour
Racks need more
Tryna make up for the fall
The jakes wanna take mans pay
I can't let them take no moreYou might also likeEmbed
