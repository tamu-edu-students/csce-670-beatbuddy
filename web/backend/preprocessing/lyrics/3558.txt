Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
Well, I'm an animal
Somethin' like a cannibal
I'm very flammable
And partially programmable
Centuries of overuse
Now I wear it nice and loose

[Verse 2]
Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
Well, it's ubiquitous
Tell me, can you stick to this?
I'm on the brink of this
And tell me what you think of this
I'm in the Beauregard
Slow me down if I get hard

[Chorus]
We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what the kiss would say
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Gonna get you now

[Verse 3]
Her perfume smells like gasoline
My girlfriend's trash is nice and clean
Acid landing on my tongue
I think you know we've just begun
She don't want the ladies' room
Transatlantic super groom

[Verse 4]
Your hairplane is a monument
The sexy art of condiments
And now I know you by your scent
Let it bleed, we both get bent
Need a minute to prepare
Sonny's side was always Cher

[Chorus]
We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what your kiss would say
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
Well, I believe in love
Perfectly receivin' love
It's vociferous
And come and get a whiff of this
I'm at the pyramids
Never had a fear of kids

[Verse 6]
Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
I'm on the precipice
Come and make a mess of this
It's the apocalypse
I try to get a sock of this
I'm at the county fair
Haystack ride, I'll pull your hair

[Chorus]
We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what your kiss would say
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what your kiss would say
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Gonna get you now2Embed Tippa My Tongue Tippa My Tongue Red Hot Chili Peppers metal
