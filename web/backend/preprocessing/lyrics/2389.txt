60 ContributorsSunshine of Your Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
It’s getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I’ll soon be with you, my love
Give you my dull surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll be with you, darling, soon
I’ll be with you when the stars start falling

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

[Verse 2]
I’m with you, my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning and just we two

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll stay with you, darlin', now
I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting so long

I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
