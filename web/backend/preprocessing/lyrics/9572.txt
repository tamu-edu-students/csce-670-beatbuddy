Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh, ah
Oh-oh-oh, ah

[Verse 1: Luke Smallbone]
This is for the busted hearts
This is for the question marks
This is for the outcast soul
Lost control, no one knows
Sing it for the can't-go-back
Sing it for the broken past
Sing it for the just found out
Life is now upside down

[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone]
If you're lookin' for hope tonight, raise your ha-and
If you feelin' alone and don't understa-and
If you're fightin' in the fight of your life, then sta-and
We're gonna make it through this hand-in-ha-and

[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone & Choir]
And if we fall, we will fall together
Together

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly]
Ooh, this is for the second chance
This is for the new romance
Sing it for the loved in vain
Overcame, it's not too late
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone & Tori Kelly]
If you're lookin' for hope tonight, raise your ha-and
If you feelin' alone and don't understa-and
If you're fightin' in the fight of your life, then sta-and
We're gonna make it through this hand-in-ha-and

[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone, Tori Kelly & Choir, Tori Kelly]
And if we fall, we will fall together
Together
Oh, and when we rise, we will rise together
Together, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Ooh, ooh (Listen)

[Bridge: Kirk Franklin, Choir & Tori Kelly]
(If you're lookin' for hope tonight) And you're all alone
(If you're feelin' alone tonight) And you feel
(If you're in the fight of your life) I can promise
(We're gonna make it happen) Oh, yeah
(I will be by your side) By your side
('Cause love is in the air tonight) Can you feel it?
(Come up and see the light) Come on!
(Whenever, ever, ever, just as long as we're together, say)
[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone, Tori Kelly & Choir, Joel Smallbone, Kirk Franklin, Choir & [Tori Kelly]]
If we fall (Fall), we will fall together
Haha, I got you, my brother
Together
I see you, my sister
And when we rise, we will rise together
Together (Help me stand)
[Oh-oh-oh-oh] (Woo!)
If we fall (Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, [If we fall])
We will fall together (Oh-oh-oh, ah, oh-oh-oh, ah, take my hand)
Together (Help me stand)
And when we rise (Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, [when we rise])
We will rise together (Oh-oh-oh, ah, oh-oh-oh, ah, [we will rise together])
Together (Yes, sir!)

[Outro: Joel Smallbone]
Together we are dangerous
Together with our differences
Together we are bolder, braver, stronger6Embed
