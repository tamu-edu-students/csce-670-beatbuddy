4 ContributorsDon’t Hurt Me (What Is Love) Lyrics[Intro]
What is love?

[Verse 1]
I can see your face in the most crowded room (Crowded room)
You can make me feel like it is just us two (Just us two)
It's like I'm runnin', runnin' out of my breath, but I'm standin' still
Your touch is shootin' right through my chest, how can this be real?
I know that I would be droppin' dead if your looks could kill
And your looks can kill

[Chorus]
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more

[Drop]
Don't hurt me no more
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more

You can make me feel like it is just us two (Just us two)
It's like I'm runnin', runnin' out of my breath, but I'm standin' still
Your touch is shootin' right through my chest, how can this be real?
I know that I would be droppin' dead if your looks could kill
And your looks can kill

[Chorus]
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more

Don't hurt me no more
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
