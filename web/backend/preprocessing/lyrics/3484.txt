30 ContributorsNikita Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey Nikita, is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow

[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

[Verse 2]
Do you ever dream of me?
And do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Never know anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

[Outro]
