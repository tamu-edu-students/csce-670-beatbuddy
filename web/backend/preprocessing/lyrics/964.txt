[Verse 1]
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah-yeah
Though this feeling I can't change
But, please, don't take it so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

But, if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change
[Outro]
Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
