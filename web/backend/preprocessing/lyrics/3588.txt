3 ContributorsHold Me Closer (Joel Corry Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Elton John & Britney Spears, Elton John]
I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands (Oh)

[Chorus: Elton John & Britney Spears, Britney Spears]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today, oh

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today, oh

[Post-Chorus: Elton John & Britney Spears]
Hold me closer, hold me closer (Hold me closer)
Hold me closer, hold me closer

[Verse 2: Elton John, Britney Spears & Both]
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels, baby (Yeah)
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
You might also like[Chorus: Elton John & Britney Spears, Britney Spears]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway (Yeah)
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway (Yeah)
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

[Post-Chorus: Elton John & Britney Spears]
Hold me closer, hold me closer (Baby, baby)
Hold me closer, hold me closer (Oh, yeah)

[Outro: Elton John & Britney Spears]
(Hold me closer)
(Hold me closer)
Hold me closer
(Hold me closer) Me closer, me closer
(Hold me closer) Mm, yeahEmbed
