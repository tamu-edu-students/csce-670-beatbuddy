7 ContributorsThe Woods Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're all falling and
We need a place to hide
A safe place somewhere in the woods
We can start the fire
All we know is what would be
Our home
We will stay
'Till the break of dawn

[Verse 2]
The cold night takes us to a place to escape the chill
Tucked up somewhere in the woods, on a hill
Wake up, feeling the cold in between our toes
Is there a way back? Nobody knows

[Bridge]
And we leave it all behind
Can't you see we need some time?
And we all sit around the fire
We feel a little warmer now
And we all sit around the fire
We feel so much better now!

[Chorus]
And we all sit around the fire
We feel a little warmer now
And we all sit around the fire
We feel so much better now!

And we all sit around the fire
We feel a little warmer now
And we all sit around the fire
We feel so much better now!2Embed
