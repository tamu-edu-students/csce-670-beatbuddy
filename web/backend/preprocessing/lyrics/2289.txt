If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you, I see forever, oh, so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know, by now, how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know, by now, how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

[Verse 2]
If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star
I'll be there for you if you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever, too
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know, by now, how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know, by now, how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know, by now, how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

[Bridge]
Woah, woah

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna change my love for you (Da-da-da-da-da)
You ought to know, by now, how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know, by now, how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know, by now, how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
[Outro]
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know1Embed Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You 20/20 George Benson j-rock
