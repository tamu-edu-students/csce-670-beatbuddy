Let's get it on
Yeah, y'all can come along
Everybody drinks on me
Bought out the bar
Just to feel like I'm a star
Now I'm thanking the Academy
Missed my ride home
Lost my iPhone
I wouldn't have it any other way
If you're with me let me hear you say

[Chorus: Ryan Follese]
I like it like that
Hey, windows down, chillin' with the radio on
I like it like that
Damn, sun's so hot, make the girls take it all off
I like it like that
Yeah, one more time, I can never get enough
Oh, everybody
Sing it right back, I like it like that
(I like it like that, I like it like that)

[Verse 2: Ryan Follese]
Till the break of the dawn
Yeah, party on the lawn
Whistle as the girls walk by
If the cops roll up (so what?)
Pour the cops a cup
'Cause everybody's here tonight
Call a taxi
Pack the back seat
I wouldn't have it any other way
If you're with me let me hear you say
You might also like[Chorus: Ryan Follese]
I like it like that
Hey windows down, chillin' with the radio on

Oh, everybody
Sing it right back, I like it like that

[Post-Chorus: Ryan Follese]

[Verse 3: New Boyz]
Oh the homie brought the booze
I like it like that 'cause the girls playin' beer pong in the back
We havin' fun partying til the break of dawn
Go grab a cup I dunno what people waitin' on
And I'm gonna want a girl that I know I can take home
In the zone, where I think I had lost my phone
You can tell by looking in the party's straight crack
And don't worry 'bout it girls cause I like it like

[Verse 4: New Boyz]
I'm max faded at my grandma's house
And leave your clothes over there, that's grandma couch
I be filmin' her friends too, yeah I'm back on that
Double D chicks huggin', I got racks on racks
Like, I don't want the luxuries of a superstar
I'm just tryin' to chill with Miley at the hookah bar
You like got tongues, I'll make your heart melt
With the seat back, playin in the back, like
