Sorry
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like sorry, like sorry

[Verse 2]
Forgive me
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me, forgive me

[Chorus]
But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time
You'd be mine

[Verse 3]
I love you
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like I love you, I love you
You might also like[Chorus]
But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time, you'd be mine

[Outro]
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time, you'd be mine
You'd be mine
You'd be mine1Embed Baby Can I Hold You Tracy Chapman Tracy Chapman songwriter
