1 ContributorNo Condemnation LyricsLike mud in the bottom of a cup of solid gold
A stain upon the pure
But a veil to cover the soil
From His life I learned perfection
But His death gave even more
It's like a diamond promise
And His love I can't ignore

Chorus:
No condemnation
No separation
Our destination
Is sanctification

To the keen ears of a dog
The philosophy is told
And from the crumbs of His table tumble secrets to the prophecies of old
It's like handing out the keys
To the cells on death row
Now I'm a dead man walking
And His cross I'm bound to tow

Don't you see what He's done for me?
Did you know His grace would go this far?
The power to forgive
And the strength so you can live
I have become His righteousnessYou might also likeEmbed
