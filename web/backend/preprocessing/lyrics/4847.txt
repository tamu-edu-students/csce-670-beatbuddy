Sing it louder, this is my last melody
Living in my dreams, I don't know what is real
And you’ll never know what it takes, what it is …

Can you save me in the morning?
When the pain I feel inside
It's so hard you didn't notice
That I really want to die
But you know I have a mission
I don’t wanna see you cry
Baby leave your inhibitions
Baby open up your eyes

Saying ay oh
Saying ay oh
I don't wanna leave this place, I'm by your side
Singing ay oh
Singing ay oh
I'm just killing all the demons of my mind

Can you save my life, save my soul, let me be?
Sing it louder, this is my last melody
Living in my drеams, I don't know what is real
And you'll never know what it takеs, what it is

Living in my dreams, I don't know what is real
And you'll never know what it takes, what it is

Can you save me when I’m lonely?
If you only hold me tight
Manifesting our vision
Every day and every night
But you know I have a mission
I don’t wanna see you cry
Baby leave your inhibitions
Let me open up your eyes

Saying ay oh
Saying ay oh
I don't wanna leave this place, I’m by your side
Singing ay oh
Singing ay oh
I'm just killing all the demons of my mind

Can you save my life, save my soul, let me be?
Sing it louder, this is my last melody
Living in my dreams, I don't know what is real
And you'll never know what it takes, what it isEmbed
