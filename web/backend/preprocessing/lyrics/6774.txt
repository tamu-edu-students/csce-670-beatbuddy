I see your sister in her Sunday dress
She's out to please, she pouts her best
She's out to take, no need to try
She's ready to make

[Chorus]
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me, baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me

[Verse 2]
Cars are crashin' every night
I drink and drive everything's in sight
I make the fire, but I miss the firefight
I hit the bullseye every night

[Chorus]
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me, baby
Yeah, it's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me

[Post-Chorus]
It's so easy
But nothin' seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
See me hit you, you fall down, huh
You might also like[Verse 3]
I see you standin' there
You think you're so cool
Why don't you just
Fuck off?

[Verse 4]
You get nothin' for nothin' if that's what you do
Turn around, bitch, I got a use for you
Besides, you ain't got nothin' better to do
And I'm bored

[Chorus]
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me, baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me

[Post-Chorus]
It's so easy
But nothin' seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
So come with me
Don't ask me where 'cause I don't know
I'll try to please you
I ain't got no money, but it goes to show
[Chorus]
It's so easy, so fucking easy
It's so easy, so damn easy
It's so easy, oh, so fuckin' easy
It's so easy, yeah, so easy

[Outro]
It's so easy, so fuckin' easy
It's so easy, yeah!15Embed It's So Easy Appetite For Destruction Guns N' Roses hard-rock
