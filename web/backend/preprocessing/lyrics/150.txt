When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
You might also like[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here277Embed
