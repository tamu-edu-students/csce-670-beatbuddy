48 ContributorsComatose Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hate feeling like this
I'm so tired of trying to fight this
I'm asleep and all I dream of is waking to you
Tell me that you will listen
Your touch is what I'm missing
And the more I hide I realize I'm slowly losing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

[Chorus]
I don't want to live
I don't want to breathe
'Less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)
I don't want to sleep
I don't want to dream
'Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)

[Verse 2]
I hate living without you
Dead wrong to ever doubt you
But my demons lay in waiting
Tempting me away
Oh, how I adore you
Oh, how I thirst for you
Oh, how I need you

Waking up
My eyes open up
