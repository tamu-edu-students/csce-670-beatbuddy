1 ContributorRap More LyricsIts a race to hell nothings funny Dave Chapelle
I play this well
And i still fucking hate myself
I race down streets
Like a lake down stream
I shit on everyone
And make a brown streak hey, allow me to explain, why i rap
And what i have to gain
Why i have to play it right because this is a game
Focus on everyone and then everything
You see and
Imma have like 7 plays, by 17
And by 24 i should have more
Just gotta rap more
Climb out the trap door
Don’t close the back door yeah
Celebratе success with the peoplе that you need and
Don’t let it bother you when people wanna leave and
People need attention i shoulda mentioned
Its no invention sub dimension
Break down your mind and cut your comprehension
An extension
Its intention is to put you in suspension
No prevention
Stuck in a detention of attention

Go yell get it out go
Rap more
Break down scream and shout
Go rap more
Been coveted and guilt
Go rap more
Til I’m covered like a quilt

Yeah I’m
Covered in people and
Hands are all around my body
People wanna be me copy
Hit em, hockey man get off me
I can't be alone, i desire the eminent
I’m liar pretending that
I am higher then sentiments
Cinnamon crunch serial
Crunch serial numbers and hunt
Spherical hummers that bump lyrical hummers
And fuck clerical dumb words
And dumb material bummers
I need ethereal drummers
And real summers
And drive around fast
With the sound blasted
Blow gas and flow crap
Procrastinate and
Watch my music grow fast
Yeah I sit around in circles
And reveal secrets
Theres no keeping
Let it all out , and speak it
I’m in a deep pit an abyss
Its like a big cave when I’m pissed
I play it like a game theres no playin i missed or stain on my wrist
No pain I’m legit and
I’m swimming in the bane of my gift
Rap more
Go yell get it out go
Rap more
Break down scream and shout
Go rap more
Been coveted and guilt
Go rap more
Til I’m covered like a quiltEmbed
