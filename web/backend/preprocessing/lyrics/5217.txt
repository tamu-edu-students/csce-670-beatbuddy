Shriek the lips across ragged tongue
Convulsing together, sing violently
Move the jaw, cry aloud
Bound up the dead triumphantly

[Pre-Chorus]
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast

[Verse 2]
Stir the limbs across the wrist
Full possession of a memory
Bury me as a dog
Oh, icy hands surrounding me

[Pre-Chorus]
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see

[Verse 3]
Shriek the lips across ragged tongue
Convulsing two together, sing violently
Move the jaw, cry aloud
Bound up the dead triumphantly

[Pre-Chorus]
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast5Embed
