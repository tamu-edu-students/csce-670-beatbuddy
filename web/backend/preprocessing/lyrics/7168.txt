2 ContributorsJude’s Song Lyrics[Intro]
Mm, mm, mm
Yeah

[Chorus]
Call my name, I'll be there
Any night and any day
Take my hand, I got you
That'll always stay the same, yeah

[Verse 1]
Less of my time spent with myself
I wouldn't trade it for anything else
You got my eyes, I got your back
You and me, ain't nothing better than that
I hope one day that you'll listen to this song
Keepin' us close when I been gone
Every word was written for you, yeah, yeah
When I go, just know I'll come back
If traffic slow, just know I'd run back to you
I know this world can get kind of cold
Summer comes and it goes
Rain turns into snow
That's the way that it goes, yeah

[Chorus]
Call my name, I'll be thеre
Any night and any day
Take my hand, I got you
That'll always stay the samе, yeah

I can't wait 'til you're old enough when we can sit and have conversations
Tell me all bout what you want from life and all of your aspirations
Show you my favorite movies
I make these songs while you sleep
Every word was written for you, yeah, yeah
When you go, I'll be right here
Pick up the phone, I'll be right there
For you I know this world can get kind of cold, yeah
Summer comes and it goes, yeah
Rain turns into snow
But pain turns into hope, yeah

[Chorus]
Call my name, I'll be there
Any night and any day
Take my hand, I got you
That'll always stay the same, yeah

[Outro]
