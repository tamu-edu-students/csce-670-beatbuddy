Swimming around, there's something new to be found
It's such a beautiful sound, barenaked feet on the ground
Swimming around and I will sing you a song always
A nautical mile, you be the sun to my dial
I'll be the rank in your file, just come with me for a while
A nautical mile and I will shoot you the breeze always
Flowers in bloom, I get 'em off of the moon
To make my baby go boom, I put my grease in your spoon
Flowers in bloom and you're the colors of June some days

[Chorus]
Here we come, we're not far away
And I'll tell you more when I come to stay
Shoot me a smile and I will show you the love always
Here we come and we're very close
And I'll give you more with this micro dose
Shoot me a smile and I will show you the love always

[Verse 2]
Out on the road, I've got some cases to load
Some other places to go, some other faces to know
Out on the road, where I will show you the love parade
A lateral move with nothing better to prove
Just hanging out with the crew, I'll put the wop in your doo
A lateral move with nothing better to prove some days
Give me a home, I cannot make it alone
I need to share what I own, I'll be the cream in your cone
Give me a home and I will show you the love always

Here we come, we're not far away
And I'll tell you more when I come to stay
Shoot me a smile and I will show you the love always
Here we come and we're very close
And I'll give you more with this micro dose
Shoot me a smile and I will show you the love always

[Bridge]
I don't ever wanna lose my head
Last name's Hot and my first name's Red
I don't ever wanna get so tight
Wearin' it loose like a summer's night

[Verse 3]
Strappin' for cash, I'm eating bangers and mash
And I remember The Clash, and I remember The Clash
Strappin' for cash but I will make you feel safe always
Bring it around just like the fox and the hound
Because it's openly crowned, I'm on a merry-go-round
Bring it around and I will sleep with a smile always
I never began because I'm never to end
I'm gonna buck every trend, I'm gonna make you my friend
I never began, but I will give you a start always

[Chorus]
Here we come, we're not far away
And I'll tell you more when I come to stay
Shoot me a smile and I will show you the love always
Here we come and we're very close
And I'll give you more with this micro dose
Shoot me a smile and I will show you the love always1Embed
