Hahahaha…
Long live the king
The young grows old with his buffalo spring

[Verse 1]
I got a Tupelo and we're ready to go
We gonna hit it all night with a rock and a roll
And if I'm feelin' uptight, gonna leave it alone
We're gonna board up on the flight to the great unknown, well

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That's all I'm saying now
Hear what I'm playing, yes
High on a light from above
You're somebody special, well
Someone to wrestle now
Take from the lake of your love

[Chorus]
Long after we have been gone from this song
Well, the afterlife sings one for me
Lost in thе length of those warm-ass horizons
The aftеrlife knows where I'll be

[Verse 2]
We gonna get it up for the brotherly cup
And when I bring it on down with the Jamison Brown
Well, on a cold, cold night 'round a Baton a-Rouge
We gonna make it alright with Iggy the Stooge, well

Pull on my lever, it's
My guilty pleasure, yes
Born to live life on the run
Take from this river, and
Give to the ocean, yeah
They gave us more than enough

[Chorus]
Long after we have been gone from this song
Well, the afterlife sings one for me
Lost in the length of those warm-ass horizons
The afterlife knows where I'll be

[Bridge]
*scatting*

[Chorus]
Long after we have been gone from this song
Well, the afterlife sings one for me
Lost in the length of those warm-ass horizons
The afterlife knows where I'll be

[Post-Chorus]
Long after we have been gone from this song
There will be something to see
My mother said there will be some surprises
The afterlife shows them to me
