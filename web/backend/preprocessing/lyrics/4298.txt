41 ContributorsShe Lyrics[Verse 1]
She, she screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with a brick of self-control

[Chorus]
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm takin' heed just for you

[Verse 2]
She, she's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Wakin' up this time
To smash the silence with a brick of self-control

[Chorus]
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm takin' heed just for you
Yeah
