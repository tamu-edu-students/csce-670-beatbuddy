It's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch, I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets, I cover up my face

[Chorus]
I do
Love you
I do
Love you

[Verse 2]
And when you play guitar, I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet, I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you but saying it out loud
Is hard

[Bridge]
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long

[Outro]
But you are the life I needed all along
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb
And words are futile devicesYou might also like11Embed Futile Devices (Doveman Remix) Call Me By Your Name (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Sufjan Stevens songwriter
