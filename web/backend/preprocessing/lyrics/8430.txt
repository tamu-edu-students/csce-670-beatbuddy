She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

[Verse 1]
I've been feeling foolish, you should try it
She came and substituted the peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood flow concertina
Cheating heart beat, rapid fire

[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Here is your host, sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

[Verse 2]
She's been loop-the-looping around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me this kind of
Acrobatic blood concertina
Cheating heart beat, rapid fire

[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
You might also like[Bridge]
In an unusual place, when you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day

[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
