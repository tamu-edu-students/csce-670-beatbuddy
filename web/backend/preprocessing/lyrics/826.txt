Breakin' my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breakin' my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes, but don't blink, you might miss

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

[Chorus]
Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential

[Verse 2]
Ready, let's roll onto somethin' new
Takin' its toll then I'm leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushin', a-rushin' around

[Bridge]
Pace yourself for me (for me)
I said maybe, baby, please (please)
But I just don't know now (Maybe, baby)
When all I wanna do is try

[Chorus]
Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looks like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushin', a-rushin' around
Oh, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushin', a-rushin' around
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushin', a-rushin' around57Embed Somebody Told Me Hot Fuss The Killers alt-rock
