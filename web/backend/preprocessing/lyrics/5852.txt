You wet my eyes, but I don't mind it
I tell you lies, but it's only sometimes
You pick a fight and I'll define it
I swear that I

[Chorus]
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times
Don't think it was three times
Can't be more than four times
Think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
Didn't mean to two-time you, two-time you

[Verse]
She said that I, I shoulda liked it
I told her I only use it sometimes
Except when I, I need remindin'
I'm petrified

[Chorus]
But I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times
Don't think it was three times
Didn't mean to two-time you, two-time you

I tell you lies, but it's only sometimes
You pick a fight and I'll define it
I swear that I

[Chorus]
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times
Don't think it was three times
Can't be more than four times
Think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
Didn't mean to two-time you, two-time you

[Post-Chorus]
I two-time you, two-time you

[Chorus]
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times
Don't think it was three times
Can't be more than four times
Think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
Didn't mean to two-time, two-time you
[Post-Chorus]
Two-time you, two-time you55Embed
