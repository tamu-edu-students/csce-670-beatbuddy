Your love is king, crown you in my heart
Your love is king, never need to part
Your kisses ring, round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me, I'm crying out for more

[Chorus 2]
Your love is king, crown you in my heart
Your love is king, you're the ruler of my heart
Your kisses ring, round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
I'm crying out for more, your love is king

[Verse 1]
I'm coming on
I'm coming
You're making me dance

[Chorus 1]
Your love is king, crown you in my heart
Your love is king, never need to part
Your kisses ring, round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me, it's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me, I'm crying out for more
