Keep holding on
When my brain's ticking like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts
Have come again to get me
Sweet bitter words
Unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along, mockingbird
You don't affect me

[Refrain]
That's right
Deliver it to my heart
Please strike
Be deliberate (Deliberate)

[Chorus]
Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon, I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

Choke, choke again
I thought my demons were my friends
Pity me in the end
They're out to get me
Since I was young
I've tasted sorrow on my tongue
And the sweet sugar gun
Does not protect me

[Refrain]
That's right
Trigger between my eyes
Please strike
Make it quick now (Now)

[Chorus]
Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon, I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
[Bridge]
I'm trying to hold it together
Head is lighter than a feather
Looks like I'm not getting better
Not getting better

[Chorus]
Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon, I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate17Embed
