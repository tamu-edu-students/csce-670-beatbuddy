5 ContributorsShe Is Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been beaten down, I've been kicked around
But she takes it all for me
And I lost my faith, in my darkest days
But she makes me want to believe

[Chorus 1]
They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need

She's all I need

[Verse 2]
Well I had my ways, they were all in vain
But she waited patiently
It was all the same, all my pride and shame
And she put me on my feet

[Chorus]
[They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need

[Bridge]
And when that world slows down, dear
And when those stars burn out, here
Oh she'll be here, yes she'll be here

[They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need

[Chorus]
[They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need

[Chorus]
[They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need10Embed
