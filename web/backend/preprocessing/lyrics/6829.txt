26 ContributorsAngel Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
And the cryin' that I do is for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby

[Chorus]
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'm going to do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Without your love I'm nothing but a begger
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone
Baby

[Bridge]
You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
You're my a-a-a-angel
Come and save me tonight (Angel)
You're my a-a-a-angel
Come and take me all right
[Outro]
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight10Embed
