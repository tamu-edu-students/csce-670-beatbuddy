8 ContributorsMonday Mourning Lyrics[Hook:]

You may be gone but so what, say
Look what I've become, aye
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
You may be gone but so what, say
My life just begun, aye
Get out of my head
Get out of my head

[Verse:]

Ya you may be gone but so what
That life was never enough
I like to think we in love
But ain't got time for that stuff
My mind had told me to run
Like heard the sound of a gun
But I was tired enough
And closed my eyes for the love

Don't matter cause it's all over anyway
The same chatter back and forth that plague my mind like every day
Like how you leave a person so worthless just to stand in rain
And not expect the outcome of a million dollar renegade
You might also likeI stand the stage to tell you it's not over it's just started
Stand the test of time a broken mind will turn you to a Carter
I've been broken down and battered, speaking to the broken hearted
This ain't anything it's everything don't know what they just started

[Hook:]

You may be gone but so what, say
Look what I've become, aye
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
You may be gone but so what, say
My life just begun, aye
Get out of my head
Get out of my head2Embed
