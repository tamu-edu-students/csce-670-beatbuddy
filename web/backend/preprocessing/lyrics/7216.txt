If we die tonight, get buried next to me (Next to me)
I'm not afraid to cry, but I don't like it when you look at me
Don't look at me
Don't look at me
Don't look at me

[Verse]
I go where the wind blows, I can't let go
Baby, don't let go, don't wanna be alone
Girl, let's stay up (Stay up), don't wanna go home
Drugs make me feel alive, like there's nothing wrong
I go where the wind blows, I can't let go
Baby, don't let go, don't wanna be alone
Girl, let's stay up (Stay up), don't wanna go home
Drugs make me feel alive, like there's nothing wrong

[Chorus]
If we die tonight, get buried next to me (Next to me)
I'm not afraid to cry, but I don't like it when you look at me
Don't look at me

[Bridge]
Don't wanna go home
Stay up
Don't wanna go home
Stay up
Don't wanna go home
Stay up, stay up
Don't wanna go home
