We're only making plans for Nigel
We only want what's best for him
We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel just needs that helping hand

[Chorus]
And if young Nigel says he's happy
He must be happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his world

We're only making plans for Nigel
He has his future in a British Steel
We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel's whole future is as good as sealed, yeah

[Chorus]
And if young Nigel says he's happy
He must be happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his world

But he likes to speak
And he likes to be spoken to

Nigel is happy in his work
(in his world)
Nigel is happy in his work
