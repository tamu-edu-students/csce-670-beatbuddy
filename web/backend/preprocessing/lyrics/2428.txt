We
We don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights started out
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shinin' up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire

[Chorus]
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave, no
We just wanna be right now, right, ri-ri-right now
And what we see
Is everybody's on the floor, actin' crazy, gettin' loco till the lights out
Music's on, I'm waking up
We start the fire, then we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love
There's no sleepin' now, no sleepin' now, sleepin' now

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights started out
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shinin' up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire

[Chorus]
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
When the lights started out
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
[Post-Chorus]
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn (Ooh)
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn (Ooh)

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
