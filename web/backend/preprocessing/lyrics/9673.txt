73 ContributorsTranquility Base Hotel & Casino Lyrics[Verse 1]
Jesus in the day spa, filling out the information form
Mama got her hair done, just popping out to sing a protest song
I've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
Where I ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Verse 2]
This magical thinking feels as if it really might catch on
Mama wants some answers
Do you remember where it all went wrong?
Technological advances really bloody get me in the mood
Pull me in close on a crisp eve, baby
Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

[Chorus]
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?
You might also like[Bridge]
And do you celebrate your dark side
Then wish you'd never left the house?
Have you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?25Embed Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino Arctic Monkeys garage
