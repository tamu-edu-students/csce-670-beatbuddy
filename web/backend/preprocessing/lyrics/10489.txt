20 ContributorsPhilophobia Lyrics[Chorus: Lil Rae & Isekai]
I wanna penthouse suite with a view (Yah, yah)
I wanna cute girl who gon' stick to me like glue (Like glue)
I wanna zoom-zoom through the night in a coupe (Zoom-zoom)
I want the whole world and the stars too (Stars too)
I wanna bad bitch who can fuck me all night (Night)
When I'm in the darkness, she can be my light (Yeah)
I wanna double cup, yeah, fill it up with Sprite  (Sprite)
Wanna get fucked up to help me through the night

[Verse 1: Isekai]
Popping molly, yeah, I'm tryna get high (Yeah)
She's grabbing on my dick when I'm dancing at night
I be making moves, yeah, I know I'm gonna die (Die)
Girlie, I'm young, I'm just living my life (Yeah)
Taking my time, yeah, I'm a bit confused (Yeah, yeah)
Playing games, baby girl, tell me something new (New)
She's calling me the plug 'cause I dick her down at two
Think I broke your heart? Bitch, it's just a flesh wound (Yeah, yeah)
Pull up in a drop-top, she hit my line
I can't fuck with you, I ain't got no time
You ain't even main, girl, you was just a side (Side)
Yeah, yeah, you was just a side
See, I need to (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck with you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you love me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I don't love you

[Verse 2: Lil Rae]
Yeah, my head's still spinnin' (Yah)
Tried to pull me over, but I'm still winnin' (What)
Tried to pull me down, but now I'm singin' (Okay)
Step back and watch, this is just the beginnin' (Yeah)
Touched by the gods at birth (Yah, yah, ayy)
Meant for the heavens, but I'm stuck in Earth (Yah, yah, ayy)
Seconds not an option, gotta come first (Yah, yah, ayy)
I want that gold, gotta quench my thirst
Yeah, I got a brand new bitch for the ride (Yah)
Last girl should've never lied (Yah)
Steal yo' girl, yeah, I tried (Ouu)
Run boy, but you can't hide (Nah, nah, ayy)
Damn, I'm blowin' up like I'm Broly (Like I'm Broly)
Frostbite on my wrist from the Rollie (From the Rollie)
Shut the fuck up, boy, you don't know me (You don't know me)
Shut the fuck up, boy, you a phony
