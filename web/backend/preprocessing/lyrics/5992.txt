4 ContributorsTo All The Boys I’ve Loved Before Lyrics[Chorus]
Shout out to all the boys I've loved before
For teaching me I needed more
I'm kinda glad they broke my heart
'Cause now its yours

[Verse 1]
I loved two guys from Connecticut
With two closets full of skeletons
And I couldn't be a therapist for them
And I loved a kid from Hollywood
But he cheated on me 'cause he could
And I went full Carrie Underwood on him

[Pre-Chous]
Uh, uh, uh
I love the shit they put me through
Because it led me to you
I kissed a lot of frogs to get to the princе

[Chorus]
Shout out to all the boys I've loved bеfore
For teaching me I needed more
I'm kinda glad they broke my heart
'Cause now it's yours (Now it's yours)
Shout out to all the boys I've loved before
For all the fucking drama I endured
But now I don't cry anymore 'cause
You're nothing like the boys I've loved before
Hahaha
You might also like[Verse 2]
I loved someone from New Jersey
But he really, really hurt me
'Cause it weirdly made him happy to see me sad
But you're from Arizona
Oh my God, I love Sedona
You even made Corona not so bad

[Pre-Chous]
Uh, uh, uh
I love the shit they put me through
Because it led me to you
I kissed a lot of frogs to get to the prince

[Chorus]
Shout out to all the boys I've loved before
For teaching me I needed more
I'm kinda glad they broke my heart
'Cause now it's yours (Now it's yours)
Shout out to all the boys I've loved before
For all the fucking drama I endured
But now I don't cry anymore 'cause
You're nothing like the boys I've loved before
Hahaha

[Bridge]
Shout out to all the boys I've loved before
For teaching me I needed more
I lost a battle, not the war
'Cause now I'm yours
Hey, hey
[Chorus]
Shout out to all the boys I've loved before
For teaching me I needed more
I'm kinda glad they broke my heart
'Cause now it's yours (Now it's yours) (Yeah)
Shout out to all the boys I've loved before
For all the fucking drama I endured
But now I don't cry anymore 'cause (Hey, hey)
You're nothing like the boys (Woah) I've loved before
