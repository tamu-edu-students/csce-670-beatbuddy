27 ContributorsA Grave Mistake Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here lies the lifeless bride and groom
"Till death do us part" came far too soon
Buildings burn and people die all of the time

[Pre-Chorus]
But I heard that you reap what you sow
So, around and around we go
And when you see my face, you'll know

[Chorus]
You can't save yourself
Or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With weathered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen flies the crow
You can't save yourself

[Verse 2]
These vengeful thoughts trapped underneath
Rage, scorn, misery
Payback for what you took from me:
Hope, love, sanity

[Pre-Chorus]
I've heard that you reap what you sow
So, here's to believing in ghosts
Now when you see my face, you'll know

You can't save yourself
Or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With weathered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen flies the crow

[Bridge]
No forgiveness, just farewell
From the match made in heaven
You sent straight to hell
No forgiveness, no escape
May you rest in pieces
For your grave mistake
For your grave mistake

[Chorus]
You can't save yourself
Or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With weathered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen flies the crow
You can't save yourself

[Outro]
No, you can't save yourself
For your grave mistake
You can't save yourself8Embed
