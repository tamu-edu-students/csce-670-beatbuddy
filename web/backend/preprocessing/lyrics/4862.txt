I can't seem to find someone's shoulder
Who will I rely on when it's over?
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over

[Verse]
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?

[Outro]
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
My worth, my worthYou might also like105Embed
