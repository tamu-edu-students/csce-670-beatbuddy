44 ContributorsParty We Will Throw Now Lyrics[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Verse 1: The Game]
Yeah, all I need is the chronic to keep me fit
A bad bitch, a project apartment and 2 pits
Red chucks, a red Bic to keep my kush lit
Thank god for what I get but never really needed shit
I'm a hustler nigga, that's how I got this red Bentley
Slay the competition and told them that Dre sent me
Walk through the smoke like, "what up loc"
Cause Warren got that bomb that kind that make me choke
We gonna twist up 8 for Nate, blow the smoke through the clouds
In hopes that it reaches the pearly gates
Now, how many niggas wanna throw up a dub
And be surrounded by the baddest bitches up in the club, yeah
It's the 'math blood, sixes on the ave cuz
Phantom got your girl pussy wetter than my bathtub
Fuck her all night, wake her up at 6
Lil mama grab your shit, get ghost
You might also like[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Verse 2: Warren G]
Click-clack what up, zig-zag run up
Knick-knack paddywhack, twisting up a fat sack
Tic tac toe up, I be in them streets like an
Intersection, I got connections, from every section
Critical, political, it's killer Cal'
Roll it up, now pass that shit around
My mental is cynical, original
Thinking you could see us, I'm like nigga how?
I'm in that diamond lane, I'm in that diamond chain
Glistenin', glowin', I'm sippin' liquor I'm blowin' zippers
My nigga, I'm on one, I'm twistin' the zone up
I'm sitting up low, my pistol shinin' my chrome up
My nigga Game got the gun load, one shot
Mix a nigga brain like some gumbo, uh, oh
All that tough talk nigga, what for?
Shut your scary ass up at the front door
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

[Verse 3: Warren G]
Couldn't, nobody diss my nigga
Damn I miss my nigga, pour out a little liquor
Big Nate Dogg nigga, 2-1-3
From the city by the sea, where them Gs ride
Turn around baby let me listen to the b-side
Slap that, tap that, after that, East side
As I travel this road I see the street sign
Ready for whatever, Beretta's you know I keep mine

[Verse 4: The Game]
It's the L-B, C-P-T nigga we be
OG to BG, that's where the weed be
Killer (what?) Cali-forni-a
Eh, load the strap, hop into the six-trey
Snoop, what up loc?, I'm headed to the East side
G ride, throwin' up everything but the peace sign
Gold Daytonas, gangbang persona
Nigga trip, I'ma pop the top off his Corolla
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
