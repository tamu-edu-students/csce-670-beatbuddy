4 ContributorsSunbeams LyricsSunbeam (x5)

(I don't wanna climb)

I don't wanna climb down
I see those sunbeams grow
Turn our breath in to gold
My eyes burst in to-
I don't wanna climb down
I see those sunbeams grow
Turn our breath in to gold
My eyes burst in to smoke

Been a while but I'm up with a new blade
Fuck around to get cut metal blue grade tin
Nah you can't hang and you can't sit
Base jumpin' off all of these fan bases
Flames under the pot
Brain's out of our stock, oh god there's-
Some precious stones in her headdress
Sunbeam sword still burns inside scent
Sees rainbow refraction on seashells
From the diamonds I draped on my ego
New warp drive inside of my vehicle
Goes right through time and I manage to speak slow
I'm dumb always half awake, noddin'
Rockin' chain with some cash impaled on it
Pop a roll [?] with my mind if I concentrate hard and I do the impossible, what?
I'm droppin' a glacier inside of my cup
Shotgun an ocean I'll find that we buds, son
Bathe for an hour inside of the sun-
Crush moons into powder and spice up my lungs, uh
You can feel fire and try not to be so wired my eyes are fumin'-
Osiris is typin' to me through Skype and I try to mute him. (Bleh)

Now wherever might lounge
I don't wanna climb down
Douse the sun, turn lights out (x2)

I don't wanna climb down
I see those sunbeams grow
Turn our breath in to gold
My eyes burst in to-
I don't wanna climb down
I see those sunbeams grow
Turn our breath (yuh) in to (yuh) gold
My eyes burst in to smoke

Sunbeam sword stands, Hyperion
I never fall off like why were we on this
Planet ignore phone calls from Norse gods
I think I got heat stroke I'm fallin' asleep
Drinkin' to genies out bottles I'll need no rocks-
I'm ridin a wave
I was mentorin' Kubrick outside of the frame
Inhaling the fumes above Saturn and-
Painting on Pluto, the logo of OTJ
I'm gassed up, no sunscreen watch-
My own flesh fall off, fuck me
Braggadocio rappers inside of the truck
I'm an Aston Martin DB double 1 like-
See what I did there, rationale ensnare
Glitz and glamour, live life with a lens flare
Like shit I'm ignorant, how do I climb down I'm sick of this
Precipice, I'm convinced I'm the shit
But under this skin? I'm dead
Exaggeration patent pending
Bask a case of fans of flames you
Try to 'scape and ones that cause
Phantom pains and flood the senses
No acclimations, sorry

I don't wanna climb down
Now wherever might lounge
I don't wanna climb down
Douse the sun, turn lights out
I don't wanna climb down
Now wherever might lounge
I don't wanna climb down
Douse the sun...

I don't wanna climb down
I see those sunbeams grow
Turn our breath in to gold
My eyes burst in to-
I don't wanna climb down
I see those sunbeams grow
Turn our breath in to gold
My eyes burst in to smoke1Embed
