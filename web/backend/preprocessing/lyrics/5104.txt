Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?

[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said, “You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away”
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

[Chorus: The Who]
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back, and I hiccuped and looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God, there's got to be another way

[Chorus: The Who]
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on, tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

[Bridge: Townshend & Entwistle]
Who are you?
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh

[Chorus: The Who]
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who  are you?
Who, who, who, who?
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on, tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

[Outro: The Who]
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me whoa are you (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me, tell me, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on, come on, who? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, tell me who are you (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really wanna know
Oh, I really wanna know
Come on, tell me, who are you, you, you, you?
Who are you?8Embed Who Are You Who Are You The Who hard-rock
