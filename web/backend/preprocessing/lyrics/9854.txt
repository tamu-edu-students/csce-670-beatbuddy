Ain't had my medicine in over a week
My mind's fine but my body feels weak
Call the doctor, I think I'm sick

A shady lady took all my bread
Ravished my body, lord, and messed with my head
I don't know but I've had my fill
Call the doctor and tell him I'm ill

My money's gone and I've got no place to go
I don't believe I've ever felt so low
If you've got the time while you hang around
Call the doctor and tell him I'm downYou might also like1Embed
