22 ContributorsAgainst the Wind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely
She was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness
With the radio playin' low, and
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn
And nothing left to prove

[Pre-Chorus]
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me, oh-so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

[Chorus]
Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

[Verse 2]
And the years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home and I
I guess I lost my way
There were oh-so many roads
I was livin' to run
And runnin' to live
Never worried about payin'
Or even how much I owed
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Movin' eight miles a minute
For months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

[Chorus]
Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

[Piano and Guitar Duet: Paul Harris and Drew Abbott]

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in
What to leave out

[Chorus]
Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
I'm older now but still running against the wind
Well, I'm older now and still running
Against the wind
[Outro]
Against the wind
(Against the wind)
I'm still running
(Against the wind)
I'm still running against the wind
(Against the wind)
I'm still running
(Against the wind)
I'm still running against the wind
(Against the wind)
Still running
(Against the wind)
Running against the wind, running against the wind
(Against the wind)
See the young man run
(Against the wind)
Watch the young man run
(Against the wind)
Watch the young man runnin'
(Against the wind)
He'll be runnin' against the wind
(Against the wind)
Let the cowboys ride
(Against the wind)
Unh
(Against the wind)
Let the cowboys ride
(Against the wind)
They'll be ridin' against the wind
(Against the wind)
Against the wind
(Against the wind)
Ridin' against the wind
(Against the wind)
(Against the wind)
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
(Against the wind)2Embed Against The Wind Against The Wind Bob Seger hard-rock
