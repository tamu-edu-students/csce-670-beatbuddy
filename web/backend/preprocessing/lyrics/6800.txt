Kiss me slowly while I'm sitting in the backseat
Head is spinnin' and I never felt so happy
Driver's talkin' but we don't hear what he saying
City lights are so blurry, everything is fading

[Bridge: Aleyna Tilki]
I want somebody, want some real love
I just want some real love
I just want some real love
Baby, I want somebody, want some real love
I just want some real love
I just wanna' real love

[Pre-Chorus: Aleyna Tilki]
I want somebody, want somebody, —body
I just want some real love
I just want some real love
Baby, I want somеbody, want somebody, —body
I just want some real lovе
I just wanted real love baby

[Chorus: Aleyna Tilki]
I want somebody, want somebody, —body
I just want some real love
I just want some real love
Baby, I want somebody, want somebody, —body
I just want some real love
I just want a real love
