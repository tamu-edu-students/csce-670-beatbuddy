22 ContributorsFEEL NOTHING Lyrics[Verse 1]
Before I say another word
Just know that my intentions were pure
But you can't stand to be in silence
All you can hear is your own voice
Fueling delusion in you and I'm just
So sick of backing down that I might just spill it all
And if I do you won't be coming back without a deep scar in your soul
Are you not sick of playing games? Sick of giving blame?
Sick of fucking living like the world has never given you a life-defining day?
And I can't relate

[Chorus]
And I feel nothing for you
I feel nothing for you
And I feel
It's too late, too late
I've buried this and it's evident
You won't change, won't change
I feel nothing

[Verse 2]
My mind is torn
I hate it but I long to feel what I felt before
But you just keep moving towards me
What do I do? What do I say?
Can you kindly just refrain
What's here for me, why hide the truth?
You might also like[Chorus]
That I feel nothing for you
I feel nothing for you
And I feel
It's too late, too late
I've buried this and it's evident
You won't change, won't change
(I feel nothing for you)

[Bridge]
Broke away but you're starving for closure
Seam together but you know that I know ya
Know this is real, this is real

[Chorus]
It's too late, too late
I've buried this and it's evident
You won't change, won't change
I feel
It's too late, too late
I've buried this and it's evident
You won't change, won't change
That I feel nothing for you
I feel nothing for you
And I feel12Embed FEEL NOTHING DISPOSE The Plot In You metal
