68 ContributorsToday Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out

[Verse 1]
I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

[Chorus 2]
Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

[Verse 2]
Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings
You might also like[Chorus 3]
Today is
Today is
Today is
The greatest day, ooh
Ooh, oh, oh, ooh

[Bridge]
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you

[Outro]
Today is the greatest
Today is the greatest day
Today is the greatest day
That I have ever really known27Embed
