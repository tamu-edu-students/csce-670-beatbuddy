4 ContributorsStylin’ Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy
Look

[Verse 1]
Ain't really much in the hood these days
I'm tryna get me paid
10 racks can really do good these days
Keep my packs all laid
This baddie wanna link and talk 'bout dates
She don't know mans face
I know that my links back home wanna see man paid
And I know that's great
Cah, I know I'm gonna keep it a hunna
All damn summer
Your guy can't flex like me what a bummer
If your guy need work he can come do runner
Need a YS chain for my YS stunners
On a date with bird tryna cop some hummus
But I need a big whip tryna flex that Hummer
Checks for my team, gotta split with my brother
Gotta check on my dukes, drop a check for my mother

[Chorus]
In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain't even been driving, no license
But I been gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now I'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding?
In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain't even been driving, no license
But I been gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now I'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding?

Took a stop off for tea
Ain't really much with the G's
Bro got himself a new B
Her drop on fleek
Know that her boy on T
She don't take calls on E
Never post on the feed
Know that my link can't leak
Don't bite the hand that feeds
Double up on speed
Bro's been out OT
Might never come back lowkey
I was out with the bro on a pedal bike cruising through ends
When my bro got a text on his phone
Told the plug bring 10 with a medal back flex
Hit my darg on a text then post by the home
Never tell when a check finna pop on mans phone
If a snake try call leave a message at tone
I ain't ever took drugs but check out my flex
If you watch man step when I'm outta my zone

[Chorus]
In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain't even been driving, no license
But I been gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now I'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding?
In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain't even been driving, no license
But I been gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now I'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding?1Embed
