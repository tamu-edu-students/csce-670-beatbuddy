Teardrops

[Verse 1: Oliver Sykes]
We hurt ourselves for fun
Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb
Addicted to a lonely kind of love
What I wanna know

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
Is how we got this stressed out, paranoid?
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

[Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

[Verse 2: Oliver Sykes]
I'm tripping on the edge
High as a kite, I'm never coming down
And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels
To be alone
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
So how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid?
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

[Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

[Bridge: Oliver Sykes]
Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ
Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ

[Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think
