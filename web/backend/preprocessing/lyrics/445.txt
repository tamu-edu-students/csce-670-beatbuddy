(Rock Mafia)

[Verse 1]
It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on with the best of 'em
You are beautiful
Like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want you to know, baby

[Chorus]
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

Constantly
Boy, you play through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me what you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free
I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful, you are

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want you to know, baby

[Chorus]
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you, I love you)
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (Like a love song)

[Bridge]
No one compares
You stand alone to every record I own
Music to my heart, that's what you are (Ba-ba-baby)
A song that goes on and on (And on)
[Chorus]
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you like a song)
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (Like a love, oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you)
