If you wanna hang out
You've got to take her out
Cocaine
If you wanna get down
Down on the ground
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

[Verse 2]
If you've got bad news
You wanna kick them blues
Cocaine
When your day is done
And you wanna run
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

[Verse 3]
If your day is gone
And you wanna ride on
Cocaine
Don't forget this fact
You can't get it back
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
