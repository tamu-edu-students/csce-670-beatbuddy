20 ContributorsDiamond Eyes (Boom-Lay Boom-Lay Boom) Lyrics[Intro]
I am the shadow, and the smoke in your eyes
I am the ghost, that hides in the night

Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom

[Verse 1]
Wait, wait a minute take a step back
You gotta think twice before you react
So stay, stay a little while
'Cause a promise not kept is the road to exile
Hey! What's the circumstance
You'll never be great without taking a chance so
Wait, you waited too long
Had your hands in your pocket
When you shoulda been gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
One push is all you'll need
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
A fist first philosophy
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
We watch with wounded eyes
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
So I hope you recognize

I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regret
And now I see the world through diamond eyes

[Verse 2]
Damn! Damn it all down
Took one to the chest without even a sound
So... What! What are you worth?
The things you love or the people you hurt
Hey! It's like deja vu
A suicidal maniac with nothing to lose
So... wait, it's the exception to the rule
Everyone of us is expendable

[Pre-Chorus]
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
One push is all you'll need
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
A fist first philosophy
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
We watch with wounded eyes
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom
So I hope you recognize
[Chorus]
I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regret
And now I know that I'm alive
I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regret
And now I see the world through diamond eyes

[Bridge]
Every night of my life
I watch angels fall from the sky
Every time that the sun still sets
I pray they don't take mine

[Chorus]
I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to regret
[Chorus]
I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regret
And now I know that I'm alive
I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regret
And now I see the world through diamond eyes

[Chorus]
I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness
So long to the regret
And now I see the world through diamond eyes
