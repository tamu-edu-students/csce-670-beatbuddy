Through benediction
You tried to rid your mind of malediction
But through all this time you try to peel it off
And it's such a ride
Your desolation
Led you into this vile incarnation
Of consummated bliss I know you need it now
To make you feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
All your faith, all your rage, all your pain
It ain't over now and I ain't talking about forgiveness
All your faith, all your rage, all your pain
It ain't over now

[Chorus]
It's the cruel beast that you feed
It's your burning yearning need to bleed
Through the spillways
(Spillways)

[Verse 2]
You keep a casket
Buried deep within, you try to mask it
But fall back in sin, you wanna shake it off
But you're stuck inside
When stripped of rags of skin and spine
Human decay, Corpus Dei
Terminally dispelled
And it's such a ride
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
All your faith, all your rage, all your pain
It ain't over now and I ain't talking about forgiveness
All your faith, all your rage, all your pain
It ain't ovеr now

[Chorus]
It's the cruel beast that you feed
It's your burning yеarning need to bleed
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
(Spillways, spillways)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
It's the cruel beast that you feed
It's your burning yearning need to bleed
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul4Embed Spillways IMPERA Ghost metal
