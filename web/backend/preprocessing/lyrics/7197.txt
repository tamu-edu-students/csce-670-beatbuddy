6 ContributorsParasite Lyrics[Verse 1: Kevin Ratajczak]
I can feel it taking over
All my senses getting slower
And every part of your dead mind is me
But you're gonna be the one too blind to see

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kevin Ratajczak]
I cannot take it, you started taking me in
I cannot take it, you wanna bury me, bury me
I would rip you off like a Band-Aid on my knee
But you hold on tight, you're a part of me

[Chorus: Nico Sallach, Kevin Ratajczak]
We struggled all the way and it was still okay
But I lost it when you got into my head
You and me forever
You're like a parasite but you keep me alive
And I can hear you say "We're gonna be okay"
I know you're lying, but the truth is what I fear
You and mе forever
You're likе a parasite, I really need you to stay

[Verse 2: Kevin Ratajczak]
I can feel it taking over
All my senses getting slower
And all you see is an illusion of truth
It will make you believe you got nothing to lose
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2: Kevin Ratajczak]
You cannot take it, I'm crawling under your skin
You cannot take it, you gotta carry me, carry me
I will make you mine, you can run but you can't hide
And I will push you down, you better give in to me

[Chorus: Nico Sallach, Kevin Ratajczak]
We struggled all the way and it was still okay
But I lost it when you got into my head
You and me forever
You're like a parasite but you keep me alive
And I can hear you say "We're gonna be okay"
I know you're lying, but the truth is what I fear
You and me forever
You're like a parasite, I really need you to stay

[Bridge: Kevin Ratajczak]
I can feel it taking over
All my senses getting slower
I see you fighting but I'm letting you know
I don't lurk in the dark but I'm already here with you

[Breakdown: Kevin Ratajczak]
And I'll never say goodbye
'Cause I'm feeding on your sadness
Your nightmares, your dirty little soul
Your pain is my pleasure, you feel me everywhere you go
There's no way to hide, I will find you
And every time that you think I'm not with you
I will push you into deep, you are dead but alive
[Chorus: Nico Sallach, Kevin Ratajczak]
We struggled all the way and it was still okay
But I lost it when you got into my head
You and me forever
You're like a parasite but you keep me alive
And I can hear you say "We're gonna be okay"
I know you're lying, but the truth is what I fear
You and me forever
You're like a parasite, I really need you to stayEmbed
