I'm a dumb teen boy, I eat sticks and rocks and mud
I don't care about the government, and I really need a hug
I feel stupid (Stupid), ugly (Ugly), pretend it doesn't bother me
I'm not very strong, but I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs

[Verse 2]
It's getting cold down here underneath the weather
I skipped class to sit with you, I really like your spotty sweater
If ladybugs are girls, how do you make kids together?
What's it like in a female world? I bet it's just so much better

[Pre-Chorus]
I just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean

[Chorus]
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be?
Though it isn't me, boys will be bugs, right?

[Post-Chorus]
Boys will be bugs, right?

I'm a dumb teen boy, all I wanna do is quit
My mum told me that she's worried and I couldn't give a shit
I have friends who understand me, their names are spider, beetle, bee
They don't say much, but they have always listened to me

[Verse 4]
The other boys at school think it's cool to hate your parents
But they're lyin' all the time, the bugs advised that I should let 'em
And if you wanna cry, make sure that they never see it
Or even better yet, block it out and never feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
I just turned fourteen
And I think I know everything

[Chorus]
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be?
Though it isn't me, boys will be bugs, right?

[Post-Chorus]
Boys will be bugs, right?
[Bridge]
Just turned fourteen and I think this year I'm gonna be mean
(Just turned fourteen and I think I know everything)
Just turned fourteen and I think this year I'm gonna be mean
(Just turned fourteen and I think the world revolves around me)

[Chorus]
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be?
Though it isn't me, boys will be bugs, right?

[Outro]
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be?
Though it isn't me, boys will be bugs, right?48Embed
