Hangin' out where I don't belong
Is nothing new to me
I get tired and I get sick
And then I lose the strength to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't handle change
I can't handle change

[Chorus]
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good

[Bridge]
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wanna go home now)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wanna go home now)

"I know it's not your fault"
Still lately I begin to shake
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all74Embed I Can't Handle Change I Can't Handle Change Roar indie
