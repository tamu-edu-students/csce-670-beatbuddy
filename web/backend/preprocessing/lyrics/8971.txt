17 ContributorsWatch Over You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Leaves are on the ground
Fall has come
Blue skies turning grey
Like my love
I tried to carry you
And make you whole
But it was never enough
I must go

[Chorus]
And who is gonna save you
When I'm gone?
And who'll watch over you
When I'm gone?

[Verse 2]
You say you care for me
But hide it well
How can you love someone
And not yourself?
[Chorus]
And who is gonna save you
When I'm gone?
And who'll watch over you
When I'm gone?
You might also like[Bridge]
And when I'm gone
Who will break your fall?
Who will you blame?
I can't go on
And let you lose it all
It's more than I can take
Who'll ease your pain?
Ease your pain
[Chorus]
And who is gonna save you when I'm gone?
And who'll watch over you?
And who will give you strength when you're not strong?
Who'll watch over you when I've gone away?

[Outro]
Snow is on the ground
Winter's come
You long to hear my voice
But I'm long gone3Embed
