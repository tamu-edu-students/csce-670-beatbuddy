[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Interlude]
[Bridge: Pete Townshend]
Don't cry, don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
Sally, take my hand, we'll travel south 'cross land
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here, the happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older

[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
Teenage wasteland, it's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland, oh, yeah
Teenage wasteland
They're all wasted
