3 ContributorsHurt U Lyrics[Verse 1]
Think I met you 'fore I met myself
You were laughing I was scared as hell
Think my jokes are better now, can't tell (Can't tell)
I can never tell
Thought it'd be another weekend thing
I was focused on my sleep and daydreams
But you hit me like a shot of caffeine
Yeah, you woke me up

[Chorus]
Morning dripping through your broke blinds
Bedside, come and kiss me
With your sleep eyes (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Nothing I would ever do (Do-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
To hurt you

[Verse 2]
Know how much it took to let me in
Know commitment can be hit or miss
Never want to need a second chance
No, I never do, for you, I'll be bulletproof

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you gave me your heart I could break it
But it tears me apart just to say it
Like falling from empire state to the pavement
No, I couldn't face it, no
You might also like[Chorus]
Morning dripping through your broke blinds
Bedside, come and kiss me
With your sleep eyes (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Nothing I would ever do (Do-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
To lose the way you
Trust me with your secrets
Pillow talking
Wanna stay like this like (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Nothing I would ever do (Do-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
To hurt you

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, you know, yeah, you know
You're my favorite
To hurt you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
Think I met you before I met myself
Kinda feels like I was someone else
You gave everything that I never felt
Ooh, no I never felt

[Chorus]
Morning dripping through your broke blinds
Bedside, come and kiss me
With your sleep eyes (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Nothing I would ever do (Do-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
To lose the way you
Trust me with your secrets
Pillow talking
Wanna stay like this like (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Nothing I would ever do (Do-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
To hurt you
[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, you know, yeah, you know
You're my favorite
Hurt you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, you know, yeah, you know
You're my favoriteEmbed
