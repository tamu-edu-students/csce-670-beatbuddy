Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speakin'
Ha ha ha ha ha, oh you sweet thing
Do I what?
Will I what?
Oh baby, you know what I like

Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a pony tail a-hangin' down
That wiggle in the walk
And giggle in the talk
Makes the world go 'round
There ain't nothin' in the world
Like a big-eyed girl
That makes me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose, like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby, that's what I like

What's that baby?
But...but...but...
Oh honey
But?
Oh baby, you know what I like

Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a pony tail a-hangin' down
That wiggle in the walk
And giggle in the talk
Makes the world go 'round, round, round
There ain't nothin' in the world
Like a big-eyed girl
That makes me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose, like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby, that's what I like
You might also likeWhat's that, honey?
Pick you up at eight, and don't be late?
But, baby, I ain't got no money, honey
Ha ha ha ha
Oh, all right, honey, you know what I like

Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a pony tail a-hangin' down
That wiggle in the walk
And giggle in the talk
Makes the world go 'round
There ain't nothin' in the world
Like a big-eyed girl
That makes me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose, like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby, that's what I likeEmbed Chantilly Lace Chantilly Lace The Big Bopper rockabilly
