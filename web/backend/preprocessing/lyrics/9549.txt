6 ContributorsHead Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lately I've been feeling so alone
Can someone give the antidote to me so I can
Finally understand where I belong
The world outside to me is like an ocean and I

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't swim
I'm losing my grip
Caught up in the current
Won't drown in this ship
I can't swim
I'm starting to slip
I'm running out of breath, I'm scared to death

[Chorus]
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up above the water
Gotta keep my head up up up up
I'm never going under, never going under
As long as air's in my lungs
Blood's in my veins
I'm not going down this way
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up abovе the water

If I hit the bottom will I brеak?
Cause I've been there before a million times but I don't
Know how much more of this I can take
I'm at the surface, what is my purpose?
It's making me nervous, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't swim
I'm losing my grip
Caught up in the current
Won't drown in this ship
I can't swim
I'm starting to slip
I'm running out of breath, I'm scared to death

[Chorus]
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up above the water
Gotta keep my head up up up up
I'm never going under, never going under
As long as air's in my lungs
Blood's in my veins
I'm not going down this way
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up above the water
[Bridge]
Holding on, still holding on
How'd it get so deep? Yeah
Holding on, still holding on
How'd it get so deep? Yeah
Holding on, still holding on
I'm running out of breath, I'm scared to death

[Chorus]
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up above the water
Gotta keep my head up up up up
I'm never going under, never going under
As long as air's in my lungs
Blood's in my veins
I'm not going down this way
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up above the water1Embed
