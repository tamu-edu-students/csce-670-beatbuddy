10 ContributorsAll I Know Lyrics[Whistled Intro]
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da

[Verse 1]
I don't think that I'm crazy
Yeah, but how would I know?
When the voices remind me
That it's all just for show
Well, I thought I had answers
But the questions have changed
It's so hard to feel anything
When I've only known pain (Pain)
Pain

[Chorus]
You can cast me out and
Dig my hole
Spit on my grave
Curse my soul
You can hold me down and
Not let go
But the devil you fear
Is all I know
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da

And the road that's less traveled
Well, it's all that I've known
Every time I look backwards
There's still so far to go
If I'm born to be broken
Cold, bloody, and numb
Tell me, why am I runnin'?
What am I running from? (From)
From

[Chorus]
You can cast me out and
Dig my hole
Spit on my grave
Curse my soul
You can hold me down and
Not let go
But the devil you fear
Is all I've ever, all I've ever, all I've ever known

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
As I sit here in silence
All alone in myself
Who the hell would believe me?
Better yet, who'd I tell?
I can tell
[Chorus]
You can cast me out and
Dig my hole
Spit on my grave
Curse my soul
You can hold me down and
Not let go
But the devil you fear
Is all I've known
