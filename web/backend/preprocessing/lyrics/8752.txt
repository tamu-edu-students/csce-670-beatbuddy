3 ContributorsSummer Playlist (2015) LyricsFinding good music can be a challenge. With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'

Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!
