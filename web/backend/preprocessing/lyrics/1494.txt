I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 3]
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me11Embed
