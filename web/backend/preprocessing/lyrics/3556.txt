[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey, you, out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey, you, standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey, you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Hey, you, out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey, you with your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Hey, you, out there on the road, always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey, you, out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey, you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
