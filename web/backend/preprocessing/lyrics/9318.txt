4 ContributorsI Hate Myself And Want To Die - 2013 Mix Lyrics[Intro: Dave Grohl & Kurt Cobain]
–from this por– this... porno movie, porno movie called 'You've Said a Mouthful' and this guy... has a hand shoved up his ass, and this lady's shoving it up his ass and he's going "Ow ow ow! Ow, ow, ow! Don't take it out. Ow, ahh!"
*clears throat and chuckles*

[Verse 1]
Running nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill

[Chorus 1]
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?

End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?

[Verse 2]
Broken heart and broken bones
Finger plaster cast and horse pills
One more quirky cliché phrase
You're the one I wanna refill
You might also like[Chorus 2]
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?

End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?

[Bridge]
Words are broken lives. Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws, can make a child look like a deer

[Chorus 3]
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?

End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?

[Verse 3]
Running nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill
[Chorus 4]
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?

End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?Embed
