2 ContributorsWe Don’t Study Cuz We All Get 5's LyricsChorus
Don’t worry (muthafricka), this isn’t a lie
We don’t study (muthafricka) cuz we all get 5’s (hit me again!)
Don’t worry (muthafricka), this isn’t a lie
We don’t study (muthafricka) cuz we all get 5’s (aww stuff, boi)

Unit 1
I said a psy-cho-logy a ly a ly I said a psy psy-cho-logy
I said a psy-cho-logy a ly a ly I said a psy psy-cho-logy
Now Meyer’s psychology is a big book
And to learn it all’s gonna take a long look
But that don’t mean learning can’t be fun
Cuz we're gunna start from unit one

Let’s start with empiricism, Franky Bacon
That means that you need to use experimentation
Wilhelm Wundt made the first laboratory
Introspection helped us learn the brain’s story
James wondered how our minds help us survive
He made the school of fuctionalism, about staying alive
Experimental psych at first it caused a schism
Watson, Skinner, Rayner, muthafrickin behaviorism
Humanistic and neuroscience, too
But let’s talk about the nature-nurture issue
Are your traits due to your genes
Or to the things your eyes have seen?
Why are levels of analysis important?
Biopsychosocial approach is cooler than jordans
Biological, social, psychodynamic
Behavioral, cognitive, chillin in a hammock
And it goes on n’ n’ on and on on n’ on
Psychology don’t stop until the break of dawn
Ya got the psychometrics, research, and developmental, too
Researchers as cool as the boiz in my crew!
Educational, personality, social, applied research
Making more dirty bills than the Catholic church
You best believe I’m not done with this info
Because I’m gunna the talk about something called I/O
Let’s not forget counseling and human factors
Nicholas Cages is my favorites actor
Clinical, and psychiatry
I guess I’m done with this unit, let’s study psychology
You might also likeUnit 2
Hindsight bias? What’s that?
I was always right, that is a fact
Might not believe you’re overconfident muthafricka…
But it’s like that
Let me tell you my theory, my hypothesis
Critical thinking is where the knowledge is
Ya making an experiment? It needs some op defs
If I can’t replicate it then you can hold ya breath
Now let’s talk about the research sensation
Case study, survey, naturalistic observation
Random samples let you generalize to a population
Without an experiment, make a correlation
Coefficient. Make a scatterplot
Make no illusory stuff or you’re distraught

Alright let’s go and discuss experiments…

Randomly assign those mothas to the groups
Experimental, control, muthafrickin fruit loops
Don’t forget to use a double-blind procedure
Or you may might get results that are weird-ah
Independent, confounding, dependent vary-ables
When I takin my placebo I get on the turntables
Mean, median, range, standard deviation
When I rap, I like to use gesticulation
And the normal curve. I can’t believe you have the nerve. Since…
You said I don’t have significance
Of the statistical variety
When you said that, it gave me anxiety
Culture is important in psychology
Informed consent and debriefing
Alright let’s get to unit 3 boiz!

Unit 3A
Yo mix masta Peez that was sum tight stuff muthafricka...

Biology - it’s one of a kind
It determines the way things work in your mind
You better remember everything psychological
Is simultaneously physical, invisible, biological
We started with phrenology from Franz Gall
He said “look at all these bumps” man he wasn’t on the ball
But he laid out a path for knowledge for biologists
And thus we did get biological psychologists

Neurons are the smallest guys of the bunch
Sensory neurons let you taste your lunch and
Motor neurons make you move your arms
Interneurons call the shots, man such a charm
Each one of these guys has three little bites:
The axon, cell body, and the dendrite
Now if they go too slow don’t get scared and leave
You can just speed it up with some myelin sheath

This may be a lot to remember all at once
But now we’re going on the beat tryna make you jump
Action potential is a little tiny charge
That sends some messages down, yeah they try to barge
When a neuron fires, those guys go down
And I swear they’re even faster than the speed of sound
Now there’s two types of signals to remember here:
Excitatory, inhibitory, but you have no fear cuz
If you pass the threshold with these
More neurons’ gonna fire just like a breeze!
Synapses, gaps where you gotta pass
Better hope your neurotransmitters shake their ass
Cause they carry the signals in this tiny gap
Only a matter of time before reuptake takes them back
There’s tons of neat types of these skeevy guys
My favorite are endorphins they give you such a high
If you want to mimic them get agonists
But otherwise block them with antagonists

(Voice) DJ turn it up! We’re absolutely jamming in here!
(DJ) Man I’m gettin nervous!

Did somebody say nervous? Like my favorite system-uh?
CNS is main but the PNS peripheral
The PNS got a lotta nerve
That’s right those crazy knotty cables’ll make you swerve!
Now somatic gets your muscles groovin up in this jam
And autonomic gets some crazy stuff in your glands
Parasympathetic calms down, sympathetic excites
You need em both to function, they balance out right
Your CNS has a brain and a cord for your spine
That cord gives you reflexes to survive by design
Now this sub-unit’s almost over, that’s right we’re almost done
Now crank that endocrine system, let’s have some fun!

Hormones are slow but important too
They’re the reason for growth in me and you!
Stuff like this is done by the pituitary
We won’t go over puberty man that stuff’s scary
There’s one last thing to share with my band
And that’s stuff about the adrenal gland
Never mind. We’ve talked enough
Now let’s get groovy with some real brain stuff!

Unit 3B
Lesion, EEG, CT, PET
I talk about this stuff because I am an emcee
Let’s not forget about the MRI
And the fMRI, wasssup!
You use your brainstem when you are a reptile
Use your medulla cause you’re def beat phile
Reticular formation, thalamus
Cerebellum, limbic system, and amygdalas
Your hypothalamus gives you a reward
So when you play Candy Crush ya don’t feel bored
Your cerebral cortex makes you think
Like these def rhymes that are on the brink
Of genius. Frontal, parietal, lobes
This video’s winning 8 Golden Globes
Temporal, occipital lobes
My sensory cortex registers the strobes
I’m athletic, I use my motor cortex
And association areas for the rest
I like my Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas
Without them, I would have aphasia
Plasticity is what it’s all about, man
We have permission from the Sandman
No this rap is not a scuttlebutt
Because my corpus callosum was cut
Consciousness is cool I must admit
And dual processing is some pretty crazy stuff

Unit 3C
Biology ain’t only boring stuff
Maybe genetics and evolutionary will be enough
Let’s talk now about behavior geneticists
They check the interplay of heredity and environment
Now what’s the order of genetic info?
It goes: DNA, genes, and chromosome
Wait that’s not the order of size man no
Maybe something’s wacky in my old genome
Let’s study those guys called fraternal twins
But when it comes to similarity, identical wins
We can learn about heritability
That measures the differences between you and me
Genes and environment do interact
Molecular genetics sees how DNA is stacked

Don’t see this as some kinda diss
But I don’t like evolutionary psychologists
Just kidding I swear they earn my affection
They apply Darwin’s principle of natural selection
Now it looks like this unit is basically done
WAIT THINGS ARE CHANGING: It’s a mutation
Just kidding: this unit’s over
Yea it’s your lucky day, frickING FOUR LEAF CLOVERS

WHAT!

Unit 4
Give me all of your selective attention
And Í will take you to another dimension
Top-down processing from the bottom-up
Inattentional blindness, you better shut up
I am also a victim of change blindness, too
Don’t understand psychophysics then you are a fool
What? I didn’t hear you. Iḿ the marquis
Absolute threshold? No sucker MCs!
Signal detection theory is pretty fun
Subliminal messages are priming everyone
The difference threshold is the best one to me
But I might be biased cuz I am a MC
Can’t listen to your stuff, It’s called Weber’s Law
Sensory adaptation so cold that I’ll never thaw

Transduction turns stimuli into impulses
That was on the ´16 Exam boiz
Come get me College Board, If you dare
But you can’t catch me cuz I’m faster than a hare
Wavelength, hue, intensity
Pupil, iris, lense, it’s easy
The lens’ accommodation helps you see
And the retina for an organ is pretty freakin G
Its got cones, rods, and the optic nerve
It’s got a blind spot, fovea so you can get served
I got feature detectors in my brain
Young-Helmholtz trichromatic theory makes me go insane
Opponent-process theory is pretty bad too
But it’s the sense of audition that make me really blue
Frequency, pitch, middle ear, cochlea
Inner ear, place/frequency theory Hey ya!
I have hearing loss, conduction or sensorineural
I guess I need a cochlear implant…
I said guess I need a cochlear implant…
But don’t take me to a doctor or a scientist
Those suckers are lying making me pissed
Kinesthesis is my favorite sense
All other senses are complete nonsense
I like vestibular and gate-control theory
When people see kinesthetic genius they fear me
How can I taste when I cannot smell?
That’s like a telephone without my boi Graham Bell
Sensory interaction is more important than you think
Without it, you be on the brink
Of the McGurk effect
Can’t understand me? Get rekt!
I can taste feelings and I can hear smells
Synesthesia mixes senses wherever I dwell
Now I’m not saying that it’s your fault
But most things are viewed as a gestalt
You got the figure-ground, grouping, proximity
Similarness, connectedness, and continuity
And closure, and depth perception
A dream in a dream? Whoa! That’s dreamception
Infants perceive depth with the visual cliff
They got binocular cues to get a lift
They got retinal disparity and monocular cues, too
Everybody knows I don’t like Highlander II
Here me talk about horizontal-vertical illusion
Relative height and interposition
Relative size and linear perspective
We’re gettin paid so we have an extrinsic incentive
Texture gradient, clarity, motion, light and shadow
I like to play sonic but don’t call me shallow
Stroboscopic movement helps you watch this video
And the phi phenomenon is pretty cool, yo
Perceptual constancy never changes
Shape constancy, size constancy are pretty deranged
Moon illusion/ponzo illusion, see?
Ames illusion, Relative luminance, wookie
Lightness constancy and color constancy
This rap is serious, it is not a comedy
Most psych emcees think that I only list terms
But I would like to mention that they should eat worms
I can’t see with my head upside down, oh yes I can
Perceptual adaptation helps me out, man
My schemas give me the perceptual set
You might be surprised this unit’s not done yet
Extrasensory perception is a load of bananas
Psychokinesis? Can’t say I’m a fan of
Parapsychology is the last term
Before I can end this unit with a burn
Look out emcees cuz imma get crazy
You can’t touch me because your rapping is lazy

Unit 5
Now it’s time for my rap game to take a turn
Talkin bout psychoactive drugs, with a couple burns
Now let’s define my friend consciousness
It’s ourselves and environment, our awareness
Sleep blanks that out in a special way they go
Circadian rhythms mind that ebb and flow
REM sleep is where your dreams come true
When you slip into that sleep you don’t know what to do
Alpha waves, delta waves, hallucinations man
When you’re not dreaming it’s called NREM
But why do we sleep? That’s not my concern
Using just the bold words have our A+ earned
But I should go over some sleepy diseases
Like insomnia, narcolepsy, apnea that’s sleepy
Night terrors  are especially spooky
But dreams, man, those are really kooky
Maybe some of your content is manifest
But analyze that latent stuff, man that’s the best
Even if you can’t have any sleep found
You’ll bounce right back with some REM rebound

Let’s go briefly over hypnosis
Even if you’re in this state you shouldn’t miss
My groovy rhymes, cause hypnosis is a sham
Or is it really? I got no clue man!
There’s somethin behind posthypnotic suggestions
But dissociation is still in question
So I guess it’s real? Or is it not?
Maybe in the end it’s all for naught

Psychoactive drugs may make you wince
But they make you even more if you got tolerance
Now you might actually want to bawl
If you go through a traumatizing withdrawal
There’s dependences: like physical
And of course its counterpart, psychological
Addiction is often misconceived
But now I’ll go over types of drugs you won’t believe
Depressants bum you out, barbiturates tranquilize
Stimulants excite and opiates lethargize
You’d get really messed up on amphetamines
This includes methamphetamine
There’s ecstasy and MDMA
I really hope that stuff stays away
Time to go over hallucinogens
Your perception of reality they really bend
There’s LSD which ain’t too dank
But there’s THC which is wicked bank
Your experience may be near death
But you don’t want to take your final breath

That’s it, another unit down
It’s not even halfway over! No need to frown

Unit 6
Alright let’s do it boys! Unit 6 is here
We gunna adapt with learning so have no fear
Association is how we learn
I’m habituated to your music, that is a burn
Conditioning: classical and operant
You better behave and abstain during lent
Observational learning at no expense
Violent movies are correlated with violence

Now our boi Pavlov was a pretty cool dude
He found the US, the UR, the NS, too
He found the CS, and CR as well
Just thinking bout him makes me salivate like hell
Acquisition is making the association
We started this project early: no procrastination
I once met a fly girl, and I adored her
She made my conditioning higher-order (Whooooooaoaaaaa!)
Extinction is... wait I forget
Is it time for spontaneous recovery yet?
Things seem similar: that’s generalization
Things look different: that’s discrimination
But Pavlov wasn’t always right
Some of his reasoning was not so tight
Animals can learn predictability
You should have learned helplessness, you’re a sucker emcee

Respondent behavior is the operant side
Writing bout this stuff makes me want to do a jive
Operant behavior works on the world
The law of effect makes learning unfurl
I opened Skinner’s Box, you know what was inside
The coolest mouse I ever seen in my life
Shaping is how I trained my dog without a fuss
No successive approximations cuz he’s a genius
Discriminative stimuli is reinforced
Don’t press the pause button, let us run our course
All the time I’m continuously reinforced
I get so many bills, it’s partially a force
Punishment or reinforcement, positive or negative
You only got one life and it’s the life you gotta live
Punisher or Reinforcer, how do I chose
Life is only a game and it’s a game we’re meant to lose
How many ways can I reinforce you
Fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, interval, too
I have a cognitive map in the place where I think
I could sell it to you for 50 rupees, Link
Latent learning and motivation
Extrinsic, Intrinsic, cuz I’m a sensation
Insight is important, too
It helped me write these lyrics and not be a fool

I model the monkey over there
A barrel of ‘em so beware
Monkey see monkey do, is what I say
And my mirror neurons help me along the way
Behavior modeling is important, too
Prosocial is nice, but anti gives me the blues
Why do people need to view violence?
I’m disturbed by their insistence
Don’t get desensitized by your trendy young adult books
Because Mix masta Peez never imitates the hooks

Unit 7A
You might think this is hard to remember
But think about memory, back since your first September!
It’s learning that has persisted over time
You remember all my mothafrickin groovy rhymes
There’s encoding, storage, retrieval too
You’re gon’ remember so much till you don’t know what to do
But sensory stuff is really really quick
It goes to short term to really make it stick
Then long term holds it for as long as you can
Working memory’s a new way for the topic to understand
Now how about encoding? Do we process automatic?
Well sure and it’s parallel don’t get too dramatic
You know it’ll stick when processing’s effortful
But only with a good bit of clean old rehearsal
And the spacing effect: man that stuff is tight
Serial position gets your first and last that’s right
There’s encoding visual, acoustic, semantic too
I’ve used this rhyme so many times you don’t know what to do
Now visual needs some sick imagery
And a mnemonic really helps your memory
Use some chunking to get your stuff in clumps
Man I gotta take a break to take a dump

Now short term storage has two memories:
Iconic and echoic are self-explanatory
Back to biological to which we’ve had initiation
A neuron is supported with long term potentiation
Your memories won’t leave if they’re bulbin’ flash
Amnesia sends your memories straight to ash
Implicit memory is silently retrieved
Explicit you don’t get with quite as much ease
This all goes down in the hippocampus
Santa’s evil sidekick is known as Krampus

Now how do you get that information out?
Recall, recognize, relearn, don’t pout!
Now you may be primed to know some stuff
Now you may be primed to know some stuff
Wait was that twice- a - dooby doo
Or was it just a little bit of deja vu
Now what we remember may be a little bent
Cause most of what we get is mood congruent
Proactive interference is when old blocks new
Retroactive is the other way, don’t forget foo’!
Now maybe we get anxiety or depressed
From memories that we try to repress
Remembering stuff wrong isn’t hard to perfect
When you got your misinformation effect
Or maybe some amnesia from the source
Now I think this verse has run its course!


Unit 7B
Next verse, here we go, start the ignition
Time to talk about frickin’ cognition
To start things off, here’s a problem-solving trick:
Algorithms are perfect, but heuristics are quick
And when we group similar objects
It’s called a concept
So just think outside the box, or your lines are bereft!
Now when you think of rap do you think of hype?
That’s prob’ly because it’s a prototype!
I heard you’re havin’ issues rhymin’ Q with E
So just think, use creativity!

Now let’s grow older, turn the page
Babbling, One-word, Two-word stage
Now telegraphic speech will get you talkin’
Next thing you know, you’re in a coffin
Yeah we’re talkin’ ‘bout language so stop your antics
The rules for language are called semantics
The smallest sound unit is phoneme
While the smallest meaning is a morpheme
If you ain’t speak right, you’re put in the slammer
So please work on your goddamn grammar
This rap’s just starting, don’t get relaxed
If you need to talk, you use syntax
Now I know language has your mind in a schism
But remember Whorf made linguistic determinism!

Now it’s time for these raps to take flight
Look into your soul for a little insight
Confirmation bias is a fickle little snitch
Just about as frustrating as the availability heuristic
Overconfidence can land you in a situation
So don’t get hung up on your fixation
Intuition helps you make decisions real quick
While framing can get you caught up in a trick
If you can’t think outside the box, don’t get upset
You’re prob’ly stuck in a mental set
Donkey Kong uses his fists to fight
While representativeness heuristic uses relies on prototypes
Functional fixedness will get you stuck
You just gotta learn to not give a frick
Last but not least is belief perseverance
That’s when your mind keeps a strict adherence
Now this verse is done, but don’t be irate
It’s time to move on to Unit 8!

Unit 8A
Now i know we were just talking about communication
But now let's transition to mad motivation
As it energizes and directs our behaviors
Instincts are unlearned and have common patterns
I know what you're thinking, how is this connected?
Please be patient, while the drive reduction theory’s dissected
It involves aroused states filled with tension
You can't relax until you fill that need, not to mention
We need to fulfill homeostasis
Unless you want to end up like dead old man Jenkins
I advise you to listen to your incentive
Thats right, wake the frick up and be attentive!
If you are not attentive to your needs
Maslow will make you choke on some beads
Youre damn right, its not invalid
Maslow created a damn pyramid
Its called the hierarchy of needs
We need to fulfill our psychological seeds
Then comes safety, and belongingness
Esteem, self-actualization, and self transcendence
Of course you can't fill needs when you’re tired
So get some glucose, or you'll never be hired
Thats right you need to get a job
According to Maslow you shouldn't be a slob
Now even i'm wondering what else is there to tell
Let me enlighten you, and make you crawl out of your shell
You see we have something called a set point
It has to with hunger, and your metabolic rate
Our bodies are really exciting things
They are temples meant for kings
If you want to treat this king right
Basal metabolic rate should be there day and night
It's something that makes your energy feel alright
Anorexia and bulimia, and binge eating
Disorders that can make your body take a beating
Masters and Johnson studied sex
Their job probably got them some hefty checks
They examined and pondered about the sexual response cycle
And came to a conclusion, the cycle is like a well oiled motorcycle
We got excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution
This only works with the help of menstruation
Now if you're like us emcees
And have sex until you hit a period of refractory
Then you might want to cool it and try again later
As you won't be a very good mate-r
We got estrogen for the women
Testosterone for the men
Of course each sex has quite the blend
But those have nothing to do with sexual orientation
Everyone has a specific attraction

Unit 8B
A song with every term it? That’s bold...face
Imma go in to tha mix so we can keep the pace
The subject is emotion, it’s what we’re gunna discuss
To James-Lange emotion is physical awarenuss
Cannon-Bard says body rhymes
And emotions occur at the same time
The two-factor theory has two parts
You gotta be aroused and label it to so you can fall apart
You got a polygraph? Well poly wanna graph!
I got a barrel of monkeys and I gotta giraffe
I smile, that makes me more happy
You are gonna frown and feel sad when I’m rapping
That’s called facial feedback. It’s an attack
On our small-town American values from back
In the day
Got catharsis? Say hey!
What a wonderful kind of muthafricken day
I’m angry, so I SCREAM!
But catharsis isn’t real so I get more mean
Yes I may listen to your mixtape
But feel good-do good with never fix the gaping
Hole you left in my heart, when you went away
My well-being is all gone, I’m sad to say
(MC Frannypants? He’s faster than a bike!)
Well you obviously never heard masta Peez on the mic
Adaptation-level will bring you up to speed
To experience def rhymes that will make you bleed
I’m not as well off as that other man
As walk down the street, a Doctor Pepper in my hand
That’s relative deprivation, compare to another
You best believe that this term is a mutha
Behavioral medicine, health psych, and stress
Two aren’t on the AP, so we’ll talk about them less
Feeling stressed out? Take an adderall
Just kidding, The GAS (General Adaptation Syndrome) has got your call
First you got alarm your heart starts beating
Then you got resistance, but your energy’s fleeting
Last you got exhaustion, and that’s the end of the road
Can even believe how these rhymes have flowed?
Coronary heart disease is no joke
Vessels get clogged, this isn’t a hoax
Type A people are aggressive, unbridled
Type B people are considerably more mild
I saw my boi type A as hard-driving as a bull
And I was with my boi type B at type A’s funeral
Psychophysiological illness
MC Frannypants never has stillness
Psych-psych-neuro-neuro-immunology
I said a one-word line and the name is masta Peez
Lymphocytes help you when you are feeling sick
They attack bad things, and they do that pretty quick

Unit 9
Now let’s discuss developmental psych
It will help Alexander learn how to ride a bike
Zygote, embryo and the fetus spells ZEF
And you best believe these rhymes are def
For a fetus, teratogens are bad news
Fetal alcohol syndrome gives babies the blues
When we’re young, maturation is faster
When I’m on the microphone, it’s a disaster
For you. Ya better make another schema
Maybe assimilate a ruse, because I am a sly lemur
I’ll accommodate you, if you don’t understand
I like to wear ASSPIZZA because it is a cool brand
Now let’s discuss a guy named Piaget
He made some discoveries that are pretty insane
He made the stages of cognitive development
When I make a treb it is really efficient
We start off with sensorimotor
No object permanence, another day another dolor
That brings us to the preoperational
This rap is getting pretty senational
These little guys have no conservation
Whoa! That pond has lots of eutrophication
Egocentrism, theory of mind
If you can’t see, then you are blind
Now let’s discuss the concrete op
You on on n’ on and you don’t dare stop
Formal operational is the end of the road
Autism is appears in childhood
Now I don’t want you to get mad at me
But you give me stranger anxiety
Attachment is an emotional tie
It can be secure or not, and that’s not a lie
You develop a lot in the critical period
Everyone knows my rhyming skills are myriad
Imprinting makes you attach yourself
My favorite Will Ferrell film? Muthafrickin ELF!
My temperament is volatile
Don’t have basic trust, I only have style
My self-concept is that I’m the best
I can’t even talk about the rest
Without laughing.... Ha ha ha
Look out for Frannypants, cuz it’s the law
Gender is influenced by society
I’m a kung foo master, just call me Bruce Lee
I feel aggressive, I have a genome
I guess it’s because I have X and Y chromosomes
And testosterone. Being the greatest is my role
Gender roles, I like to eat egg rolls
Gender Identity is a sense
This muthafrickin unit’s getting pretty intense
Gender typing is the acquisition of a role
You want me to produce? You’ll have to cajole
Social learning theory, it makes me weary
If you’re a snitch, then you’d better fear me
The best time of life is adolescence
Unless you are taking strong depressants
In which case you’re a straight phony
Holden Caulfield would call you a piece of baloney
And let’s not forget about Great Expectations
Sometimes puberty is worse than castration
And what was up with that bourgeois society?
Sex characteristics of the primary variety
And secondary to make everything all work
Ain’t nothing funny so wipe that smirk
Off your face. You’re worse than vegetables
Everyone knows swearing is unethical
Organs that make reproduction possible
And voice cracks that make life more awful
Than it already is. And that’s pretty bad
You best believe menarche is NOT a bunch of malarkey
What is my morality? I’m speaking reality rap
And I’m not a sap
Pre, nothing, and post conventional stages
This rap is about to hit eighteen pages
Erikson had insights into identity
Who am I? And social: who are we?
His psychosocial stages do not apply to me
There’s only one stage for a def emcee
And that’s killin it vs. killin it, that’s the game
These rhymes are hypnotizing and making you insane
Intimacy? Huh? What’s that?
Is it spraying stupid suckas with a giant-ass gat?
Emerging adulthood is on the AP
You can trust me cause I am an emcee
Menopause is the natural cessation
Of that process that we call menstruation
Wanna measure something over life? It’s easy!
Just conduct a freakin longitudinal study
If you want results quick, and baby we do
Then the cross-sectional study is just for you
I’ve got knowledge, and that’s a fact
My crystallized intelligence is way off the track
You got flow? Hell no, you don’t
Your fluid intelligence lacks, it’s drowned in the moat
By my social clock, you’re way overdue
But you can’t make a comeback cause you’re a fool

Interlude
Sitting alone in the comfort of my home
Just one thing on my mind
I want to run with all my pals in the old cross-country grind
I wish I were running with my charming eye for charisma the size of a bear
But I can't feel my legs from all this pain, so much stress I am losing my hair

Clap, clap your hands
Clap, clap your hands
Clap, clap your hands
Move your body to the rhythm of my band

It's so dark I'm alone I got abducted from my home, I wish I knew where I was
I grabbed by a man with powerful hands that were covered in a slimy scuzz
I think I'm dying I can't tell if I'm crying, running would have done some good
I could have run to all my pals, now I'm tied up in the hood

Clap, clap your hands
Clap, clap your hands
Clap, clap your hands
Move your body to the rhythm of my band

Clap, clap your hands
Clap, clap your hands
Clap, clap your hands
Move your body to the rhythm of my band

Unit 10
Personality is a pattern of your character
Ya thinker, ya feeler, ya crazy actor
Now Freud has a wack way of looking at this
We call his ideas psychodynamics
Exploring the unconscious with free association
Psychoanalysis was sweeping the nation
Ego is the moral, id is the crazy
Superego balances so neither one is lazy
Psychosexual stages give a real nice rhyme
Oral Anal Phallic Latency Genital time!
Oedipus complex? Seems simple to me
Guy’s lovin his mom, that’s weird you FREAK
You get your parents’ values with identification
Get stuck on those stages with some mad fixation
There’s defense mechanisms like reaction formation
Repression you block, go back with regression
Projection you move it, or justify and rationalize
Displacement you change your target: are these all lies?
Sublimation’s displacement, but fancier man
Denial’s when rejecting is your plan
Now Freud was a mess let’s look at Jung
His collective unconscious was pretty far-flung
How’d these people check this stuff? With some projective tests
In my opinion that TAT is the best
Or how about Rorschach? His blots were fly
Secretly through this rap I only want to die
Terror management deals with that stuff
Alright Freud, I think we’ve had enough

Humanistic perspective got some different views
Self actualization is what we want, yeah me and you
Rogers was a crazy little human-loving bard
He gave us all unconditional positive regard
Self-concept is crucial here
Now let’s go over traits now have no fear

Look it over with an inventory of personality
Like the mothafrickin MMP inventory
All these tests are empirically derived
Like the AP test we gonna GET THAT 5!
That’s all for traits seemed pretty lame
Now a few more bits here: are you game?

My favorite perspective is social cognitive
Says interaction determines the way we live
Reciprocal determinism is a founding principle
Say that parking lot just might be municipal
Tell me where’s your personal control?
Is your locus internal or sadly external?
Let’s explore your self it seems really cool
With the spotlight effect, all eyes on you
Self esteem ain’t always bad
If you have just the right amount you’ll be pretty glad
Self serving bias is a nasty flaw
You say you’re always better straight from your jaw
How’s your culture, got collectivism?
Or more self-centered: individualism?
That’s it for personality
Four more verses, but first I gotta pee

Unit 11
If you're unaware of the smarts in your brain nest
Then you might want to consider an intelligence test
Watchout here comes a charging knight with a lance
Don't be a fool, dodge it, use your intelli-gance (intelligence)
Next we have some factor analysis
Thats clusters, and relates to general intelligence
Theres something called savant syndrome
Thats being exceptional at a specific skill in your dome
Spearman, Thurstone, Gardner, and sternberg
These are my bois, we chillen in Luxembourg
Theres something in us, its hard to explain
Their called emotions, and they start in our brain
It s important to understand them
Thats emotional intelligence, just ask mom
Speaking of mom you could give her a test
Its for mental age, she better do her best
Thats intelligence based on age
It can make people fill with rage (background: if they stupid)
Binets test was soon revised
To the stanford-binet test, now even more demise (background: if they stupid)
Mental age and actual age are very relevant
Its called IQ and it fills your empty skeleton
Now with evrything you know, try and do your best
As we measure what you know with an achievement test
To get the answers and averages thats  for all
We need a group thats pretested, not shopping at the mall
Thats standardization, they predict the future like a magic eight ball
Hopefully we can trust them all
Thats reliability, before you test, please no alcohol
Validity is the the hopeful one of the call
As it predicts the suppos-ed outcome, ya’ll
We were put in the world with intellectual disabilities
Thats an IQ of 70 or below
Down syndrome falls into this category
But that doesn't mean you have less of a story
This verse is now done
But the song still has a ton

Unit 12
Unit 12 let’s go, it’s about time
Abnormal psych’s the topic that were gonna rhyme
Deviant, distressful, dysfunctional patterns
Psychological disorders are like caverns
Having ADHD is not easy
But it’s real easy to rhyme better than Yeezy
Psych disorders can be treated
The medical model has never been beated
You need a diagnosis, then don’t look to far
The DSM-V will make you faster than a jaguar
Never diagnose someone who you don’t know
Because, son you’re not a professionul
Take my advice, don’t treat people like mice
Cuz if I see you you’ll pay the muthafricken price
Anxiety disorders are distressing
Nothing I would like to eat with a bit of French dressing
The generalized kind isn’t too rad
Constant autonomic arousal is pretty bad
With panic disorder, you get panic attacks
You better know that this is not the funky radical bombtrack
This is MC Frannypants n’ hiz boiz
You best believe we don’t play with muthafricken toys
I don’t like spiders, when I see ‘em I scream
Anxiety from phobias can get pretty mean
Like my rhymes. This beat is hoppin’
It goes on on n’ on and it’s never stoppin
Obsessive compulsive disorder can be hell
It certainly was for my boi Howie Mandel
Post-traumatic stress disorder can be haunting
It can strike when the odds become daunting
Somatoform disorders are pretty weird
The mind is everything, like a sheep that’s sheared
Somatic symptoms with no physical cause
Conversion disorder is an examples
Hypochondriasis is another too
My doctor’s always thinking about deja vu
Can your consciousness become separated?
Well multiple personality is a term that’s dated
DID could be real, I admit
Or it could be a big pile of bullstuff
Mood disorders like depressive and mania
Come with me my friends, we’ll go to Transylvania
Bipolar Disorder does not have a boarder
I want a boat, I’m rich, I can afford her
Schizophrenia is a complex condition
It’s characterized by delusional thinking
Maybe due to too many dopamine receptors
Hallucinations that you’ve seen spectre
Personality disorders impair social function
You do something inappropriate at a luncheon
Antisocial personality sufferers have lack of conscience
They can be sly and clever or obnoxious
Well that bring us to the end of unit 12
Unit 13 is the next unit in which we’ll delve

Unit 13
Now we’re gonna talk about treatments
Listen closely and I’ll tell you some secrets
The eclectic approach is pretty wack
Various forms of therapy to help you kick back
Sigmund Freud was a fan of psychotherapy
Sit down and listen as I rap about it merrily
He helped patients using that psychoanalysis
Don’t even think about touching that cannabis
Resistance is blocking spooky material
Apple jacks are the superior cereal (UH)
Freud really liked using interpretation
This project really furthers my edjumacation
I’m hoping this rap still has coherence
And it’s not just a sign of a developing transference
Influenced by Freud, psychotherapists are
Opening my mind with a crowbar
Psychodynamic, Insight, client-centered, behavior therapy
All designed to fix your mind’s irregularity
While Pavlov used that classical conditioning
Rogers later developed active listening
While also promoting unconditional positive regard
Hopefully this rhyme isn’t too avant-garde
Unwanted behaviors might be fixed by counterconditioning
All these boldface terms are becoming sickening
Let’s please hurry up with this thing
Exposure therapy seems pretty odd
Desensitization makes you go abroad
Virtual reality can help you face your fears
Put on your Oculus Rift and your headgear
Use aversive conditioning if you’re drinking too much
So if you drink a little, you don’t feel too clutch
Token economies are based on operant ideas
Cognitive therapy is like a delicious tortilla
Cognitive-behavioral therapy
Can help you be happier if you want to be
Family therapy is available too
It’s more exciting than the battle of Waterloo
Regression toward the mean, meta-analysis
These rhymes are so strong they’re gunna give you paralysis
Evidence-based practice, that is cool
Clinical psychologists call it their favorite tool
Meds might be prescribed for your nervous system
It's biomedical therapy, don't resist ‘em!
Walking down through dollar tree
I saw an ad for psychopharmacology
I don't know about you, but free drugs sounds good to me
Antipsychotic drugs are mostly used to treat schizophrenia
But their side effects include tardive dyskinesia
There's also drugs to treat your anxiety and depression (antianxiety and antidepressant)
Hot damn, this beat is so pleasant
ECT involves electrical current in your brain
It’s designed to help put an end to the pain
This is as good as this rhymes gonna ever be
RTMS stimulates the brain with magnetic energy
Psychosurgery and lobotomy are options if you’re brave
Resilience helps you recover from experiences close to the grave
This verse is ending, I’m practically done
After 13 units, psych is still fun

Unit 14
Alright boys and girls, let’s get rowdy
Cuz we’re about to talk about Social Psychology!
Often times, when a situation gets hairy
The behavior is explained with attribution theory
The situation matters more than you may care for
So don’t forget, it’s fundamental attribution error!
If all your friends tell you you’re rude
It’s probably due to your attitude
Central route persuasion gets right to the point
But peripheral route persuasion might hand you an iced cream
Make some requests from smaller to bigger
Foot-in-the-door phenomenon is a mutha quicker
If you’re going out with your friends to bowl
Make sure you know your social role
I went and stole a balloon at the store
But stealing is something that I abhor
But I did it due to my friends’ insistence
Now I’m strapped down by cognitive dissonance
Will I change my actions? Well, I may
But I’ll likely be jacking stuff till the end of the day
Because my attitude changed. It’s different
People need to listen to my rap cause they’re ignorant
Solomon Asch is a mutha you must know
He’s got lines and some actors, like on a game show
My rap is gunna warn you, cause I’m an emcee
About that mad muthafricka called conformity
You want my approval? That’s normative
Don’t ridicule me but Vanilla Ice is formative
You believe me? Well, that’s informational
I’m not quiet, I’m confrontational
I know how to rhyme, this isn’t cockiness
Social facilitation helps when I have an audience
My competitors suck cuz they’re so lame
Their suckin rhymes they drive me insane
When you’re doin’ group work please don’t go oafing
Becasue that’s also known as social loafing
Feelin’ frisky in a crowd, tryna do some masturbation?
I’ll betcha it’s because of deindividuation!
Now ask around that group, find what you wanna do
Thanks to group polarization, the others will too!
And when your desire for harmony makes a big stink
Don’t worry, just blame it on the damn groupthink
Whenever you see Americans actin’ like vultures
Just remember it’s part of their culture
Some people hate gay marriage and are startin’ up a storm
But that’s just because it’s not a norm
If you get close and try and undo my lace
Take a step back, I need some personal space!
If your feelings toward Latinos aren’t very lecherous
You might realize you have a racial prejudice
If you see a black man and think he has a knife
Chill the frick out, that’s a stereotype
If you own a restaurant and won’t seat a Haitian
You’re an awful person, and that’s discrimination
When you have a lot of friend’s, you’re in the ingroup
But in the outgroup you’re out of the loop
Ingroup bias has you favoring your friends
While scapegoat theory puts a rando on the ends
If you see a white man and say “Hey that’s Brian Wecht!”
You’re probably white too, and that’s the other-race effect
And if you believe that white man deserves to get it on
You’re just a product of the just-world phenomenon
Now quiet on down, there’s no need for a lesson
We all know about good ol’ aggression
If you get frustrated that you aren’t invincible
You’ll probably get aggressive by the frustration-aggression principle
If you hate someone and you’re stuck in a sect
You’ll learn to like them with the mere exposure effect
When I’m with Xander I’m in the clouds above
Because we experience much passionate love
You recognize the effects of
Your friends live on yours through companionate love
Make sure these relationships have no obsequity
Make sure they’re filled with lots of equity
As celebrities we can get lots of exposure
If we give the paparazzi lots of self-disclosure
And if we follow the religion of Buddhism
We may just experience some sick altruism
When someone’s in danger and you just stand erect
You’re experiencing the bystander effect
And if you’re tryna make deals with Beverly Cleary
Just remeber interactions are defined by social exchange theory
If you helped a friend out then don’t expect scorn
They’re expected to help back with the reciprocity norm
I know there’s many norms so I’m tryna keep em warm
Bein responsible for a kid is social-responsibility norm
When you can’t solve a problem, all the solutions make you sick
You’re probably experiencing a frickin’ conflict
If you’re lookin’ at 2 mutually destructive cats
They’ve definitely found themselves in a social trap
If you think your side is good, and find the other side correctin’
You both suffer from mirror-image perceptions
But if you think you won´t like your tea
You might suffer from a self-fulfilling prophecy
If people feel differently within their roles
You can overcome that with superordinate goals
Now it’s the end of the verse so it’s sure to be lit
You can decrease international tension but just using GRIT

Appendices
We’re done with the units but we’re not done yet
We got the appendices, and those we can’t forget
Now imma talk about flow, that’s what I’m gonna do
That’s when you have a focus state and engagement, too
Personnel psychology is also on the AP
Just kidding, it’s not, I’m a tricky emcee
Industrial organizational wasn’t on the test
That’s right I’m discussing specific questions man I’m the best
Regular organizational wasn’t on there either
Human factors is also good Imma take a breather
Structured interviews can help us see
Solid information about you and me
Achievement motivation is accomplishment desire
Yeah that’s right my rhymes are fire
Task leadership is goal oriented
Social leadership is towards the people bended
Two more appendices are still left
And we’ll take you all along in a way that’s real deft
I don’t really know how to cope
With the stress this song is giving me, not too dope
I’ll try problem-focused and affect it head on
Or emotion-focused to ease the stress from the rinclons
Aerobic exercise is great for you
Join cross country you silly foo’!
Biofeedback is the second to last term
What does CAM stand for? Don’t know I’m a worm
Or worse: I’m worse than the dirt
From this entire fricking rap my mouth will start to hurt
That was meyers, muthafricka

Outro:
Man I’m happy! It’s finally done
Now a 5 on your test you have really won
Now let’s think what’d we learn today
To think about life in a whole new way?
Different perspectives, biology too
You can now interpret behavior in a zoo
Like gorillas those guys are really wack
But if you don’t see him while counting passes you’re still on track
Cause now you know the way this really all works
In the corners of your brain this always lurks
Because you learned it all! You learned it complete
Maybe we’ll make review books obsolete1Embed
