47 ContributorsLearn to Fly Lyrics[Verse 1]
Run and tell all of the angels, this could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution, 'cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughin' and watched the last one die

[Chorus]
Now I'm lookin' to the sky to save me, lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of lyin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high

[Verse 2]
I think I'm done nursin' the patience, it can wait one night
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Run and tell the angels that everything's all right

[Chorus]
Now I'm lookin' to the sky to save me, I'm lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to

[Bridge]
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own

I'm lookin' to the sky to save me, I'm lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'
Make my way back home when I learn to
Lookin' to the sky to save me, I'm lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to fly
Make my way back home when I learn to...20Embed
