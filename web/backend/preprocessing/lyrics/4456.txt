I made another mistake, thought I could change
Thought I could make it out
Promises break, need to hear you say
"You're gonna keep it now"

[Pre-Chorus]
I miss the way you say my name
The way you bend, the way you break
Your makeup running down your face
The way you touch, the way you taste

[Chorus]
When the curtains call the time
Will we both go home alive?
It wasn't hard to realize
Love's the death of peace of mind

[Verse 2]
You're in the walls that I made, with crosses and frames
Hanging upside down
For granted, in vain, I took everything
I ever cared about

[Pre-Chorus]
I miss the way you say my name
The way you bend, the way you break
Your makeup running down your face
The way you fuck, the way you taste

When the curtains call the time
Will we both go home alive?
It wasn't hard to realize
Love's the death of peace of mind
When the curtains call the time
Will we both be satisfied?
It wasn't hard to realize
Love's the death of peace of mind

[Post-Chorus]
Love's the death of peace of mind

[Bridge]
You come and go in waves
Leavin' me in your wake
You come and go in waves
Swallowing everything

[Breakdown]
Oh
Are you satisfied?
Love's the death of peace of mind
Mine, mine

[Chorus]
When the curtains call the time
Will we both go home alive?
It wasn't hard to realize
Love's the death of peace of mind
When the curtains call the time
Will we both be satisfied?
It wasn't hard to realize
Love's the death of peace of mind
Love's the death of peace of mind
[Outro]
Love's the death of peace of mind7Embed
