3 ContributorsPJ Masks Theme Song Lyrics[Intro: PJ Masks]
Catboy, Owlette, Gecko, Let's go

[Bridge]
Goes into the night so they can save the day
Who are these heros to show you the way?

[Verse: PJ Masks]
PJ Masks we're the PJ Masks
PJ Masks we're the PJ Masks
'Cause bed time is the right time to fight crime
I can't think of a rhyme
PJ Masks we're the PJ Masks
PJ Masks we're the the PJ Masks

[Outro: PJ Masks]
