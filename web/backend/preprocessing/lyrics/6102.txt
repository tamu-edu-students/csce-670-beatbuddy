I say hi, you say hi
We stay high, you look so pretty, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm sweat from head to toe
I'm wet through all my clothes
I'm fully charged, nipples are hard
Ready to go
I'm sweat from head to toe
I'm wet through all my clothes
I'm fully charged, nipples are hard
Ready to go

No, I don't, I don't have a type, take a hit
Come on over tonight, take a hit
You can follow my bloodstream, wild
No, I don't have a type

[Pre-Chorus]
Live right now, peakin' on top
So wild now, I'm high as fuck, don't look down
Mama, you can relax
I know how to dial it back, not this time
