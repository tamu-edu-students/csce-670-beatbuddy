39 ContributorsReal Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm American made, Bud Light, Chevrolet
My mama taught me wrong from right
I was born in the South
Sometimes I have a big mouth
When I see somethin' that I don't like
I gotta say it

[Verse 2]
Well, we've been driving this road for a mighty long time
Payin' no mind to the signs
Well, this neighborhood's changed
It's all been rearranged
We left that dream somewhere behind

[Chorus]
Slow down, you're gonna crash
Baby, you were screaming, it's a blast, blast, blast
Look out, babe, you've got your blinders on
Everybody's lookin' for a way to get real gone
Real gone
Real gone

[Verse 3]
But there's a new cat in town
He's got high paid friends
Thinks he's gonna change history
You think you know him so well
Yeah, you think he's so swell
But he's just perpetuatin' prophecy

(C'mon now) Slow down, you're gonna crash
Baby, you were screaming, it's a blast, blast, blast
Look out, you've got your blinders on
Everybody's looking for a way
To get real gone (Uh-uh-uh-uh)
Real gone (Uh-uh-uh-uh)
Real gone (Uh-uh-uh-uh)
Real gone (Uh-uh-uh-uh)
Uh

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Well, you can say what you want
But you can't say it 'round here
'Cause they'll catch you and give you a whippin'
Well, I believe I was right when I said you were wrong
You didn't like the sound of that
Now, did ya?

[Chorus]
Slow down, you're gonna crash
Baby, you were screaming, it's a blast, blast, blast
Look out, you've got your blinders on
Everybody's looking for a way to get real gone
Well, here I come and I'm so not scared
Got my pedal to the metal, got my hands in the air
Look out, you take your blinders off
Everybody's looking for a way to get real gone
Real gone
Real gone
Ooh
[Outro]
Real gone
Real goneEmbed
