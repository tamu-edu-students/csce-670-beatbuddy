Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
You might also like[Chorus]
But in another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, woah
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away (The one that got away)
[Post-Chorus]
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away49Embed
