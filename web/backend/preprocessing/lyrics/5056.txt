48 ContributorsDance Macabre Lyrics[Verse 1: Cardinal Copia]
You'll soon be hearing the chime
Close to midnight
If I could turn back the time
I'd make all right

[Pre-Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
How could it end like this?
There's a sting in the way you kiss me
Something within your eyes said it could be the last time
'Fore it's over!

[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night

[Verse 2: Cardinal Copia]
It keeps on giving me chills
But I know now
I feel the closer we get
To the last bow

[Pre-Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
I don't wanna end like this (Cataclysm)
But there's sting in the way you kiss me (Armageddon)
Something within your eyes said it could be the last time
'Fore it's over!

Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you, one last time in the ancient rite
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night

[Guitar Solo: Tom Delgety]

[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you all night
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night

[Outro: Cardinal Copia]
All night
