For now you can stay
Right here we will play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly different frame of mind
Right here in my arms
Away from all harm
You'll be safe from all the flares
Although I know you don't care

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
You can lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath and give it time
You can walk the path along the lines
With your shattered frame of mind
Or instead, you could always stay
We can wait right here and play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly better frame of mind
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
When they say you will fall
You can reach nothing at all
Hide your tracks beneath the rind
Of a different frame of mind
Is that what you heard?
Broken words in the dirt
Yelling out, into the sun
Here we come, here we come

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Here we come, here we come)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Here we come, here we come)
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
You can lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath and give it time
You can walk the path along the lines
With your shattered frame of mind
Or instead, you could always stay
We can wait right here and play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly better frame of mind
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
You can lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath and give it time
You can walk the path among the lines
With your shattered frame of mind
Or instead, you could always stay
We can wait right here and play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly better frame of mind

[Bridge]
(Oh-oh-oh) And when daylight comes through
When the day is anew
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Then it will be time
For a new frame of mind
(Oh-oh-oh) When all eyes are on you
You will know what to do
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Since you will have found
Your new frame of mind
[Outro]
When you lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath and give it time
You can walk the path among the lines
But always know that you'll be safe
I'll be here throughout your days
Come find me and we will play31Embed
