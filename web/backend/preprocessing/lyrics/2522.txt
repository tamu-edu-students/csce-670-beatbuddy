30 ContributorsSailing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

[Verse 2]
It's not far to never never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

[Chorus]
Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

[Verse 3]
Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

[Verse 4]
Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Really, believe me

[Chorus]
Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free6Embed Sailing Christopher Cross Christopher Cross disco
