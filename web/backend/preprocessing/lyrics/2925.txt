60 ContributorsI Really Like You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I really wanna stop, but I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey, hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

[Chorus]
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I’m so in my head when we’re out of touch
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

[Verse 2]
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah, we could stay alone
You and me, and this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby

Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love (Love)
But I need to tell you something

[Chorus]
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I’m so in my head when we’re out of touch (When we’re out of touch!)
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

[Bridge]
Who gave you eyes like that
And said you could keep them?
I don’t know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I’m running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something
Yeah!
[Chorus]
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you (Oh oh oh)
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much? (Did I say too much?)
I’m so in my head when we’re out of touch (I’m so in my head, when we’re out of touch)
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too? (Yeah!)
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too? (Yeah, I need to tell you something)
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you (Oh, yeah)
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?58Embed
