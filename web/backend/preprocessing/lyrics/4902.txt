"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

[Chorus]
Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

[Verse 2]
Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me "Lip Parade"
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent
You might also like[Chorus]
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles
[Verse 3]
Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I, and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now, to know it in my memory

[Pre-Chorus]
And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

[Chorus]
High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles62Embed
