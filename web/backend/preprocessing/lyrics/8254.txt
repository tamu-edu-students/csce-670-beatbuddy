32 ContributorsOh, Me Lyrics[Verse]
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feeling
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice sprinkled with emotion?
Invented at your birth

[Chorus]
I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse, I cannot see
Formulate infinity
Store it deep inside me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse]
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feeling
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice sprinkled with emotion?
Invented at your birth
You might also like[Chorus]
I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse, I cannot see
Formulate infinity
Store it deep inside me
(Formulate infinity, deep inside me)
