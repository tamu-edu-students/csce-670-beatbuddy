9 ContributorsBLOOD Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tryna lose track of these sirens
Tryna make my way back to the silence
(Tryna make my way back to the silence)
You got a one-track mind like a drive-in
I can hear the graveyard sing, now you got me flat linin'
Tryna make my way back to the silence
(Tryna make my way back to the silence)

[Pre-Chorus]
Suddenly, I been sittin' back wonderin'
Why you been comin' 'round cuttin' me
And now my blood bleeds quicker than my heart beats
Suddenly, I been sittin' back wonderin'
Why you been comin' 'round cuttin' me
And now my blood bleeds quicker than my heart beats

[Chorus]
Blood bleeds quicker than my heart beats
(Quickеr than my, quicker than my)
(Quicker than my, quicker than my, quickеr than my)
And now my blood bleeds quicker than my heart beats
(Quicker than my, quicker than my)
(Quicker than my, quicker than my, quicker than my)
And now my blood bleeds quicker than my heart beats
(Quicker than my, quicker than my)
(Quicker than my, quicker than my, quicker than my)
Blood bleeds quicker than my heart beats
And now my blood bleeds quicker than my heart beats

Ten feet deep, but I'm far from groundin'
Losin' my feet and I keep on drownin'
I'm on a one-way street, you got me surrounded
(I'm on a one-way street, you got me surrounded)
You got a one-track mind like a drive-in
I can hear the graveyard sing, now you got me flat-linin'
Tryna make my way back to the silence
(Tryna make my way back to the silence)

[Pre-Chorus]
Suddenly, I been sittin' back wonderin'

And now my blood bleeds quicker than my heart beats
