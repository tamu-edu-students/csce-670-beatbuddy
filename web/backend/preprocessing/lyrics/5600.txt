I'm putting your patience to the test
I'm putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice

[Verse 2]
Sellin' your body to the street
Sending your girlfriends to the night, for cheap
Wearing a jacket made of meat
Sealing a letter made with horse's feet
And now you've heard that

[Chorus 1]
Waves turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's the USA
Platinum's on the rise
Sleeping in the sky
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb

[Verse 1]
I'm putting your patience to the test
I'm putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice
And now you've seen that
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Blondes turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's the USA
Porn's on the rise
Psychos in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb

[Bridge]
Darling, ain't nobody gonna tell us
They're gonna be oh so jealous
We're gonna be oh so silent
They're gonna be stoned in silence
(I didn't want to ask you, baby)
(I didn't want to have to ask anybody, baby)
(Is anyone asking maybe?)
(Can anyone even hear me?)

[Interlude]
Why are you waiting beyond the door?

[Chorus 3]
Life turns to dust
And rain turns to rust
Gossip is a truth
And money pays for the lies we trust
Your love is a surprise
Homeless saints are in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A nice place for you and I18Embed
