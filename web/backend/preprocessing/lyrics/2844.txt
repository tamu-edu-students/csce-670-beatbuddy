Looking back at me, I see that I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in things I cannot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Somethin' strong, like a drug, that gets me high

[Chorus: Ed Sloan, Tony Byroads, Ed Sloan & Tony Byroads]
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so...

[Verse 2: Ed Sloan, Ed Sloan & Tony Byroads]
...Cold to you. I'm sorry 'bout all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You can see me stand on my own again
'Cause now I can see
You are the antidote that got me by
Somethin' strong, like a drug, that got me high

[Chorus: Ed Sloan, Tony Byroads, Ed Sloan & Tony Byroads]
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold

I never meant to be so cold

[Bridge: Tony Byroads, Ed Sloan & Tony Byroads]
I never really wanted you to see
The screwed-up side of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me there's just no hope
I never meant to be so cold

[Chorus: Ed Sloan, Tony Byroads]
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am (Is I'm sorry for the way I am)
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am (Is I'm sorry for the way I am)
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold11Embed
