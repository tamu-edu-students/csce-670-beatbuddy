8 ContributorsOlder Lyrics[Verse]
Back then we just didn't know how to hold a heart
Without breaking it apart
And I never felt so much that when we touched
It could've been love (yeah)
It should've been us

[Pre]
We fucked around just a little too long
Let the love get a little too strong
Promised eachother just a little too much
And we grow up just a little too young

[Chorus]
I wish that I met you when I was older
Woulda held you closer
Than it wouldn't be over over
I wish that I met you when I was older
I'd still be there for ya then it wouldn't be over overYou might also likeEmbed
