21 ContributorsJust Like You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I could be mean
I could be angry
You know I could be just like you
I could be fake
I could be stupid
You know I could be just like you

[Pre-Chorus]
You thought you were standing beside me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you (Just like you)

[Chorus]
You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you (Just like you)
You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you

[Verse 2]
I could be cold
I could be ruthless
You know I could be just like you
I could be weak
I could be senseless
You know I could be just like you

You thought you were standing beside me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you (Just like you)

[Chorus]
You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you (Just like you)
You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you

[Bridge]
On my own
'Cause I can't take living with you
I'm alone
So I won't turn out like you want me to

[Pre-Chorus]
You thought you were standing beside me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you (Just like you)

[Chorus]
You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you (Just like you)
You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you
[Outro]
