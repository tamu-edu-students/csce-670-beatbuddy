32 ContributorsWalk Lyrics[Verse 1]
A million miles away
Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern
I think I lost my way
Gettin' good at startin' over
Every time that I return

[Chorus]
Learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

[Verse 2]
Do you remember the days
We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn?
I think I found my place
Can't you feel it growin' stronger?
Little conquerors

[Chorus]
Learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learnin' to talk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?

Now
For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free, again
To keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside, a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice, but knowin' to survive
The first to climb another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die
I never wanna die, I never wanna die!
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die!
I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die!
I never wanna leave, I'll never say goodbye!
Forever! Whenever! Forever! Whenever!

[Chorus]
Learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?
[Outro]
Learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?27Embed Walk Wasting Light Foo Fighters metal
