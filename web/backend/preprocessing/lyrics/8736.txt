My mates have all gone married now
Off living in a kindred cloud
Not that kind
They cuddle up with kitten's bone
Puddle in their beds at home
I still can't find

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna see
Tell me what you want
And I'll take my time
And I'll move it forward, now

Do you want to come with me?
Do you want to come?
And I'll take my time
And I'll move it closer, now

[Verse 2]
I check my stupid phone again
No matter that it's 4:00 am
It burns my eyes
A spotlight's born to shine at night
Come what may, it always might
Burn so bright

Tell me what you wanna see
Tell me what you want
And I'll take my time
And I'll move it forward, now

Do you want to come with mе?
Do you want to come?
And I'll take my time
And I'll movе it closer, now

[Post-Chorus]
Slow rodeo
Roll over, roll over
Slow rodeo
In the snow
Slow rodeo
Hold over, roll over
Slow rodeo
In the snow

[Interlude]
High waisted, she tasted like a salacious confrontation salvation
From the salivating demarcation of Columbian incarnation of the patron saint of palliation
Her milk framed and rose satin, untamed by the silk that framed
Her Manhattan trap door which became duly unbattened
She's Latin, out cattin'
[Verse 3]
Does everything that feels so nice
Come with an inverted price?
I still don't know
The ball is clearly in my court
And I am happy to report
It's moving slow

[Chorus]
Tell me what you want to see
Tell me what you want
And I'll take my time
And I'll move it forward, now
Do you want to come with me
Do you want to come
And I'll take my time
And I'll move it closer, now

[Post-Chorus]
Slow rodeo
Roll over, roll over
Slow rodeo
In the snow
Slow rodeo
Hold over, roll over
[Outro]
Of the humbling Colombian
Two socks and a tumble in her slumber skin
The summer wind, we crumble some
The rock and rumble of a tumbling bubble gum
Some other umbrella trellis forgot to tell us that the mellow tangelo is jealous
For the various and not necessarily contrary shell show, she said "hell no"
The cock bottom temple varies like autumn, lights soft the cost
The Fibonacci lost her sauce
Into the last remaining hostage boss, sweet toss
Now I lay me down to reap the sleep of your selective sedative, repetitive
An uncredited she comes, well-vetted, gracefully and studied
Blue steadiness, the wrath, the math
The not yet fractured tabernacle of the Basil Rathbone and the last disaster casting
Impassible laughter blocks my path
Blue chaff, blue chaff, blue chaff
Blue chaff, blue chaff, blue chaff2Embed
