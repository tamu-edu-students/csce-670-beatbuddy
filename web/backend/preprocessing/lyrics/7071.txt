18 ContributorsYggdrasil Lyrics[Verse 1]
Rising up from a day of plunder
The ale of yesterday has gone down under
The battlefield awaits my soul to Odin (For whom I wait)
Thor guide me through my battles
Lead me home (To Asgard)
The victorious will rise to the glory of the gods

[Chorus]
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil

[Verse 2]
In the hour of final judgment
Allfather, lead my way
When the fire of war reign
I will watch my brothers fall
Our names will be long forgotten
We live on forever
The victorious will rise to the glory of the gods
You might also like[Chorus]
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
In the dust, I swore my hatred
From seeing unborn children die
The mother's weeping wakes my sword for vengeance (The sword cries)
I ride into infinity and as I fall I rise (In Asgard)
The victorious will rise to the glory of the gods (Rise, rise, rise)

[Chorus]
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil
To the top of Yggdrasil1Embed
