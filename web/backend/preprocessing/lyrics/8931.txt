8 ContributorsUndress Rehearsal Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la

[Verse 1]
You deserve more than a cameo
How are you not in my video?
Lets take it back to my studio
And we can let it roll tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, come with me now, your scene's 'bout to start
I do believe I can see you're a star
Don't know your name, but you're made for the part
'Cause you're perfect, babe
Time to work it, babe

[Chorus]
It's your undress rehearsal
So take your clothes off
Show me how you show off
It's your undress rehearsal
You the main attraction
Lights, camera, action

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la (Yeah, say ooh)
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la

No, you don't need to audition, babe
Don't need no headshots or pictures, babe
There's no contract to negotiate
So we should let it roll tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, come with me now, your scene's 'bout to start ('Bout to start)
I do believe I can see you're a star (You're a star)
Don't know your name, but you're made for the part
'Cause you're perfect, babe
Time to work it, babe

[Chorus]
It's your undress rehearsal
So take your clothes off
Show me how you show off
It's your undress rehearsal
You the main attraction
Lights, camera, action

Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la (Woo)
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la (Everybody, say)
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la (Yeah, say ooh)
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
[Verse 3]
Stop, let the credits roll
On star status, need a telescope
Magazines, that centerfold
All the dudes like, "She could get it though"
She could get it though? (She could get it though)
From the top down, like it sexual
See that wardrobe at awards show
Now it's your name in a envelope like

[Chorus]
It's your undress rehearsal
So take your clothes off
Show me how you show off (Say yeah)
It's your undress rehearsal (Ooh)
You the main attraction
Lights, camera, action

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la (Come on, ayy, listen, everybody say)
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la (Come on, yeah, listen, ha, everybody say)
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la (What? everybody say)
Ooh, la-la-la (Uh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, let's go)

[Outro]
Sexy girl, let's undress rehearsal
Sexy girl, let's undress rehearsal
Sexy girl, let's undress rehearsal
Sexy girl, let's undress rehearsal
Uh, oh yeah, let it ride out, let it ride out5Embed
