27 ContributorsMouth for War Lyrics[Verse 1]
Revenge, I'm screaming revenge again
Wrong, I've been wrong for far too long
Been constantly so frustrated, I've moved mountains with less
When I channel my hate to productive, I don't find it hard to impress

[Pre-Chorus]
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

[Chorus]
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined

[Verse 2]
Possessed, I feel a conquering will down inside me
Strength, the strength of many to crush who might stop me
My strength is in number and my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me
You might also like[Chorus]
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined

[Solo]

[Bridge]
There comes a time within everyone
To close your eyes to what's real

[Outro]
No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest, let others waste my time
Owning success is the bottom line
Like a knife into flesh
After life is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
No one can piss on this determination8Embed
