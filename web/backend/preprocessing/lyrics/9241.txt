Go!
Fuck!

[Verse 1]
I don't want this, I don’t need this
I don't give a single fuck about your thoughts and prayers
Salvation in destruction
And I am the apostle of pain
There's more money in tragedy and more net worth in self pity
So you’re doubling down inside of your screen
Hiding behind attention you seek

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nowhere left for you to hide the bodies

[Chorus]
Don't pray for me when you're the one to blame
Don't think of me when you go up in flames
Don't pray for me when you're the one enslaved
No miracles, just fantasy

[Post-Chorus]
Separated
Separated

So spare me your pity symphony
Wake up and get up off your knees
Handcuffed by Sunday fallacy
Crucify the saint in your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
An addict for plaudit, you get your crucifix

[Chorus]
Don't pray for me when you’re the one to blame
Don’t think of me when you go up in flames
Don't pray for me when you’re the one enslaved
Don't wish me well in your fantasy
Don't pray for me

[Bridge]
You know the dead can't hear you
The holy well is dry
So when you face the truth
Open your fuckin’ eyes

[Breakdown]
Preying on the violence
You fabricate a script
Preaching to fill your pockets
But your god is counterfeit
You love to play the victim
Can I get an amen?
Yet you canonize yourself
While you wear this crown of shit
[Chorus]
Don't pray for me when you're the one to blame (The one to blame)
Don't think of me when you go up in flames (Go up in flames)
Don't pray for me when you're the one enslaved (The one enslaved)
No miracles, just fantasy

[Outro]
You get what you pray for, you don't get anything
Playing the part when it's insincere (It's insincere)
So give up the pain, give up the game, go
Just give up the holy ghost
You won't get what you pray for
Won't get what you pray for
Won't get what you pray for, yeah
