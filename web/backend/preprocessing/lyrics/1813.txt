95 ContributorsRise Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're broken down and tired
Of living life on a merry-go-round
And you can't find the fighter
But I see it in you, so we gon' walk it out
And move mountains
We gon' walk it out
And move mountains

[Chorus]
And I'll rise up, I'll rise like the day
I'll rise up, I'll rise unafraid
I'll rise up
And I'll do it a thousand times again
And I'll rise up, high like the waves
I'll rise up in spite of the ache
I'll rise up
And I'll do it a thousand times again

[Post-Chorus]
For you
For you
For you
For you

[Verse 2]
When the silence isn't quiet
And it feels like it's getting hard to breathe
And I know you feel like dying
But I promise we'll take the world to its feet
And move mountains
Bring it to its feet
And move mountains
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'll rise up, I'll rise like the day
I'll rise up, I'll rise unafraid
I'll rise up
And I'll do it a thousand times again

[Post-Chorus]
For you
For you
For you
For you

[Bridge]
All we need, all we need is hope
And for that, we have each other
And for that, we have each other, and (We will rise)
We will rise, we will rise (We will rise)
We'll rise, oh-oh-ooh-oh (We will rise)
We'll rise

[Chorus]
I'll rise up, rise like the day
I'll rise up in spite of the ache
I will rise a thousands times again
And we'll rise up, high like the waves
We'll rise up in spite of the ache
We'll rise up (Rise up)
And we'll do it a thousands times again
[Post-Chorus]
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you28Embed Rise Up Cheers to the Fall Andra Day soul
