21 ContributorsAmerica’s Sweetheart Lyrics[Verse 1]
No, there ain't nothing that I gotta prove
You think your words'll make me black and blue
But I, I think I'm pretty with these old boots on
I think it's funny when I drink too much, hey
You try and change me, you can go to hell
'Cause I don't wanna be nobody else
I like the chip I got in my front teeth
And I got bad tattoos you won't believe

[Pre-Chorus]
So kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock 'n' roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Gonna lose control tonight

[Chorus]
What do you want from me?
I'm not America's sweetheart
So beat the drum with me
I'm not America's sweetheart
Well, they said I'm too loud for this town
So I lit a match and burned it down
What do you want from me?
I'm not America's sweetheart
But you love me anyway

My hands are dirty and my heart is cold
Them boys I've been with say I got no soul
When I, I meet another honey at the bar
I'll think it's funny when I break his heart, mmm, now
My kinda medicine is whiskey straight
I got a mouth to put you in your place
And they, they said I'll never be the poster type
But they don't make posters of my kind of life

[Pre-Chorus]
So kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock 'n' roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Gonna lose control tonight

[Chorus]
What do you want from me?
I'm not America's sweetheart
So beat the drum with me
I'm not America's sweetheart
Well, they said I'm too loud for this town
So I lit a match and burned it down
What do you want from me?
I'm not America's sweetheart
But you love me anyway
You love me anyway
You love me anyway
[Pre-Chorus]
Kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock 'n' roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Holler if you're ready, gonna lose control
Kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock 'n' roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Gonna lose control tonight

[Chorus]
What do you want from me?
I'm not America's sweetheart
So beat the drum with me
I'm not America's sweetheart
Well, they said I'm too loud for this town
So I lit a match and burned it down
What do you want from me?
I'm not America's sweetheart
But you love me anyway
You love me anyway
You love me anyway

[Outro]
I'm not America's sweetheart
No, no, no4Embed
