You are my angel
Come from way above
To bring me love, to bring me love

[Verse 2: Horace Andy]
Her eyes
She's on the dark side
Neutralize every man in sight, every man in sight

[Refrain: Horace Andy]
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

[Verse 3: Horace Andy]
You are my angel
Come from way above

[Instrumental]

[Refrain: Horace Andy]
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
