(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

[Verse 1]
I was listenin' to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands, dah
I had a dream I was seven
Climbin' my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waitin' impatient for me, dah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain

[Chorus]
But no, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

[Verse 2]
I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you
And for a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true, dah
And all this time I have been lyin'
Oh, lyin' in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
La-di-da

But no, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
No, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
No, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

[Bridge]
But I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
[Chorus]
But no, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
No, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go

[Outro]
No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no
No, take me home, home where I belong, oh, oh, oh
No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no
No, take me home, home where I belong
I can't take it anymore103Embed Runaway All My Demons Greeting Me As A Friend (Deluxe) AURORA pop
