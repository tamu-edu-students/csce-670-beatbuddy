Can't take me apart!
Can't take me apart!

[Verse 1]
See the light, a new day has arrived for us
Genesis of our evolution
A linchpin holds within a means to an end
Can't you see that we are one?

Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
No, you can't!

[Pre-Chorus]
We see no end to the dream

[Chorus]
We will never see the end
We will never be the end
All my life, I've felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it

No, you can't!
You might also like[Verse 2]
Without me you will fade, you will not remain
We are one, and of the same future machine
A linchpin holds within a means to an end
Can't you see that we are one?

Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
No, you can't!

[Pre-Chorus]
We see no end to the dream

[Chorus]
We will never see the end
We will never be the end
All my life, I've felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it

[Bridge]
No, you
No, you can't take
No, you can't take
No, you can't take
No, you can't take
No, you can't take
No, you can't take me apart
[Chorus]
We will never see the end
We will never be the end
All my life, I've felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it

[Outro]
You can't change me
You can't change me
You can't change me
You can't change me
You can't change me
You can't change me
You can't change me now1Embed
