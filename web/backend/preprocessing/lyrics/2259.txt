4 ContributorsOnce Upon a Time LyricsOnce upon a time
There lived a ghost
He was known to be a killer
And feared the most

The eagle is comin'
You better start runnin'
His blood is rushin'
Stunnin' and gunnin'
The eagle is comin'
You better start runnin'
His blood is rushin'
Stunnin' and gunnin'

Once upon a time
There lived a ghost
He was known to be a killer
And feared the mostYou might also likeEmbed
