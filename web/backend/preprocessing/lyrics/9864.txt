You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddie!

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who
Would hurt the children in any way they could (Oof!)
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kid

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
But in the town, it was well known, when they got home at night
Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their livesYou might also like13Embed The Happiest Days of Our Lives The Wall Pink Floyd psych-rock
