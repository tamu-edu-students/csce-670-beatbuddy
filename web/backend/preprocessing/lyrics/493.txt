6 ContributorsDon’t You Worry Child (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

[Pre-Chorus]
Up on that hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Chorus]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See, Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah

[Drop]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See, Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah

[Verse 2]
There was a time I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'd never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs remindin' me of a friend
