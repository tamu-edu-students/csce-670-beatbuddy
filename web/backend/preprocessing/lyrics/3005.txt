26 ContributorsFool LyricsYour name is a triangle
Your heart is a square
I love to see you
Way over there
Once I was happy
You found it intriguing
Then you got to me
And left me waiting
You make me feel like a fool waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool waiting for you
I thought we could eat bread
I thought we could talk
On darker days
With our boots kicked off
You look to me
And I look away
Though I had been looking
You make me feel like a fool waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool waiting for youYou might also like6Embed
