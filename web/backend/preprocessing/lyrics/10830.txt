36 ContributorsRed Cold River Lyrics[Verse 1]
Days reborn
Fight with folded hands
Pain left below
The lifeless live again

[Pre-Chorus]
Run, run, run
Red cold river
Run, run, run
Red cold river

[Chorus]
I can't feel anything at all
This life has left me cold and damned
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end

[Verse 2]
Stay reformed
Erase this perfect world
Hate left below
The dark stray dog of war

[Pre-Chorus]
Run, run, run
Red cold river
Run, run, run
Red cold river

I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end

[Bridge]
Try to find a reason to live
Try to find a reason to live
Try to find a reason to live
No!

[Chorus]
I can't feel anything at all
This life has left me cold and damned
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end12Embed
