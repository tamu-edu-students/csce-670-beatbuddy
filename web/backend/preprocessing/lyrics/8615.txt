67 ContributorsJackie and Wilson Lyrics[Verse 1]
So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

[Verse 2]
She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And Lord, she found me just in time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by

[Pre-Chorus]
Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world; good God, it wasn't for us

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Cut clean from the dream at night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next
[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues44Embed Jackie And Wilson Hozier Hozier songwriter
