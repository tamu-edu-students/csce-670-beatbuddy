Dance, boogie wonderland, hah, hah
Dance, boogie wonderland

[Verse 1]
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
Who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
Who has laid too many bets

The mirror stares you in the face
And says "Baby, uh, uh, it don't work"
You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt

[Chorus]
Dance, boogie wonderland, hah, hah
Dance, boogie wonderland (Ooh, ooh, ooh dance, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance)
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
(Dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance)
