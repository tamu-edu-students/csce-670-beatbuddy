Living my best life
Living my best life

[Verse 1]
This house is now a litany of things I thought I'd never be
A man who has opinions on an ottoman, among other things
I used to think I'd miss the road, the crushing fame, the sold out shows
Now I just sing "head, shoulders, knees, and toes" like I'd forgotten 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm alive and
Baby, I'm thrivin'
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
I'm livin' my best life, I wake up with the sunrise
It does not look a thing like I thought that it would
But I've been gettin' my steps in, and I sleep with my best friend
It's the best that it has been in a long time
I'm livin' my best life

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah (Living my best life)
Livin' my best life, yeah, yeah (Living my best life)

Sometimes this sucks to tell the truth and I took it hard like people do
But I'm learnin' how to eat the fruit that is in season
Never thought I'd be a grown-ass man, but you know what they say of best-laid plans
Now I'm holdin' on to my daughter's hand and I've got a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
To be alive and (oh yeah)
Baby, I'm thrivin'
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm livin' my best life, I wake up with the sunrise
It does not look a thing like I thought that it would
But I've been gettin' my steps in, and I sleep with my best friend
It's the best that it has been in a long time
I'm livin' my best life

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah (Living my best life)
Livin' my best life, yeah, yeah (Living my best life)
C'mon

[Bridge]
I'm livin' my best life the best that I can
No more worry or stress life 'cause I'm done with them
I'm as light as can be, I'm as fresh as a breeze
Right where I want to be, so if you need to find me
[Chorus]
I'll be livin' my best life, wakin' up with the sunrise
Lookin' at things like, what the actual hell
But I've been countin' my blessings, now I sleep with my best friend
It's the best that it has been for a long time
It's the best that it has been for a long time
I'm livin' my best life

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah (Living my best life)
Livin' my best life, ooh (Living my best life)
I've been livin' my, livin' my, livin' my best life (Living my best life)
Ooh (Living my best life)Embed
