I'll be your mirror
Reflect what you are, in case you don't know
I'll be the wind, the rain, and the sunset
The light on your door to show that you're home

[Chorus]
When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside, you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to believe you don't know
The beauty you are
But if you don't, let me be your eyes
A hand to your darkness so you won't be afraid

[Chorus]
When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside, you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you
