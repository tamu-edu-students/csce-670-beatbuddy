Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

[Verse 1]
I had a dream, I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

[Chorus]
Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

[Verse 2]
As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
A helping hand someone who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got someone there to say
I'll show you

Say it together, naturally

[Bridge]
So you think you know the answers, oh no
Because the whole world has got you dancing, that's right
I'm telling you
It's time to start believing, oh yes
Believing who you are, you are a shining star

[Chorus Outro]
Say you, say me
Say it for always, (Oh) that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally
