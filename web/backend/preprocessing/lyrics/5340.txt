I don't know what you want
Let's have a bit of fun 'til I downfall
My love, if you feel like I do right now
Don't say you're on the run to the other side, my love

You say you wanna try but you never do
Sugar, there's a reason why we lose
You say you wanna cry but you never do
Sugar, there's a reason why we lose
