30 ContributorsSwitchez Lyrics[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
1,2,3, and to the 4
Eazy muthafuckin' E
With the chrome to your dome
Cruisin' in my '64 rag top
I got a lot of juice
A lot of fuckin' block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
Keep the gat in my lap
Cuz I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers
Fuck no hapsters
I pack a Tech-9
Plus a AK-47
Send a one way ticket to my hell
Or maybe heaven, peep
Nigga I don't sleep
Bury muthafuckas in the concrete
You try creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I peep you niggas out in my left window
So I blast and I blast til I blast no mo
Yo, they call a muthafucka John Doe

[Chorus: Eazy-E]
Cuz when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
Cuz when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
Cuz when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
Cuz when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'

Be a witness to murda
Niggas bustin' out of a '64 Chevy
Straight callin' my city
Niggas be winnin' and gettin' busy
Wit a tizy
Through my city
Chalk lines hang
Niggas bang
Chevy's swang like it ain't no thang
The gangs bang
So nigga tuck your chain
And try to duck this thang
End up puffin' one stuck in you brain
To refrain from this game of stressin'
Smokin' on water
And fin to bang your daughter
All up in the Best Western
She like the way that my '64 hop
Drop the top
Grab a rock
Now she's givin' me top
Non stop on the R-O-C
Like the way she made me scream
So I two-wayed my nigga Eazy-E
[Chorus: Eazy-E]
Cuz when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Old nigga E still cruisin'
Punk stay up on the nuts and the bone
Pussy nigga had beef knocked out of his teeth
The muthafucka should have stayed his ass home
Hey yo peep them bitchez in the Honda
4 deep with the proper ass sounds
Now every time that I meet a fine cute bitch
She got a friend from the fuckin' Dog Pound
Hey yo bitch
Here's the seven digits
Call me if you can
Only if you want it
Let a nigga know
Can I dig like a miner, 49er
Diggin' for gold from behind her
Watch this nigga do some diggin'
Pop that pussy on a platter
Watch this nigga do some diggin'
Loose or tight it doesn't matter
YO!
[Chorus: Eazy-E]
Cuz when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'

[Bridge Eazy-E]
Hit them switchez [hit them switchez]
Hit them switchez [come on nigga]
Hit the switchez [make that shit bounce man]
Make it bounce [make it bounce homie]
Hit them switchez [man come on homie]
Hit them switchez [make that shit bounce homie]
Hit the switchez [three wheel motion]
Make it bounce [say what]

[Chorus: Eazy-E]
Cuz when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
Cuz when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'

[Outro: Roc Slanga]

You know his name nigga
