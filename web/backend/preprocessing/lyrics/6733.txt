I feel bad, bad, bad about it
I feel bad, bad, bad about it

[Verse 1]
You gon' wait until way past midnight
Just to catch me up when I come home
You stay up to wait for my headlight
Shine across the window so you know (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I should tone it down but I can't
But I've been real life hoping you sleep it off
I've been way cross town and I've been down
I've been fuckin' around and I've been caught

[Chorus]
I feel bad, bad, bad about it (Bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (Do it again, do it again)
I feel bad, bad, bad about it (Bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (Do it again)
(You say, Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
You say
How could you ever, treat me like you ever
(How could you ever, treat me like you ever)
You say
How could you ever, treat me like you ever
(How could you ever, treat me like you ever)
You say

You gon' wait until way past midnight
Just to catch me up when I come home
You don't sleep until I apologize for everything that I have done (Oh)
I could say all the right things that you want me to
But then, baby, I'm good
And I'd be lying if I told you
I wouldn't do it again cause I would

[Chorus]
I feel bad, bad, bad about it (Bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (Do it again, do it again)
I feel bad, bad, bad about it (Bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (Do it again)
You say-

[Post-Chorus]
How could you ever, treat me like you ever
(How could you ever, treat me like you ever)
How could you ever, treat me like you ever
(How could you ever, treat me like you ever)

[Chorus]
I feel bad, bad, bad about it (Bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (Do it again, do it again)
I feel bad, bad, bad about it (Bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (Do it again)
(You say)2Embed
