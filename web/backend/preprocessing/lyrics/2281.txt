Trick or treat
(Shut the fuck up)
Goddamn it
Back the fuck up from my door
What the fuck is you supposed to be, a tampon?
Bitch, trick
Trick, trick this trick, trick

[Intro]
It's D-O-E
Reppin' for the B-A-Ps
Comin' for the T-O-P
Like another J-O-B
Nigga, I'm back like a Chucky bride from the afterlife
Nothin' nice, this the antichrist, it's a bloody night
Bloody right, he gon' fantasize 'bout the cellulites
'Tween my thighs, got a spooky twat for your appetite (Yummy, yummy, yummy)
It turn him on when I'm all alone, we be moanin' (Ooh, uh, ooh, uh)
He call my phone, I'ma flick this pussy with a drone in (Ooh, uh, ooh, uh)

He wanna clone it, but I'ma have this nigga foamin' (Ooh, uh, ooh, uh)

[Bridge]
If this the Wizard of Oz, I'm Wicked Witch of the West (Wеst, West, West)
You shuffling up them cards, I’m at thе top of the deck (Deck, deck, deck)
I know that I pose a threat when I post it up on the net
If you book with doechii.com, you know you bookin' the best

[Verse 2]
By the time you hear this, I'll have taken on another form
The way I've been snapping, y'all gon' end up my children of the corn
I think I've adapted to all of the cannibal savages
I feel a possession in this session, I need a Catholic
To assess it, come and bless it and undress it, pussy precious
She a fetish, she get deadly, Armageddon, I want dick
Then I'ma get it, he don't get it, he regret it, coochie vegan
It's a veggie, come and eat this coochie dressing, Iamdoechii
I am legend, don't shoot me, just get the message
You got beef, then, bitch, address it
UPS it, I'm too young to be this restless
Eat you bitches, shit you out through my fucking large intestine
I spit bars that make you quit, I insist that you respect it
Save your music, keep it close, I suggest that you protect it
When I'm in the studio, I go Jason, I go Freddy
Slice you bitches in your bedding, shoot your mammy and your daddy
At your wedding, I been waitin', I been ready, disappear like
I'm a Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti...
I go off like PMS, you still rap like PBS
Work them checks like BTS, pay in full or thank you, next
I don't contemplate or flex, when I rap, I step on necks
My bars feel like S-E-X, they book me like SOS
I told 'em once, I told 'em once, I guess I'll tell 'em twice
I’m on the run, another one, I'm in it for the ride
Ayy, fuck the fame and fuck the hoes, I do it for the vibe
They want me dead but I still do it in another life3Embed Like 2 Cool 4 Skool BTS k-pop
