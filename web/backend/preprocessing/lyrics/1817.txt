37 ContributorsOrdinary World Lyrics[Verse 1]
Came in from a rainy Thursday
On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

[Pre-Chorus]
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognise?
Gone away

[Chorus]
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

[Verse 2]
Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
"Pride will tear us both apart"
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

[Chorus]
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

[Bridge]
Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

(Just blown away)

[Chorus]
And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
[Outro]
Every world
Is my world
(I will learn to survive)
Any world
Is my world
(I will learn to survive)
Any world
Is my world
Every world
Is my world17Embed Ordinary World Duran Duran Duran Duran synth-pop
