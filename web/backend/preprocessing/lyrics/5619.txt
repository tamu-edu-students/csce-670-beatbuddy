88 ContributorsPepper Lyrics[Verse 1]
Marky got with Sharon
Sharon got Cherese
She was sharing Sharon's outlook
On the topic of disease

Mikey had a facial scar
And Bobby was a racist
They were all in love with dyin'
They were doing it in Texas

Tommy played piano
Like a kid out in the rain
And then he lost his leg in Dallas
He was dancing with a train
They were all in love with dyin'
They were drinking from a fountain
That was pouring like an avalanche
Comin' down the mountain

[Chorus]
I don't mind the sun sometimes
The images it shows
I can taste you on my lips
And smell you in my clothes
You might also likeCinnamon and sugary
And softly spoken lies
You never know just how to look
Through other people's eyes

[Verse 2]
Some will die in hot pursuit
In fiery auto crashes
Some will die in hot pursuit
While sifting through my ashes

Some will fall in love with life
And drink it from a fountain
That is pouring like an avalanche
Comin' down the mountain

[Chorus]
I don't mind the sun sometimes
The images it shows
I can taste you on my lips
And smell you in my clothes

Cinnamon and sugary
And softly spoken lies
You never know just how you look
Through other people's eyes
[Bridge]
Seye s'elpoep retho hguorht
Kool uoy woh tsuj wonk reven uoy
Swohs ti segami eht
Semitemos nus eht dnim t'nod I

[Verse 3]
Another Mikey took a knife
While arguing in traffic
Flipper died a natural death
He caught a nasty virus
Then there was the ever-present
Football player rapist
They were all in love with dyin'
They were doing it in Texas

Pauly caught a bullet
But it only hit his leg
Well, it should have been a better shot
And got him in the head

They were all in love with dyin'
They were drinking from a fountain
That was pouring like an avalanche
Comin' down the mountain
[Chorus]
I don't mind the sun sometimes
The images it shows
I can taste you on my lips
And smell you in my clothes

Cinnamon and sugary
And softly spoken lies
You never know just how you look
Through other people's eyes34Embed
