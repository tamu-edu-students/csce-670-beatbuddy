Our phantoms forever, forever
Like scarecrows that fuel this flame
We're burning forever and ever

There's a dozen reasons in this gun
[Outro]
And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood

And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down
I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood
I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever!35Embed
