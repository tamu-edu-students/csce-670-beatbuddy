I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there, baby
I could use just a little help

[Chorus]
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[Verse 2]
Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on, and I'm moving 'round my place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
Ah, just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[Bridge]
You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere, and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

[Verse 3]
Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say, "You gotta stay hungry"
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, give me just one look

[Chorus]
You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
[Outro]
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey, baby
