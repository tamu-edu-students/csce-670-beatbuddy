Outrunning karma
That boy, he's such a charmer
All the bugs and their larva
Follow him out to Colorado
Ten dozen hearts in a bag
Their bodies lying
He'll drag them down to Colorado
A modern desperado

[Pre-Chorus]
And he'll race for miles through the night
He runs because he knows he cannot hide

[Chorus]
He's never gonna make it
All the poor people he's forsaken
Karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting
From the church steeple down to Satan
Karma, there's really no escape until he dies

[Verse 2]
Outrunning karma
That boy can't run no farther
It's the last days of Sparta
Follow him down to meet Apollo

And he'll brace for battle in the night
He'll fight because he knows he cannot hide

[Chorus]
He's never gonna make it
All the poor people he's forsaken
Karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting
From the church steeple down to Satan
Karma, there's really no escape until he dies
