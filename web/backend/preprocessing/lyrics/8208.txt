That was unforgettable
I wanna do it again
You're crazy like an animal
And I don't want it to end
Tell me all your dreams and darkest fantasies, ooh

[Chorus]
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
That was unbelievable
I wanna do it again
I'll eat you like a cannibal
You're sweet like cinnamon
Tell me all your dreams and darkest fantasies, oh
