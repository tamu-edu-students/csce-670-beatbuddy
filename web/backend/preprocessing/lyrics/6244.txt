I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen

[Chorus]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

[Verse 2]
You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
Then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining

[Chorus]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No, it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

[Outro]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
I know it's goodYou might also like22Embed The Heart of Life Continuum John Mayer songwriter
