50 ContributorsWho Says Lyrics[Intro]
I wouldn't wanna be anybody else
Hey

[Verse 1]
You made me insecure
Told me I wasn't good enough
But who are you to judge
When you're a diamond in the rough?
I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't wanna be anybody else

[Pre-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
I'm no beauty queen, I'm just beautiful me
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
You've got every right to a beautiful life
Come on

[Chorus]
Who says?
Who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

It's such a funny thing
How nothing's funny when it's you
You tell 'em what you mean
But they keep whitin' out the truth
It's like the work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Won't let you touch the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
I'm no beauty queen, I'm just beautiful me
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
You've got every right to a beautiful life
Come on

[Chorus]
Who says?
Who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?

[Bridge]
Who says you're not star potential?
Who says you're not presidential?
Who says you can't be in movies?
Listen to me, listen to me
Who says you don't pass the test?
Who says you can't be the best?
Who said, who said?
Would you tell me who said that?
Yeah, who said?

Trust me, that's the price of beauty (Yeah)
Who says you're not pretty? (Who says you're not beautiful?)
Who says you're not beautiful?
