Help me, my God, this got messy
Least I got the best seat
'Cause we put on one hell of a show
Waiting, I just keep on waiting
For the final curtain
'Cause I just can't let go of your love

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
Ooh
You say my name like you know my dark side, ooh
Can't beat the taste of the tears that I'll cry, ooh

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
Slow grenade is blowing up
My mistakes, so why don't I
Why don't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must want it
That's why I'm not running from it
Can't escape this blowing up
In my face, so why can't I
Why can't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must love it
That's why I'm not running from it

Crazy, late nights in the city
Drink until you hate me
Then say that I should just let you go (Just let you go)
But hold on, why do we still hold on?
Think that we should move on
But we're too scared of being alone (Being alone)

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding & Lauv, Lauv]
Ooh
You say my name like you know my dark side, ooh (Oh)
Can't beat the taste of the tears that I'll cry, ooh

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding & Lauv]
Slow grenade is blowing up
My mistakes, so why don't I
Why don't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must want it
That's why I'm not running from it
Can't escape this blowing up
In my face, so why can't I
Why can't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must love it
That's why I'm not running from it
[Post-Chorus: Ellie Goulding & Lauv]
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh
Why can't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must love it
That's why I'm not running from it

[Bridge: Ellie Goulding & Lauv]
Help me, my God, this got messy
Least I got the best seat
'Cause we put on one hell of a show
Woah, yeah
