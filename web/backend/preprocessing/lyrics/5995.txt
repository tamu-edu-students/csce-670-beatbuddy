I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart

[Verse 2]
You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart

[Chorus]
Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

[Verse 3]
I see you on the street some other time
And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart

[Chorus]
Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

Don't ever leave me darlin'

[Outro]
Oh, straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go- as long as I know
You'll give it to me now
Straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go-as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart
Give it to me
Oh no, oh no
Straight from the heart
You know I'll never go-as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heartEmbed Straight From The Heart Cuts Like A Knife Bryan Adams singer-songwriter
