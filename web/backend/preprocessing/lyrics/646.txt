You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Bridge]
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Outro]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams95Embed Fireflies Ocean Eyes Owl City indie
