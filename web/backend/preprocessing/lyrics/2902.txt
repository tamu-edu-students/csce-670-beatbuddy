Counting while I run the tap
I'm on my knees
Chokin' on my hands all night
In my sleep
Counting all the calories
Now get 'em up
Body positivity
Help me out

[Pre-Chorus]
The swans of ballet
Their skin and their bones, that's not me
I'd die for my love though, break
Break till I wither away
What I see is not me
What I see is not me

[Chorus]
One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
Wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this
How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me
What I see is not me

Sweet girl, you're so disciplined
Now keep it down
I don't like my measurements
Won't make a sound
Diana, how she guards the clock (The clock)
She's in control (Control)
Now why is everyone in shock? (In shock)
You let her go

[Pre-Chorus]
The swans of ballet ('Llet)
Their skin and their bones, that's not me (Me)
I'd die for my love though, break (Break)
Break till I wither away
What I see is not me
What I see is not me

[Chorus]
One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
Wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this
How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
[Post-Chorus]
What I see is not me
What I see is not me

[Bridge]
When I'm hurting, every time I have a bad day
Then everyone gets lost
But I'm learning every time I feel out of place
That you are all I've got, oh

[Chorus]
One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in (Oh)
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
Wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this
How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me
