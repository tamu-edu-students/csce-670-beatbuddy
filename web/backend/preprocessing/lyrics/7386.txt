26 ContributorsLooking Too Closely Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is a song about somebody else
So don’t worry yourself, worry yourself
The devil’s right there, right there in the details
And you don’t wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
By looking too closely
By looking too closely
No no no no…

[Verse 2]
Put your arms around somebody else
And don’t punish yourself, punish yourself
The truth is like blood underneath your fingernails
You don’t wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
By looking too closely
By looking too closely
No no no no…
No no no no…

You don’t wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
You don’t wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
Oh no no no...

[Verse 3]
And I could be wrong about anybody else
So don’t kid yourself, kid yourself
It’s you right there, right there in the mirror
You don’t wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
By looking too closely
Mmmmmmmm
By looking too closely
Mmmmmmm

You don’t wanna hurt yourself
You don’t wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
By looking too closely19Embed
