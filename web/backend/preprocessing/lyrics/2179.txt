Don't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before, mm
And don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore

[Chorus]
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mm
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I take you just the way you are

[Verse 2]
Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mm
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

[Chorus]
I don't want clever conversation
Never want to work that hard, mm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are

[Bridge]
Need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Oh, what will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?

I said, “I love you,” that's forever
And this, I promise from the heart, mm
I couldn't love you any better
I love you just the way you are

[Break]
Alright

[Chorus]
I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard, mm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are, oh10Embed Just the Way You Are The Stranger (Legacy Edition) Billy Joel piano
