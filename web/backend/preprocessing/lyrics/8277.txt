4 ContributorsDown Lyrics[Verse 1]
Two a.m., you're stuck again
Don't know how to feel
Burning through the summer blues
Just wishing you could heal

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna fight
But you don't know how
Just hold on tight
You're closer than you know

[Chorus]
You're gonna make it out
You're gonna fly
You're gonna find a way, just give it time
You're gonna show them all
Just how brave you are
If you need someone to call I'll be around
And I won't let you down

[Verse 2]
I see the pain, behind your eyes
It's crippled me before
I know it's dark, you're terrified
You can't get off the floor
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna fight
But you don't know how
Just hold on tight
You're closer than you know

[Chorus]
You're gonna make it out
You're gonna fly
You're gonna find a way, just give it time
You'rе gonna show them all
Just how brave you are
If you need somеone to call I'll be around
And I won't let you down
I won't let you down

[Outro]
You're gonna make it out
You're gonna fly
You're gonna find a way, just give it time
You're gonna show them all
Just how brave you are
If you need someone to call I'll be around
And I won't let you down1Embed
