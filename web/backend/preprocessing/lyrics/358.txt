2 ContributorsWhole Time Lyrics[Chorus]
Been workin’ for a while
I been here the whole time
The king of stayin’ patient
I’ll be there in no time
Momma keep on waitin’
Let’s uncover a gold mine
Bitch... I been here the whole time

[Verse 1]
From day one I been bossin’
All my goals I accomplish
I can’t take no losses, all I see is profits
Lot a new cats in the game, they make me nauseous
Only out a year and change, your songs are nonsense
Fuck up out my face
Fuck up out my space
I gotta leave LA
No longer I could stay
A whole bunch of fakes
Just tryna cheat they way
You lyin’ everyday
I’m grindin’ everyday
I got money on the way
But that shit ain’t from music
I’m out here makin’ plays
Fuck you I could do this
Can’t take nothing for granted
I gotta do my fam some good
You little bitches couldn’t understand why should
You might also like[Hook]
Been workin’ for a while
I been here the whole time
The king of stayin’ patient
I’ll be there in no time
Momma keep on waitin’
Let’s uncover a gold mine
Bitch, I been here the whole time
Been workin’ for a while
I been here the whole time
The king of stayin’ patient
I’ll be there in no time
Momma keep on waitin’
Let’s uncover a gold mine
Bitch, I been here the whole time

[Verse 2]
I remember as a youngin’ I was strugglin’
In a slump to make this music wit’ no fundin’
Had no vision had no nothin’
They would never see me comin’
That was my attack plan
Dropped Cali visions
That’s the first time that I had fans, man
But even then I had been doin’ this since Justin Bieber Ludacris
Oh baby I ain’t new to this
So tell me how these new age kids
Make the songs considered hits
Money drugs and tons of tits
Yo’ favorite out’s a piece of shit
Yeah, listen I am not no perfect person
But I beg to differ if you thinkin’ that I don’t deserve it
Just close the curtains I don’t need all the attention
I’m here to feed my family, I’m here to get to heaven
[Hook]
Been workin’ for a while
I been here the whole time
The king of stayin’ patient
I’ll be there in no time
Momma keep on waitin’
Let’s uncover a gold mine
Bitch, I been here the whole time
Been workin’ for a while
I been here the whole time
The king of stayin’ patient
I’ll be there in no time
Momma keep on waitin’
Let’s uncover a gold mine
Bitch, I been here the whole timeEmbed
