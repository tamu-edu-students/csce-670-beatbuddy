Drink up, baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do, you won't but you might
The potential you'll be, that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now and forget all about
The pressure of days, do what I say
And I'll make you okay and drive them away
The images stuck in your head

[Chorus]
People you've been before that you
Don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

[Verse 2]
Drink up, baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again, between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot
You might also like[Chorus]
The people you've been before that you
Don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still79Embed Between The Bars Either/Or Elliott Smith indie-pop
