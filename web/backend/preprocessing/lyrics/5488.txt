I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
When there's no one else around

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna take you, girl, and hold you
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour
Yes I am, oh, yes I am
One more thing I just want to say right here

[Chorus]
I'm gonna wait 'til the stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That when my love begins to shine

[Verse 2]
You're the only girl I know
That really love me so
In the midnight hour
Oh yeah, in the midnight hour
Yeah, all right, play it for me one time
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm gonna wait 'til midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait, way in the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine

[Verse 3]
Just you and I
Oh baby, huh, just you and I
Nobody around baby, just you and I
All right
You know what, I'm gonna hold you in my arms
Just you and I, oh yeah
In the midnight hour
Oh baby, in the midnight hour1Embed
