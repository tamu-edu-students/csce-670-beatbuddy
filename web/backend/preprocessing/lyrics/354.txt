You never know how good you have it, oh-oh
Until you're starin' at a picture of the only girl that matters, ah-ah

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what we're supposed to do
It's hard for me to let go of you
So I'm just tryna hold on

[Chorus]
Hold on
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone
I don't wanna move on
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone for good
You're slippin' through my fingertips
A little bit by a little bit
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been
So I'm just tryna hold on

[Verse 2]
I need to learn how to cope without you
I'm tryna protect myself but only you know how to, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know what we're supposed to do
Oh, but I hate the thought of losing you
So I'm just tryna hold on
You might also like[Chorus]
Hold on
I don't wanna know what it's like when you'rе gone
I don't wanna move on
I don't wanna know what it's like whеn you're gone for good
You're slippin' through my fingertips
A little bit by a little bit
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been
So I'm just tryna hold on

[Bridge]
Startin' to feel like you don't need me
Wanna believe it's all for the better
It's gettin' real, I'm missing you deeply
So I'm just tryna hold on
Startin' to feel like you don't need me
Wanna believe it's all for the better
It's gettin' real, I'm missing you deeply
So I'm just tryna hold on

[Chorus]
Hold on
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone
I don't wanna move on
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone for good
You're slippin' through my fingertips
A little bit by a little bit
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been (Oh, I've ever been)
So I'm just tryna hold on
[Outro]
I'm just tryna hold on18Embed
