Feels like we're a world away
But we in the same room, be my girl today at least
She don't even know my name
But she look me in the eyes like she know my pain, that's me
And she always let me be myself, she don't ever take bread
She don't need no help, that's real
While I'm busy tryna get my wealth
She ain't worried 'bout a thing except my dick and my health, that's real

[Chorus]
She sees the things that you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood that you don't bleed
She looks at me like she loves me
She sees the things that you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood that you don't bleed
She looks at me like she loves me
