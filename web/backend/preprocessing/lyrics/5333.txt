Freaky keypad
By the retina scan
I've been given good reason to believe
I ain't quite where I think I am
But it's always worth half a blast
You know the face, but you can't see past

[Refrain]
The disco strobes in the stumbling blocks
Wait, there's the other island now

[Chorus]
Formation displays of affection fly over (Eyes roll back)
And I can see both islands now

[Verse 2]
It's the intermission
Let's shake a few hands
Blank expressions invite me to suspect
I ain't quite where I think I am
Stackable party guests
To fill the awkward silencеs

[Refrain]
The disco strobes in the stumbling blocks
Wait, thеre's the other island now
You might also like[Chorus]
Formation displays of affection fly over (Eyes roll back)
And I can see both islands now
From my vantage point

[Bridge]
The spare set of tingles'll race up your spine
If I get it my way

[Verse 3]
Looks like the Riviera
Is coming into land
Early predictions would seem to suggest
I ain't quite where I think I am

[Chorus]
Formation displays of affection fly over (Eyes roll back)
And I can see both islands now12Embed
