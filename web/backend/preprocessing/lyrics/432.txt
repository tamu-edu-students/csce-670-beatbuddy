Remember the words you told me
"Love me till the day I die"?
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me "baby"
Now, you're callin' me by name (Mm)
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game
[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
You push and you push and I'm pullin' away
Pullin' away from ya
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

[Chorus: Luke, All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me outta your life
And I'm just a dead man walkin' tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time, yeah (Ooh)
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawlin' tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time, yeah (Ooh)

Lately, our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So who you been callin' "baby"?
Nobody could take my place
When you're lookin' at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face (Ooh)

[Chorus: Luke, All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me outta your life
And I'm just a dead man walkin' tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time, yeah (Ooh)
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawlin' tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time, yeah (Ooh)

[Bridge: Luke]
You push and you push and I'm pullin' away
Pullin' away from ya
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're runnin' around and I'm runnin' away
Runnin' away from ya, mm, from ya
[Chorus: Luke, All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me outta your life
And I'm just a dead man walkin' tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time, yeah (Ooh)

Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawlin' tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time, yeah (Ooh)
