14 ContributorsCan You Get to That Lyrics[Verse 1]
I once had a life, or rather, life had me
I was one among many, or at least, I seemed to be
Well, I read an old quotation in a book just yesterday
Said, "Gonna reap just what you sow, the debts you make, you have to pay" (Can you get to that?)

[Chorus]
Can you get (I wanna know)
I wanna know if you can get to that (Hey, get to that)
Can you get (Can you get to that? I wanna know)
I wanna know if you can get to that

[Verse 2]
I recollect with a-mixed emotions all the good times we used to have
But you were making preparations for the coming separation and you blew everything we had
When you base your love on credit and your loving days are done
Checks you signed with a-love and kisses, later come back signed, "Insufficient funds" (Yeah, get to that)

[Chorus]
Can you get (I wanna know)
I wanna know if you can get to that (Hey, get to that)
Can you get (Can you get to that? I wanna know)
I wanna know if you can get to that
Can you get (I wanna know)
I wanna know if you can get to that (Hey, get to that)
Can you get
I wanna know if you can get to that
Can you get
I wanna know if you can get to that

When you base your life on credit and your loving days are done
The checks you signed with love and kisses, later come back signed, "Insufficient funds"
Y'all get to that

[Chorus]
Can you get (I wanna know)
I wanna know if you can get to that (Hey, get to that)
Can you get (Can you get to that? I wanna know)
I wanna know if you can get to that
Can you get (I wanna know)
I wanna know if you can get to that (Hey, get to that)
Can you get
I wanna know if you can get to that4Embed Can You Get To That Maggot Brain Funkadelic psych-rock
