1 ContributorChanges (remake) ft. 2Pac & Talent Lyrics2Pac

I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is

Noah Odige

People walking by
But they ain't looking in my eye
Cuz as a brother in America
I’m just destined to die
The court date is set
With a jury for the trial
Got a public defender
Who didn't even open the case file
But that's how it is in the system
Poverty always fall, victim
Tryna get some money in a way that's sad
It's just breaking bad
How we make that cash
But that's not a reason for me to get discouraged
I wanna go back to when our black brothers flourished
But everyone out here we need them to see
That we still held captive cuz freedom ain't free
But that's how its post to be
How can the law get a brother if he close to me
But the men that speak those same words
Is a brother that die before he can get heard
Now if I speak to the world that helped me make this
The sexist, misogynist, and the racist
I just speak cause we all want the hate to stop
All the violence just heard the latest pop

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

Cu u know racism and discrimination
Is not just an issue of this generation
But more than hundred years in the making
It's all there ain't no faking
When we thought we made progress
It progress faster faster
Living like slaves
With hate our master
But see racism ain't a one-way street
Blacks can hate
While whites take heat
No matter the color the blood the same
We all God’s children
No matter what the claim
And we ain't enemies
We all friends
That's how we make this country great again
And that's real talk to the hater's minds
We act like this all new ain't the latest finds
But the latest news is bout gun abuse
And how any day now another bomb blew a fuse
But see all this is one-sided
We stand with love
Not hate divided
And if you stand with me
Better come with me Cuz
That's the Way It Is
Talent

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

Noah Odige

Look every single day ain't a game
WE live in a world that love and kill the same
Where Tomorrow ain't guaranteed or promised
Our new moniker is boy you don't want this
Gotta heater in our pockets
But when charge comes
They won't ever drop it
Cuz we our own pilots in the cockpit
We make our own bed and the beds we gon rock it
And reap what we sow
And this heap we all know
Of our brothers in love
Front seat to the gun show
Try to fight back
Is a loss and a dunzo
And no matter where we fly
People always tryna hunt us and we die
And we try to fight back with our words and pride
With our grief our fuel and our pain our guide
But see that's how it is right now
Everyone stand up just to fall down
And we act Like all this will go away
But we gotta make a change man starting today
And see we about more than just color
We a world filled with sisters and brothers
And we gotta look up and look to each other
We gotta fill with love and the hate we gon cover
And we anyone say otherwise
You don't gotta heed a word from them other guys
Cuz the harder you hate the harder you fall
We gotta let love in not build a wall

It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to surviveEmbed Changes Greatest Hits 2Pac;Talent funk
