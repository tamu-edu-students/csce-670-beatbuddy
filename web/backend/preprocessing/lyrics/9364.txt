56 ContributorsStabbing in the Dark Lyrics[Intro: Spencer Charnas]
In calculated silence
Captivated by the violence I replay
Fifteen years ago today
Oh, an evil evolution
Will bring a feeble institution to its knees
Oh, Doctor, can't you see

[Chorus: Spencer Charnas]
That when the hands of fate
Fall on the midnight hour
Behind this mask of hate
I don the devil's power?

[Refrain:  Spencer Charnas, Justin "JD" DeBlieck]
These are the devil's eyes!
The devil's eyes!
Go!

[Verse 1:  Spencer Charnas, Justin "JD" DeBlieck, Both]
A former portrait of perfection
Painted without plight
Now Haddonfield's my battlefield
Your kids won't make it home tonight
With a madness void of reason
I kill with every strike
I'll haunt you day after day
Knife after knife
Day after day
Knife after knife
Taking life after life

When the hands of fate
Fall on the midnight hour
Behind this mask of hate
I don the devil's power
If there's life in the shadows
Let the knife leave its mark
Where the certainty of safety feels like stabbing
Stabbing in the dark
[Verse 2:  Spencer Charnas, Justin "JD" DeBlieck, Both]
You'll learn a heartless human harvest
Feeds this festival of flesh
Stalking at the top
Scream of the crop
A silent cut above the rest
Where blood's thicker than water
I've carved up quite a scene
With your worst fears cast on this white veneer
I'll change the face of  Halloween
You can't kill the boogeyman!

[Chorus: Spencer Charnas]
When the hands of fate
Fall on the midnight hour
Behind this mask of hate
I don the devil's power
If there's life in the shadows
Let the knife leave its mark
Where the certainty of safety feels like stabbing
Stabbing in the dark
[Soundbite]
"All units respond
Multiple fatalities reported on Orange Grove Ave
Suspect has been identified as one Michael Myers
He is armed and extremely dangerous
Shoot to kill; I repeat: shoot to kill, over"

[Bridge: Spencer Charnas]
I am a shadow where there once was light
Strangling all signs of life
It's either you or some kid down the street
The choice is yours
Trick-'r-fuckin'-treat?!

[Soundbite]
"Michael!
Stop it!
Ahhhhhh!"

[Chorus: Spencer Charnas, Spencer Charnas & Justin "JD" DeBlick]
When the hands of fate
Fall on the midnight hour
Behind this mask of hate
I don the devil's power
If there's life in the shadows
Let the knife leave its mark
Where the certainty of safety feels like stabbing
