Water was running, children were running
You were running out of time
Under the mountain, a golden fountain
Were you praying at the Lares shrine?

[Chorus]
But, oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

[Verse 2]
We found you hiding, we found you lying
Choking on the dirt and sand

[Chorus]
But, oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Your city lies in dust

Woah oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust... my friend

[Outro]
Your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend4Embed
