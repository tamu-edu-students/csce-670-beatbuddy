Lately, I've been reelin', watchin' the nightly news
Don't seem to find the rhythm, just wanna sing the blues
Feels like a song that never stops
Feels like it's never gonna

[Refrain: Joel Smallbone]
Gotta get that fire, fire, back in my bones
Before my hard heart turns into stone
So won't somebody please pass the megaphone?
I'll shout it on the count of three
(One, two, three)

[Pre-Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
Oh, hear my prayer tonight, I'm singin' to the sky
Give me strength to raise my voice, let me testify
Oh, hear my prayer tonight, 'cause this is do or die
The time has come to make a choice
And I choose

[Chorus: Joel Smallbone, Joel & Luke Smallbone]
Joy
Let it move you, let it move, let it move you
Yeah, I choose joy
Let it move you, let it move, let it move you

Feels like it's never gonna

[Refrain: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
Gotta get that fire, fire, back in my bones
Before my hard heart turns into stone

[Pre-Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
Oh, hear my prayer tonight, I'm singin' to the sky
