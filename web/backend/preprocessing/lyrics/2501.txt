I get defensive and insecure
My own worst critic
Behind a closing door
I'm fragile and fractured, that’s for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
I burned myself down to the ground
Oh, can I ask of you to treat me soft and tender?
Love me hard and true, hmm
Keep my heart from building walls
So high, you can't get through
Treat me soft and tender

[Chorus]
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love mе like that?
I'll just keep repeating it
In casе, you didn’t catch me
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?
Can you love me like that?

You see the world in colors
I view it black and white
Paint me a picture
Out of the lines that I live in all of the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Treat me soft and tender
And love me hard and true
I burned myself down to the ground
Oh, can I ask of you to treat me soft and tender?

[Chorus]
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?
I just keep repeating it
In case, you didn’t catch me
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?

[Bridge]
Sunshine left today
Got caught in the rain all alone
Can you come and pick me up from my blues?
Or am I late to ask you?
Love me soft and tender
[Chorus]
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?
I just keep repeating it
In case, you didn't catch me
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?

[Chorus]
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?
I just keep repeating it
In case, you didn’t catch me
Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that?3Embed
