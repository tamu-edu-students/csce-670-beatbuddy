14 ContributorsDeep Down Lyrics[Intro]
These sounds fall into my mind
These sounds fall into my mind

[Verse 1]
I can get down, I can get lonely
Every time I think about the highs, yeah
Messed me around and now you keep callin'
Wonderin' if you can make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
I told you it's the end for you and I
Swear this time we're through, but it's a lie
When you call my name
Yeah, ooh, that sounds so right, so right, so right

[Chorus]
Deep down, wishin' you were mine
Deep down, miss you all the time
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried, oh
But deep down, wishin' you were mine, were mine

[Post-Chorus]
Deep down, you got me so
Deep down, I wanna go
Deep down, you got me so, yeah
Deep down, you got me so
Deep down, I wanna go
Deep down, you got me so, yeah

Yeah, need to be strong (Mm) as soon as I see ya (See ya)
You can turn my tables back around so easy
You got the control (Control), just hearin' you speak
Just gets me kinda crazy, kinda foolish, foolish, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I told you it's the end for you and I
Swear this time we're through, but it's a lie
When you call my name
Yeah, ooh, that sounds so right, so right, so right

[Chorus]
Deep down, wishin' you were mine
Deep down, miss you all the time
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried, oh
But deep down, wishin' you were mine, were mine

[Break]
(Deep down, wishin' you were mine)
(Deep down, miss you all the time)
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried, oh
'Cause deep down, wishin' you were mine, were mine

[Chorus]
Deep down, you got me so
Deep down, wishin' you were mine (Woo)
Deep down, miss you all the time (I miss you, yeah)
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried, oh (If we tried)
But deep down, wishin' you were mine, were mine
[Outro]
These sounds fall into my mind (You got me so)
These sounds fall into my mind (I wanna go)
These sounds fall into my mind (You got me so)
These sounds fall into my mind7Embed
