13 ContributorsA Little Faster Lyrics[Verse 1]
You keep calling it a crash and burn
Just wait your turn
You might have time to speak
There barely was a lesson learned
Cause in return
No favors back to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sure it tasted oh so sweet
But it was never good enough for me
I bit the tongue behind my teeth
It was never good enough for me

[Chorus 1]
You said you'd always keep your word
Show me what you're after
I thought you promised me the world
Tell me what you're after
Go on and take it way too far
Cause here we are, waiting once again
You said you'd always keep your word
Show me what you're after
Just a little faster

[Verse 2]
Are mine the only eyes that see, so steadily
This cut and dry routine
Even when you're by my side
I still need time to feel the company
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sure it tasted oh so sweet
But it was never good enough for me
I bit the tongue behind my teeth
It was never good enough for me

[Chorus 1]
You said you'd always keep your word
Show me what you're after
I thought you promised me the world
Tell me what you're after
Go on and take it way too far
Cause here we are, waiting once again
You said you'd always keep your word
Show me what you're after
Just a little faster
Just a little faster

[Bridge]
Hold your breath now
The bad blood's wearing thin
From the pain that settles in
When we learn too much too soon
Hold your breath now
The bad blood's wearing thin
From the pain that settles in
When we learn too much too soon (too soon)

[Chorus 2]
You said you'd always keep your word
Show me what you're after
I thought you promised me the world
Tell me what you're after
Go on and take it way too far
Cause here we are, waiting once again
You said you'd always keep your word
Show me what you're after
It was never good enough for me
(It was never good enough for me)
Show me what you're after
Just a little fasterEmbed
