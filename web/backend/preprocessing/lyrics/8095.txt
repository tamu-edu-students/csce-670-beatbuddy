Inspirational sound

Enter in the dance, plug it in an we begin
Crowd up in the center, they watch be dibidim
Watch the way we drop it in a mix timin'
Rise and amplifyin' when we come in with the swing

[Bridge]
Just followin' the back an naturally harmonizin'
Climb into position with synchronized things
Live from out the ghetto, we maximizin'
Sound of the Groove Armada we superstylin'
We superstylin'
We superstylin'

[Chorus]
Sometime
Can you feel the pressure does unwind
Sometime
Sometime
Through the day and trough the night
Sometime
Sometime
You can make our pressure does unwind
Sometime
