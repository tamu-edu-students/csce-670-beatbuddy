1 ContributorAaja We Mahiya (English Translation) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll bring all the stars down
And place them in your step
Just come and see me once
I'll bring all the stars down
And place them in your step
Just come and see me once
I won't ask you for anything else
Don't drown in your tears
Always keep me in your eyes
I wanna live in your heart forever
Otherwise, I don't wanna live

[Chorus]
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to mе, darling

[Verse 2]
You made big promises then lеft after we argued
It was never resolved and our relationship couldn't be fixed
Sitting on my own doesn't feel right
Life is unappealing without you
Your love has made me crazy
Dye me in your colours
I wanna live in your heart forever
Otherwise, I don't wanna live
You might also like[Chorus]
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling

[Verse 3]
How can you forget
Those people that put a smile on your face?
Please tell me
Why did you leave without resolving the issue?
Your memories torture me
I can't be at peace
Come back, my love

[Chorus]
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darling
Come to me, darlingEmbed
