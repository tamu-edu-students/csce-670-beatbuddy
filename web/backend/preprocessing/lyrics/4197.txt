15 ContributorsBabe Lyrics[Verse 1]
Babe, I'm leaving
I must be on my way
The time is drawing near
My train is going
I see it in your eyes
The love, the need, your tears

[Bridge]
But I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
So please believe me
My heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing you

[Chorus]
'Cause you know it's you, Babe
Whenever I get weary
And I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, Babe
Giving me the courage
And the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

You know it's you, Babe
Whenever I get weary
And I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, Babe
Giving me the courage
And the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

[Verse 2]
Babe, I'm leaving
I'll say it once again
And somehow try to smile
I know the feeling
We're trying to forget
If only for a while

[Bridge]
'Cause I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
Please believe me
My heart is in your hands
'Cause I'll be missing you
[Outro]
Babe, I love you
Babe, I love you
Ooh, baby1Embed
