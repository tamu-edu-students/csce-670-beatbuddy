I don't always wake up in the mornin', pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets to burnin', lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all

[Chorus]
I've wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different, my heart wouldn't listen
To my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
That's why I've been

Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Bridge]
Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in a bag
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you

[Chorus]
Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Outro]
Wasted on you, wasted on you18Embed Wasted On You Dangerous: The Double Album Morgan Wallen country
