3 ContributorsThe Sensual Woman LyricsTo become aware of my own sensuality
I first become fully aware of my own tactile sense
In dim light, I close my eyes and remove my clothes

Do I lose his respect for being so wild?
Hardly. He treats me like a rare and precious jewel
And he goes through the day proud of the fact, that with me
He is the world's most imaginative lover

Men pick amazing places for sexual adventure
The wildest adventure proposed to me was in a bathtub which was full of Jello!
All I could think of, was how many boxes it would take?
What would be the most alluring colour?
The most delicious flavour?
And how could that affect our oral explorations?
If the Jello gets firm, would I bounce?

As you look around for what's new and different
Remember these three important weapons that should be learned to keep a man in love
Imagination, sensitivity to his moods and desires
And the courage to experiment with new sexual techniques
Enticing situations and places

Lovemaking is physical, and so is its language
Suck, cock, fuck, and prick, are not bad words
Used in the bedroom by lovers to describe parts of the body
And physical activities
They are very proper indeed, and they distinctly enhance sex
Overhaul a prudish attitude
Don't whistle and stick up your nose, at least, not up in the airYou might also likeEmbed The Sensual Woman Very Mercenary The Herbaliser trip-hop
