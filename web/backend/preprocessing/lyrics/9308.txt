8 ContributorsNothing Feels Better Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
The world is mine but I want you
I close my eyes and déjà vu helped me realize
I'm right where I should be, yeah
I want you more than just a night
I'd die for you, I give my life and I realize
I'm right where I should be, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
When the world is over, I'll wait here for ya
Through space and time, I'll still adore ya

[Chorus]
Oh, nothin' feels better than you (La-la, la-la)
Nothin' feels better than you (La-la, la-la)
All those kisses and hugs, wake me up in the mornin'
Forevеr, I'm yours, just know that I'm all in
'Cause nothin' feels better than you, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
