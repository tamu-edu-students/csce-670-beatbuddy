8 ContributorsHeartstrings Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been a while
Oh, darlin', it's been a while
And nothing's changed
And nothing's changed
We're down the line
The same old feelings, down the line
And nothing's changed
And nothing's changed

[Verse 2]
And I still feel you over my skin
Now I need you again
Feel it in my blood
Nothing's changed
Yeah, nothing's changed
And I still feel you over my skin
Now I need you again
Feel it in my blood
Nothing's changed
No, never change

[Chorus]
Oh, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my heartstrings
Yeah, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my—
Oh, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my heartstrings
Yeah, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my—

And the same old feelings down the line
Thеy still run deep
Stay here with me

[Chorus]
Oh, you keep playin' on my hеart
Keep playin' on my heartstrings
Yeah, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my—
Oh, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my heartstrings
Yeah, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my—

I just want you to
I just want you to stay
I just want you to
I just want you to stay
I just want you to
Never changeEmbed
