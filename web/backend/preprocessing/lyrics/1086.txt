40 ContributorsWhat Once Was Lyrics[Verse 1]
I guess I knew this would happen to you
Inside I did, but I refused to know the truth
I'm headin' back inside to sit at home with you
I think I know what's wrong
My friends put on their bravest face
Their tails between their legs, something's out of place
I bet their mothers let them know what I'm about to face
Keep your mouth zipped, son

[Chorus]
Baby, I've been there before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hangin' on
I was at the end of every tether waitin' for what once was

[Verse 2]
Tell me all the important stuff
What's your favorite color, what makes you so tough?
Please don't let go when you've had enough
I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Baby, I've been there before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hangin' on
I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was

Baby, I've been there before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hangin' on
I was at the end of every tether waitin' for what once was

[Outro]
Waitin' for my love
