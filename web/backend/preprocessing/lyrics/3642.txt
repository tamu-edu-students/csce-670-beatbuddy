There's a shadow just behind me
Shrouding every step I take
Making every promise empty
Pointing every finger at me
Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the finger rests
Murder now the pattern, must we
Just because the son has come
[Pre-Chorus]
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past and done?
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past and done?

[Chorus]
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
Why can't we drink forever?
I just want to start this over

[Verse 2]
I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down

Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past and done?
Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past and done?

[Chorus]
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over

[Bridge]
I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
Trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me

[Chorus]
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start things over
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over
[Outro]
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want81Embed Sober Undertow TOOL metal
