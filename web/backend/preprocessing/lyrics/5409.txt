43 ContributorsRip X Lyrics[Intro: Mishaal]
I'll be the stitches to your scars babe
Just hold me, just hold me
I'll be the stitches to your scars babe
Just hold me, just hold me

[Chorus: iamjakehill]
Part of me just wishes I could be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition, man, no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to God that I'll change it
Give me a chance to win your love and I'll take it
Part of me just wishes I could be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition, man, no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to God that I'll change it
Give me a chance to win your love and I'll take it

[Verse: iamjakehill]
I'm better now, riding round top down
Made some mistakes but I'm back up now
Back up now, shut me down
That's okay, it's old news now
Just watch me drown, you love to see that shit
Finger out, while I'm sinking in
Digging deeper, secret keeper
Evil speaker, 'til I meet the reaper
Draw my frown with a permanent pen
Search for peace, I'll find it again
I'm blinded again by violent words
Oh God, it hurts, but still I stand
I'm still one man with my own chains
Can't seem to break what I've made
Everybody loves you when you pass away
Now ask away if you think I'm okay, no

Yeah I know how it feels to be alone
I know how it feels to be around people and feel alone like
I'll be around other people and I'll like, still feel alone
Like even sometimes, I'll go out with my old friends- my previous friends, and I'll just feel alone
And y'know I'm in a position now where I was friends with a lot of people
And then I kinda felt abandoned
I've seen people choose material items over me
I've seen people choose...

[Chorus: iamjakehill]
Part of me just wishes I could be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition, man, no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to God that I'll change it
Give me a chance to win your love and I'll take it
Part of me just wishes I could be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition, man, no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to God that I'll change it
Give me a chance to win your love and I'll take it26Embed
