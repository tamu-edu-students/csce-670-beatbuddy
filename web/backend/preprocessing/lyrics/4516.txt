34 ContributorsNot Gonna Die Lyrics[Verse 1: John Cooper]
Death surrounds
My heartbeat’s slowing down
I won’t take this world’s abuse
I won’t give up, I refuse
This is how it feels when you’re bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity’s stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]
The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

[Verse 2: John Cooper]
Break their hold
Because I won’t be controlled
They can’t keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me I push harder
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

[Bridge: John Cooper]
Don’t you give up on me
You’re everything I need
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you fight back

[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
