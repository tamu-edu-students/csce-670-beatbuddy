25 ContributorsLive and Let Die Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
When you were young, and your heart was an open book
You used to say, "Live and let live"
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say, "Live and let die"
Live and let die

[Post-Chorus Solo]

[Verse]
What does it matter to ya?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to say, "Live and let live"
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
You might also like[Chorus]
Say, "Live and let die"
Live and let die
