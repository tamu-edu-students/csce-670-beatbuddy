I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight
You might also like[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, and the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]

Just might get some sleep tonight7Embed Friend of the Devil American Beauty Grateful Dead psych-rock
