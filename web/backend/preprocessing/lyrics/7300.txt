40 ContributorsThe Crystal Ship Lyrics[Verse 1]
Before you slip into unconsciousness
I'd like to have another kiss
Another flashing chance at bliss
Another kiss, another kiss

[Verse 2]
The days are bright and filled with pain
Enclose me in your gentle rain
The time you ran was too insane
We'll meet again, we'll meet again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, tell me where your freedom lies
The streets are fields that never die
Deliver me from reasons why
You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly

[Verse 4]
The crystal ship is being filled
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills
A million ways to spend your time
When we get back, I'll drop a lineYou might also like28Embed The Crystal Ship The Doors The Doors psych-rock
