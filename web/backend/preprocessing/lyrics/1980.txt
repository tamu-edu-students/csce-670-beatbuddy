Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

[Refrain]
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck

[Verse 2]
They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along

[Bridge]
These days when I'm on the brink of the edge
I remember the words that you said
Remember the life you led
You'd say, "Oh, suck it all up, don't get stuck in the mud
Thinking of things that you should have done"
I'll see you again, my loved one
I'll see you again, my loved one
Yeah, I'm a wreck
I'll see you again, my loved one
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a wreck without you here
(I'm a wreck without you here, loved one)
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
(I'm a wreck since you've been gone)
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along (I'm a wreck)
Yeah, I'm a wreck

[Outro]
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away (But I can't)
One more rainy day without you (One more rainy day)
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day (But I can't)
One more rainy day22Embed Wrecked Mercury - Acts 1 & 2 Imagine Dragons rock
