3 Contributors​boyfriend material Lyrics[Intro]
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Mm-hm-hmm, hm-hm-hmm
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm not the type to be noticed
'Cause I'm barely 5'7
I'm okay good looking
But lacking on fashion
I'm 20 and clueless
'Bout most things romantic
Facing the pressures of dying alone
I hate being single for this long

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not the type, I'm not the type to steal yo girl
I'm not the one, I'm not the one to speak up first
I find it hard to put someone before my work
And I'm too shy so I'm struggling to flirt

[Chorus]
Guess I'm just not boyfriend material
I think I need some loving tutorials
Can't seem to say "I love you", three syllables
'Cause I don’t mean it when I say it
Guess I'm just not boyfriend material
I'm dying for some boyfriend tutorials
Don't fit into that modern criteria
So I'm not what these girls want
You might also like[Verse 2]
I think I'm better off being myself, I know, yeah
It's coloured crew necks for the moment till I don't, yeah
I keep on running out of swipes, so tinder gold, yeah
'Cause sticking to real life is too damn slow

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been looking inside out but still no luck luck (No luck)
These small talk conversations got me giving up (Give up)
Sorry I don't really give a single fuck
Just need a girl that sees the world different and that's enough

[Chorus]
Guess I'm just not boyfriend material
I think I need some loving tutorials
Can't seem to say "I love you" three syllables
'Cause I don't mean it when I say it
Guess I'm just not boyfriend material (Material)
I'm dying for some boyfriend tutorials (Tutorial)
Don't fit into that modern criteria
So I'm not what these girls want

[Outro]
Guess I'm just not boyfriend material
I think I need some loving tutorials
Can't seem to say "I love you" three syllables
'Cause I wanna to mean it when I say it
Yeah, yeahEmbed
