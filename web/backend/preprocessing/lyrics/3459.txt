And during the few moments that we have left
We wanna talk right down to earth
In a language that everybody here can easily understand
[Verse 1]
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
The cult of personality
I know your anger, I know your dreams
I've been everything you wanna be
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
Like Mussolini and Kennedy
I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality
The cult of personality

[Refrain]
Neon lights, Nobel Prize
When a mirror speaks, the reflection lies
You won't have to follow me
Only you can set me free

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I sell the things you need to be
I'm the smiling face of your TV
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
I exploit you, still you love me
I tell you one and one makes three
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
Like Joseph Stalin and Gandhi
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality
The cult of personality

Neon lights, Nobel Prize
When a leader speaks, that leader dies
He won't have to follow me
Only you can set you free

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You gave me fortune, you gave me fame
You gave me power in your God's name
I'm every person you need to be
Oh, I'm the cult
Of person-ality
I am the cult of, I am the cult of
I am the cult of, I am the cult of
I am the cult of, I am the cult of
I am the cult of, I am the cult of
Personality

[Outro: John F. Kennedy & Franklin D. Roosevelt]
Ask not what your country can do for you
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself28Embed
