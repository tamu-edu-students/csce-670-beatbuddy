Everyday I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you've become obsessed
I got to get this message to the press
That everyday I love you less and less
And everyday I love you less and less
I've got to get this feeling off my chest
The doctor says all I need is pills and rest
Since everyday I love you less and less

[Pre-Chorus]
Unless, unless, I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm sick, I'm tired of staying in control
Oh yes, I feel, a rat upon a wheel
I got to know what's not and what is real
Oh yes, I'm stressed, I'm sorry I digress
Impressed, you dressed to S.O.S

[Chorus]
Ooh, and my parents love me (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Ooh, and my girlfriend loves me, ooh (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

[Verse 2]
Everyday I love you less and less
I can't believe once you and me did sex
It makes me sick to think of you undressed
Since everyday I love you less and less
And everyday I love you less and less
You're turning into something I detest
And everybody says that you're a mess
Since everyday I love you less and less

[Chorus]
Ooh, and my parents love me (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Ooh, and my girlfriend loves me (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Ooh, they keep photos of me (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Ooh, that's enough love for me, ooh (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
