All of my friends are settling down
They're only kids but they're married now
Let's follow the lights
Follow the crowd
Baby, we gotta get out
Let's get outta this town

[Verse 1]
I want an ocean view, somewhere
As long as I'm next to you, I don't care
I don't wanna live my life in circles
I just wanna find an empty road
Let's get away from here, let's go

[Chorus]
All of my friends are settling down
They're only kids but they're married now
Let's follow the lights
Follow the crowd
Baby, we gotta get out
Let's get outta this town
(Nothing ever changes)
(Let's get outta this town)

[Verse 2]
Nothing ever changes here, I know
Another day, another year, same old
I don't wanna live my life in circles
I just wanna find an empty road
Let's get away from here, let's go

All of my friends are settling down

Follow the crowd
Baby we gotta get out
Let's get outta this town

[Outro]
Let's get outta this town
Let's get outta this town
Let's get outta this town
Let's get outta this town
Let's get outta this town
Let's get outta this town14Embed
