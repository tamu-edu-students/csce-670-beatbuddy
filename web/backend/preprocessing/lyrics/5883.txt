She's a girl dressed in black from another world
Lives and breathes like a girl from another world
She don't know my name (She don't know my name)
She don't have the time of day
Celebrate, medicate 'til we numb the pain
In the sun‚ it's still dark‚ like it always rains
She don't feel the same (She don't feel the same)
She don't have the time of day

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And I wait‚ and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait‚ and I wait
And I wait for her
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait‚ and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you

She's a girl, I look back to what could have been
Her cloak and dagger, mouth tastes like medicine
She won't last the night (She won't last the night)
Spun out in the neon light
You would leave, but you need me to numb the pain
You're possessed and you slept through another day
You don't feel the same
And I don't have the strength to stay

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
[Bridge: Matt Skiba]
(Oh) I'm goin' to the darkside with you
(Oh) I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you

[Outro: Matt Skiba]
(Oh) I'm goin' to the darkside with you
(Oh) I'm goin' to the darkside with you5Embed
