My double vision
Is only amplifyin' everythin' he isn't
'Til I feel less attached and bored to death, but listen
It's no one's fault, it's just my terrible condition, mm
And I've been thinkin'
If I move out this year, I'll feel my parents slippin'
Away and also, I'm just scared of that commitment
I really think sometimes there's somethin' that I'm missin', mm

[Chorus]
Oh, I know
Spiralin' is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
And oh, I hope
I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult

[Verse 2]
To name this feelin'
Would take a hundred thousand years, some kind of grievin'
But over what I never had, so I've been speakin'
To my therapist, I call her every weekend, mm
I meant to tell you
How I've hated how we left things when it fell through
'Cause you were everythin' to me, where did you run to?
Was it somethin' that I said that colored you blue? Mm

Oh, I know
Spiralin' is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
And oh, I hope
I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult

[Post-Chorus]
Difficult (I)
Difficult

[Bridge]
I've been drinkin'
And stayin' up too late, relivin' bad decisions
I thought eventually, my ranting here would fix it
I really think sometimes there's somethin' that I'm missin' (Mm)

[Chorus]
Oh, I know
Spiralin' is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
And oh, I hope
I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult
Oh, I know
Spiralin' is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
And oh, I hope
I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult8Embed Difficult Difficult Gracie Abrams indie
