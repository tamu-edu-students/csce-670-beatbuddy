4 ContributorsBefore I Wake Lyrics[Verse]
Tonight, it's like a lucid dream
Wanna run, wanna fly, I'ma do everything

[Chorus]
All my desires lifting me higher
Pull me under, into the fire
In this moment, I need to escape
Before I wake and face my fate

[Build]
Here we go

[Drop]
In this moment, I need to escape
Before I wake and face my fate
Face my fate
Face my fate

[Chorus]
All my desires lifting me higher
Pull me under, into the firе
In this moment, I need to escape
Bеfore I wake—
Face my fate, here we go

(Face my fate, face my fate, face my fate)
In this moment, I need to escape
Before I wake and face my fate
