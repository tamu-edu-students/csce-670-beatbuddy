I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
For the mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?

[Verse]
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, no, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you'd have thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Well, broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave, I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, no, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you'd have thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Well, broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave, I'll rot

[Chorus]
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I'll rot

In my grave, I'll rot
I'll rot, I'll rot, I'll rot
Is my pain your freedom?
Is all of my pain your freedom?
