34 ContributorsLose Somebody Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's a classic me mistake
Someone gives me love, and I throw it all away
Tell me, have I gone insane?
Talkin' to myself, but I don't know what to say

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you let go
And now I'm holdin' on
I guess you don't know what you got
Until it's gone

[Chorus]
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh, and I do, and I do, and I do, yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh, yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody

[Verse 2]
So don't tell me it's too late
Hearts are made to bend
Baby, please don't let me break, yeah
I knew I should've stayed
'Cause now, you're movin' on
And I don't know what to say
