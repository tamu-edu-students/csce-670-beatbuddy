26 ContributorsSkin & Bones Lyrics[Verse 1]
You don't know the pain that I feel
Wasting time on love that wasn't real
See me alone, I'm just skin and bones now
I think I'm turning into ash
You call my phone but I'm never home now
You couldn't save me from myself
Lies, they left me with a broken heart
Wounds leave scars when they're always torn apart
So write me a eulogy, all you can do for me
This is the story of my life
So let me lay here, there's nothing to save here
'Cause I'm already dead

[Chorus]
Baby, I just think that you
Need someone to be true to you
I know how to heal your heart
Let me spend some time with you
And maybe change your point of view
You could have a brand new start

[Verse 2]
I know that you feel so damn alone
Some things you can't heal on your own
When you're scared to try, you miss out on life
But darlin', now I'll show you the way
It's not your fault, so, baby, don't cry
Don't be afraid 'cause I'm not him
You're so beautiful, it brings me to my knees
Your eyes are hazel green, shade of autumn leaves
I don't look at you, I look into you
I'm lost in a moment when you're with me
I'll give you trust to build up this love
'Cause honey, I know what we could be
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby, I just think that you
Need someone to be true to you
I know how to heal your heart
Let me spend some time with you
And maybe change your point of view
You could have a brand new start8Embed
