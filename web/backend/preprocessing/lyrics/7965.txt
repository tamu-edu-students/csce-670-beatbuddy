The timing is right to exact my revenge
Spilling enemy blood, I will fight to the end
No more lying-in wait, just to even the score
There's a price to be paid, now it's time for war

[Verse 2]
I'm a soldier of fortune, of torture, and pain
I bash in your skull until no teeth remain
A 'most-deadly' weapon pulverizing your head
With each crushing blow, how you wish you were dead

[Chorus]
Just when you think it's safe, I attack (We'll be back)
When you least expect your fate, I attack (We'll be back)
A kick to your face, one move, big mistake (We'll be back)
Let down your guard, full-on frontal attack
I'll be back

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
No use screaming for mercy, no use making a sound
Still, you step right up and get smacked back down
In the heat of battle, blood congeals on the floor
Another life force bleeds out, another soul out the door

[Verse 4]
Antisocial, sadistic, the "Deity of War"
I stuff body bags, and I'm packing the morgue
No time for remorse over unclaimed remains
It's just flotsam and jetsam, and it's circling the drain

[Chorus]
Just when you think it's safe, I attack (We'll be back)
When you least expect your fate, I attack (We'll be back)
A kick to your face, one move, big mistake (We'll be back)
Let down your guard, full-on frontal attack
I'll be back
