6 ContributorsLike We Used To Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can feel her breath as she's sleepin' next to me
Sharing pillows and cold feet
She can feel my heart, fell asleep to its beat
Under blankets and warm sheets

[Pre-Chorus]
If only I could be in that bed again
If only it were me instead of him

[Chorus]
Does he watch your favorite movies?
Does he hold you when you cry?
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts when you've seen it a million times?
Does he sing to all your music while you dance to "Purple Rain"?
Does he do all these things, like I used to?

[Verse 2]
Fourteen months and seven days ago
Oh, I know you know
How we felt about that night
Just your skin against the window
Oh, we took it slow
And we both know

[Pre-Chorus]
It should have been me inside that car
It should have been me instead of him in the dark
You might also like[Chorus]
Does he watch your favorite movies?
Does he hold you when you cry?
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts when you've seen it a million times?
Does he sing to all your music while you dance to "Purple Rain"?
Does he do all these things, like I used to?

[Bridge]
I know, love, (I'm a sucker for that feeling)
Happens all the time, love, (I always end up feelin' cheated)
You're on my mind, love, (or so that matter when I need it)
It happens all the time- love, yeah

[Chorus]
Will he love you like I loved you?
Will he tell you everyday?
Will he make you feel like you're invincible with every word he'll say?
Can you promise me if this one's right
Don't throw it all away
Can you do all these things?
Will you do all these things like we used to?
Oh, like we used to4Embed
