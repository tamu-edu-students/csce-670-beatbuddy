[Verse 1]
There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong
Lord have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Somethings goin' on here
I have a bad, bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more
(That's alright I still got my guitar, look out now!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well I might as well go on over yonder
Way back up on the hill
(I got something to do)
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will!You might also like1Embed Red House Are You Experienced Jimi Hendrix psych-rock
