A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactionin' me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me, baby

[Verse 1]
Baby, close your eyes and listen to the music
And dig to the summer breeze
It's a groovy night and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease

[Chorus]
Hey, a little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactionin' me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me (Satisfy me)
Satisfy me, baby (Satisfy me)

[Verse 2]
Come on baby, I'm tired of talking
Grab your coat and let's start walking
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Don't procrastinate, don't articulate
Girl it's getting late, and you just sit and wait around

A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me (Satisfy me)
Satisfy me baby (Satisfy me)
Satisfy me girl (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Satisfy me baby (Satisfy me)
Satisfy me (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Satisfy me baby (Satisfy me)
Satisfy me girl (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Satisfy me (Satisfy me)
Satisfy me baby (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Satisfy me (Satisfy me)3Embed A Little Less Conversation The Essential Elvis Presley Elvis Presley rockabilly
