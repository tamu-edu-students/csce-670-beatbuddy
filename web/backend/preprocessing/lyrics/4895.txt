I was only walking through your neighbourhood
Saw your light on, honey, in the cold I stood
Anywhere I go, there you are
Anywhere I go, there you are
I've been getting used to waking up with you
I've been getting used to waking up here
Anywhere I go, there you are
Anywhere I go, there you are
There you are, there you are, mm

[Chorus]
You're the fire and the flood
And I always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your head's resting next to mine, next to mine
You're the fire and the flood
Ah-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah-ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Since we met, I feel a lightness in my step
You're miles away, but I still feel you
Anywhere I go, there you are (Anywhere)
Anywhere I go, there you are
Late at night, when you can't fall asleep
I'll be lying right beside you, counting sheep
Anywhere I go, there you are (Anywhere)
Anywhere I go, there you are
There you are, there you are, mm
