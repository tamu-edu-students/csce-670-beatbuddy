Wasn't raised religious
But I wish that I was
Having nothing to believe in
Has been killing my buzz

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I cut my hair, closed the blinds
Play "Hallelujah" like two dozen times
And yesterday, I tried to pray
But I didn’t know what to say

[Chorus]
I'm too sad to cry, too high to get up
Don't even try ’cause I'm scared to fuck up
Don't like to talk, I just lay in my bed
Don't even try to go out with my friends
Lied to my doctor, she knew I was fakin'
Gave me some pills, but I'm too scared to take 'em
I try and I try, but I'm too sad to cry

[Verse 2]
Can’t tell my mama
It makes her worry
I’m not suicidal
But sometimes, the lines get all blurry

Yeah, I cut my hair, closed the blinds
Played "Hallelujah" like two dozen times
And yesterday, I tried to pray
But I didn't know what to say

[Chorus]
I’m too sad to cry, too high to get up
Don't even try 'cause I'm scared to fuck up
Don’t like to talk, I just lay in my bed
Don't even try to go out with my friends
I lied to my doctor, she knew I was fakin'
Gave me some pills, but I'm too scared to take 'em
I try and I try, but I'm too sad to cry

[Chorus]
I'm too sad to cry, too high to get up
Don't even try 'cause I'm scared to fuck up
Don't like to talk, I just stay in my bed
Don't even try to go out with my friends
Lied to my doctor, she knew I was fakin'
Gave me some pills, but I'm too scared to take 'em
I try and I try, but I'm too sad to cry14Embed
