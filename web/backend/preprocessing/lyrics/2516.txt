36 ContributorsRight Now (Na Na Na) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been so long (Long)
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna be strong (Strong)
But the strength I have is washin' away
It won't be long (Long)
Before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind

[Chorus]
I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know (Know)
Mistakes were made between us two
And we showed (Showed)
Our ass that night, even said some things weren't true
Watched you go (Go)
And haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was?
'Cause you were my homie, lover and friend
