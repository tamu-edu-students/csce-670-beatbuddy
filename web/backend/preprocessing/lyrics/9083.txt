6 ContributorsMy Friend LyricsWhenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
A helping hand you lend in my time of need
Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
(I call on you my friend, I call on you my friend) Listen
Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
A helping hand you lend in my time of need
Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
(I call on you my friend, I call on you my friend)

Whenever I'm down and all that's going on
Is really going on just one of those days (and ju-h..)
You say the right things to keep me moving on
To keep me going strong (going strong, going strong)
Whenever I'm down ain't nobody (body), ain't nobody (body)

Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
A helping hand you lend in my time of need
Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
(I call on you my friend, I call on you my friend)

Whenever I'm down and all that's going on
Is really going on just one of those days (and ju-h..)
You say the right things to keep me moving on
To keep me going strong (going strong, going strong)

Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
A helping hand you lend in my time of need
Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
(I call on you my friend, I call on you my friend)
