I've been painting every fence I know
Every color bleeds into the same
Cause before you go and walk away
Yeah, you better know where you're going
[Chorus]
Hey yeah, hey yeah
You're a wanderer just like me
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Yeah, you better know where you're going
Yeah, you better know where you're going

[Verse 2]
I've been painting every fence I know
Every color bleeds into the same
Cause before you go and walk away
Yeah, you better know where you're going

[Chorus]
Hey yeah, hey yeah
You're a wanderer just like me
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Yeah, you better know where you're going
You're a wanderer just like me
Yeah, you better know where you're going
Hey yeah, hey yeah
You're a wanderer just like me
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Yeah, you better know where you're going
Yeah, you better know where you're going
Yeah, you better know where you're going
You're a wanderer just like me
