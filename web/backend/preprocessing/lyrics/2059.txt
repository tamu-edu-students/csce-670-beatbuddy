[Verse 1: j-hope, SUGA]
Yeah, 누가 내 수저 더럽대
I don't care, 마이크 잡음 금수저 여럿 패
버럭해 잘 못 익은 것들 스테끼 여러 개
거듭해서 씹어줄게 스타의 저녁에
World business (Bang, bang) 핵심
섭외 1순위 (Clap, clap) 매진
많지 않지 이 class 가칠 만끽
좋은 향기에 악췬 반칙
(I go) Mic, mic bungee
Mic, mic bungee, bright light 전진
망할 거 같았겠지만, I'm fine, sorry
미안해 Billboard, 미안해 worldwide
아들이 넘 잘나가서 미안해 엄마
대신해줘 니가 못한 효도
우리 콘서트 절대 없어 포도
I do it, I do it, 넌 맛없는 라따뚜이
혹 배가 아프다면 고소해, sue it

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jung Kook, Jimin, Jin]
Did you see my bag? (Where?) Did you see my bag? (Where?)
It's hella trophies and it's hella thick (Hella thick, hella thick)
What you think 'bout that? (Well) What you think 'bout that? (Well)
I bet it got my haters hella sick (Hella sick)
Come and follow me, follow me with your signs up
I'm so firin', firin', boy, your time's up
Keep on runnin' and runnin' until I catch up
How you dare? How you dare? How you dare?

Another trophy, my hands carry 'em
Too many that I can't even count 'em (Turn it up now)
Mic drop, mic drop
발발 조심 너네 말말 조심
Somebody stop me, I'm 'boutta pop off
Too busy, you know my body ain't enough (Turn it up now)
Mic drop, mic drop
*발발 조심 너네 말말 조심*

[Instrumental Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2: RM]
Baby, watch your mouth (Mouth)
It come back around ('Round)
Once upon a time (Time)
We learnt how to fly (Fly)
Go look at your mirror, same damn clothes (Yeah)
You know how I feel, 개행복 (Turn up)
How many hours do we fly? (Ooh)
I keep on dreamin' on the cloud
Yeah, I'm on the mountain, yeah, I'm on the bay (Pop)
Everyday we vibin', mic drop, bam

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook, V, Jimin, Jin]
Did you see my bag? (Where?) Did you see my bag? (Where?)
It's hella trophies and it's hella thick (Hella thick, hella thick)

[Instrumental Post-Chorus]

[Interlude: RM]
Haters gon' hate
Players gon' play
Live a life, man
Good luck

[Bridge: Jin, V, Jung Kook, Jimin]
더 볼 일 없어 마지막 인사야
할 말도 없어 사과도 하지 마
더 볼 일 없어 마지막 인사야
할 말도 없어 사과도 하지 마
잘 봐 넌 그 꼴 나지
우린 탁 쏴 마치 콜라지
너의 각막 깜짝 놀라지
꽤 꽤 폼나지 포 포 폼나지
