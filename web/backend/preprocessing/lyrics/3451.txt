You'll never take us alive
We swore that death will do us part
They'll call our crimes a work of art
You'll never take us alive
We'll live like spoiled royalty, lovers and partners
Partners in crime
Partners in crime

[Verse 1]
This, the tale of, reckless love, living a life of crime on the run
A brush to a gun, to paint these states, green and red
Everybody freeze, nobody move
Put the money in the bag, or we will shoot
Empty out the vault and me and my doll will be on our way

[Pre-Chorus]
Our paper faces flood the streets
And if the heat comes close enough to burn
Then we'll play with fire, 'cause

[Chorus]
You'll never take us alive
We swore that death will do us part
They'll call our crimes a work of art
You'll never take us alive
We'll live like spoiled royalty, lovers and partners
Partners in crime
Partners in crime

[Verse 2]
Here we find our omnipotent outlaws fall behind the grind tonight
Left unaware that the lone store owner won't go down without a fight

Where we gonna go, he's got us pinned
Baby I'm a little scared
Now, don't you quit
He's sounded the alarm, I hear the sirens closing in

[Pre-Chorus]
Our paper faces flood the streets
And if the heat comes close enough to burn
Then we're burning this place to the ground, 'cause

[Chorus]
You'll never take us alive
We swore that death will do us part
They'll call our crimes a work of art
You'll never take us alive
We'll live like spoiled royalty, lovers and partners
Partners in crime
Partners in crime

Police department:
We're the Placerville Sheriff's Police Department
Come out with your hands up!
We have the place surrounded
Put your weapons down, put your weapons down!
Ready men? Aim. Fire!
[Bridge]
The skies are black with lead-filled rain
A morbid painting on display
This is the night the young love died
Buried at each other's side

[Modified Chorus]
You never took us alive
We swore that death would do us part
So now we haunt you in the dark
You never took us alive
We live as ghosts among these streets
Lovers and partners
Partners in crime
