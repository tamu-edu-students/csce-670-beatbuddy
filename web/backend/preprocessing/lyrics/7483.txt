38 ContributorsWhat Ever Happened? Lyrics[Chorus]
I wanna be forgotten
And I don't wanna be reminded
You say, "Please don't make this harder"
No, I won't yet
I wanna be beside her
She wanna be admired
You say, "Please don't make this harder"
No, I won't yet

[Verse 1]
Oh, dear, is it really all true?
Did they offend us and they want it to sound new?
Top ten ideas for countdown shows
Whose culture is this and does anybody know?
I wait and tell myself, "life ain't chess"
But no one comes in and yes, you're alone
You don't miss me, I know

[Verse 2]
Oh, Tennessee, what did you write?
I come together in the middle of the night
Oh, that's an ending that I can't write
'Cause I've got you to let me down

[Chorus]
I wanna be forgotten
And I don't want to be reminded
You say, "Please don't make this harder"
No, I won't yet
I wanna be beside her
She wanna be admired
I said, "Please don't make this harder"
No, I won't yetYou might also like13Embed
