Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out
Or looked down on
Just try your best, try everything you can
And don't you worry what they tell themselves
When you're away

[Chorus]
It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

[Verse 2]
Hey, you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own (On your own)
So don't buy in
Live right now, yeah, just be yourself
It doesn't matter if it's good enough (Good enough)
For someone else

[Chorus]
It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright
It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright
Woo!

Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out (Feel left out)
Or looked down on
Just do your best (Just do your best)
Do everything you can (Do everything you can)
And don't you worry what their bitter hearts (Bitter hearts)
Are gonna say

[Chorus]
It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright
It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright34Embed The Middle Bleed American Jimmy Eat World emo
