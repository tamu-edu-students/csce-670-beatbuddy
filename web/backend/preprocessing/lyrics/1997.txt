Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain, spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard, catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, and to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do

[Verse 2]
Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

[Chorus]
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
Every single memory of the good or bad
Faces of luck, don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But to be yourself is all that you can do, yeah
To be yourself is all that you can do, oh

[Chorus]
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh-yeah
To be yourself is all that you can—
Be yourself is all that you can—
Be yourself is all that you can do22Embed
