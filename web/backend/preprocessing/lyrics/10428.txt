[Verse 1]
Girl, don't keep no secrets from me
When you lock up, I hold the key
You already know, girl, what it was, yeah, uh
You wanna stay high in the sheets
And say I'm playing Monopoly
Or tell me 'bout myself so I can justify why

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gon' keep on coming back to you, huh
Just hit me when you're lonely and I'll come over
Don't be actin' hella shady
Like I didn't fuck you just the other night

[Chorus]
But that's alright, but that's alright, yeah
Show me something different, you ain't gotta lie
But that's alright, but that's alright, yeah
Lil' mama, show me something different (Show me something different)
It's alright, I'll please you right
Show me something different, you ain't gotta lie
But that's alright, I'll please you right, girl

You make me feel helpless
Obviously I don't wanna give you pain
I know it's selfish
Too proud to say I don't want anything

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gon' keep on coming back to you
Just hit me when you're lonely and I'll come over (I'll come over)
Don't be actin' hella shady
Like I didn't fuck you just the other night

[Chorus]
But that's alright, but that's alright, yeah
Show me something different, you ain't gotta lie
But that's alright, but that's alright, yeah
Lil' mama, show me something different (Show me something different)
Show me something different, you ain't gotta lie
But that's alright, but that's alright, yeah

[Outro]
I'm gon' keep coming back to you, you, you, youEmbed
