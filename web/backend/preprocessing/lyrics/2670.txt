Like walkin' into a dream
So unlike what you've seen
So unsure, but it seems
'Cause we've been waitin' for you
Fallen into this place
Just givin' you a small taste
Of your afterlife here, so stay
You'll be back here soon anyway
I see a distant light
But girl, this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see
So how did this come to be?
Arrived too early

[Pre-Chorus: M. Shadows]
And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life, and realize this is going too far

[Chorus: M. Shadows]
I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here

Place of hope and no pain
Perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place, but refrain
'Cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place
Just givin' you a small taste
Of your afterlife here, so stay
You'll be back here soon anyway
This peace on Earth's not right
(Up with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time
(I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place, don't wanna stay
I feel wrong, and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

[Pre-Chorus: M. Shadows]
Gave me your hand, but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand, I have to leave and carry on my own life

[Chorus: M. Shadows]
I don't belong here, I gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you, and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside
When the time is right
[Bridge: M. Shadows & The Rev]
Loved ones back home all cryin' 'cause they're already missin' me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken, I'm chokin' on this ecstasy)
Oh, Lord, I'll try so hard, but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live! Ah!)
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: M. Shadows]
I don't belong here, I gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you, and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside
When the time is right41Embed
