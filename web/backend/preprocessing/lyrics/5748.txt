44 ContributorsRoads Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say

[Chorus]
How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?

[Verse 2]
Storm in the morning light
I feel, no more can I say
Frozen to myself
I got nobody on my side
And surely that ain't right
Surely that ain't right

[Verse 1]
Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say
You might also like[Chorus]
How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?

[Chorus]
How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?

[Verse 1]
Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say

[Chorus]
How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?16Embed Roads Dummy Portishead electronic
