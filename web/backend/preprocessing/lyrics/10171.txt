Blowing up my phone, you know I'll never pick up

[Verse 1]
Blowing up my phone, you know I'll never pick up
I'm on my own, I'm smoking dope, I got some liq' in my cup
Can't break my heart, it's made of chrome, I'm just too in my zone
I tried to warn her ass before, but she ain't leave me alone
I'm in a C63 going 125
Then I open my eyes, I can't believe I'm alive still
Know you saved my life, but we both gonna die still
Don't see where I'm going 'cause I'm rolling on five pills

[Chorus]
Take a walk through the belly of the beast
Hit the devil and tell his ass you was talking with me
I keep a pistol in my bed, sitting right on the sheets
I'm on a level where it's somewhere that you ain't never gon' be
Talk to me, gotta watch your tone, bitch
I could cut you off quicker than a fucking lane switch
I could put you on, but you gotta know the basics
I could get you knocked for the price of my bracelet

[Verse 2]
Show me a sign if you hear me
I was really on, now I've grown so weary
I can see your face, but I'm staring at the ceiling
I can feel your touch, but you ain't even near me
I can see better when the lights turn off
I can do better so I wrote this song for you
Black and white leather and I'm smashing on the pedal
Back to back Benzes, now I'm moving presidential
Ice on my neck, should have a price on my head
I've been up a couple days, I'll go to sleep when I'm dead
I got a lot up on my mind while I had so much I said
I got a lot up in this cup, you take one sip and you're dead

Take a walk through the belly of the beast
Hit the devil and tell his ass you was talking with me
I keep a pistol in my bed, sitting right on the sheets
I'm on a level where it's somewhere that you ain't never gon' be
Talk to me, gotta watch your tone, bitch
I could cut you off quicker than a fucking lane switch
I could put you on, but you gotta know the basics
I could get you knocked for the price of my bracelet10Embed
