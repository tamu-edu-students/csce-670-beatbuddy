Never know, never know what I'm feeling
Maybe I, maybe I never committed, I guess
How will I know, will I know when I'm in it
Seven months, all at once, far from beginning, I guess

[Pre-Chorus]
But you got me saying
Ooooooh
Used to wishing there was something more but
I'm not thinking that anymore, yeah
Ooooooh
Used to leaving every other day but
Now I wanna stay

[Chorus]
No one ever got me high like this
Set me on fire like this
Running on a wire like this
Losing my mind like this
I don't know what it is
But I could never call it quits
I just wanna stay like this
I just wanna stay like this
Like this

Out of time, out of time, better get it
Recognize, recognize, prime when you see it
I hope, I hope
Yeah, every time, every time something missing
I should give it up, maybe I just been pretending, I won't
No, I won't

[Chorus]
'Cause no one ever got me high like this
Set me on fire like this
Running on a wire like this
Losing my mind like this
I don't know what it is
But I could never call it quits
I just wanna stay like this
I just wanna stay like this
Like this

[Post-Chorus]
Ooooooh
I just wanna stay like this
I just wanna stay like this, yeah
Ooooooh
I just wanna stay like this
I just wanna stay like this, yeah

[Bridge]
I won't say it lightly
Wonder what we might be
This is so unlike me

I won't say it lightly
Wonder what we might be
This is so unlike me

[Chorus]
'Cause no one ever got me high like this
Set me on fire like this
Running on a wire like this
Losing my mind like this
And I don't know what it is
But I could never call it quits
I just wanna stay like this
I just wanna stay like this
Like this

[Post-Chorus]
Ooooooh
I just wanna stay like this
I just wanna stay like this, yeah
Ooooooh
I just wanna stay like this
I just wanna stay like this, yeahEmbed
