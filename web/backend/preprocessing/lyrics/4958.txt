19 ContributorsCryin’ Like a Bitch!! Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Strut on by like a king
Telling everybody they know nothing
And long-lived what you thought you were
Time ain't on your side anymore, anymore

[Chorus 1]
And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch

[Verse 2]
I'm tougher than nails, I can promise you that
Step outta line, and you'll get bitch-slapped back
And you can run your little mouth all day
But the hand of God just smacked you back into yesterday

[Chorus 2]
And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
And you wonder why no one can stand you
There's no denying you were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch

Blinded by your sacred, faded past times
Only time is your enemy
Granted a second chance
To prove that your arrogance
Is stronger than you'll ever be...
It's stronger than you can be

Oh, stronger than you can be
Oh, stronger than you can
Be

[Outro]
And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
And you wonder why no one can stand you
There's no denyin' you were cryin' like a bitch

You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
Oh, bitch4Embed
