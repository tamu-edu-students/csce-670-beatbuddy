Give me a word, give me a sign
Show me where to look, tell me, what will I find?
What will I find?
Lay me on the ground or fly me in the sky
Show me where to look, tell me, what will I find?
What will I find?

Love is in the water, love is in the air
Show me where to look, tell me, will love be there?
Will love be there?
Teach me how to speak, teach me how to share
Teach me where to go, tell me, will love be there?
Will love be there?
