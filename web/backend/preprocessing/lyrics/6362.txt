50 ContributorsMy Propeller Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you can summon the strength, tow me
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your descent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys

[Chorus]
Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller

[Verse 2]
It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrowed the beak off a bald eagle
Oh, momentary synergy

[Chorus]
Coax me out my low
Sink into tomorrow
Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller

[Outro]
My propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh, my propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh, my propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh, my propellerYou might also like25Embed
