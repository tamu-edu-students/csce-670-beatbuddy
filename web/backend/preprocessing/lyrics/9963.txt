Remember when Hell had frozen over?
The cold still burns underneath my skin
The water is rising all around me
And there is nothing left I can give
All these tears I've shed
I saw the wildfire spread
You said you cheated death
But Heaven was in my head

[Chorus]
They say "the good die young"
No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday

[Post-Chorus]
No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday

[Verse 2]
The embers still glow when I'm sober
The gold in the flame burns brighter now
I have to rebuild, now it's over
Maybe now I'm lost, I can live
Souls don't break, they bend
But I sometimes forget
I have to do this for you
And the only way out is through
Yeah, death is an open door

Words the prophets said
Still swimming through my head
Now there's no stars left in the sky
'Cause this well will never run dry
What if I completely forget?
What if I never accept?
'Cause when you fade away
It's like a brand new doomsday
Yeah

[Chorus]
They say "the good die young"
No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday

[Post-Chorus]
No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday17Embed Doomsday Holy Hell Architects metalcore
