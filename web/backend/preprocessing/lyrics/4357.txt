55 ContributorsPerfect Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just a perfect day, drink Sangria in the park
And then later, when it gets dark, we go home
Just a perfect day, feed animals in the zoo
Then later, a movie too and then home

[Chorus]
Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

[Verse 2]
Just a perfect day, problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own, it's such fun
Just a perfect day, you made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else, someone good

[Chorus]
Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

You're going to reap just what you sow

You're going to reap just what you sow37Embed Perfect Day Transformer Lou Reed psych-rock
