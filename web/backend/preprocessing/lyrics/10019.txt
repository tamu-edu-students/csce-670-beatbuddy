6 ContributorsDon’t Love You No More (I’m Sorry) Lyrics[Verse 1]
For all the years that I've known you baby
I can't figure out the reason why lately
You've been acting so cold (Didn't you say)
If there's a problem we should work it out
So why you giving me the cold shoulder now?
Like you don't want to talk to me girl (Tell me)

Okay I know I was late again (Late again)
I made you mad and dinners thrown in (The bin)
But why you making this thing drag on so long? (I wanna know)
I'm sick and tired of this silly game (Silly game)
Don't think that I'm the only one here to blame
It's not me who's been going round slamming doors

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when you turned and said to me
I don't care babe who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more

[Chorus]
Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, you're gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now it's too late to turn it around

I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just don't love you no more

[Verse 2]
I know that I've made a few mistakes
But never thought things would turn out this way
Doesn't make sense to me now that you're gone (I see it all so clearly)
Me at the door with you in a state (In a state)
Giving my reasons but as you look away
I can see a tear roll down your face

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when you turned and said to me
I don't care babe who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more

[Chorus]
Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, you're gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now it's too late to turn it around

I'm sorry for the tears, I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just don't love you no more


[Bridge]
Those simple words hit so hard
They turned my whole world upside down
Girl you caught me completely off guard
On that night you said to me
I just don't love you no more

[Chorus]
Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, you're gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now it's too late to turn it around

I'm sorry for the tears, I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just don't love you no more1Embed
