74 ContributorsAbout a Girl Lyrics[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue

[Chorus]
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free (I do)

[Verse 2]
(I do) I'm standin' in your line
I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number too
I do keep a date with you

[Chorus]
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free

No, I can't see you every night
