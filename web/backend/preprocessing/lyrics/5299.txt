Sunday morning brings the dawn in
It's just a restless feeling by my side
Early dawning, Sunday morning
It's just the wasted years so close behind
[Chorus]
Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Sunday morning and I'm falling
I've got a feeling I don't want to know
Early dawning, Sunday morning
It's all the streets you crossed not so long ago
[Chorus]
Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all
