Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me

[Verse]
Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me
Even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care, at all
You've been out all night
I don't know where you've been
You're slurring all your words
Not making any sense
But I don't fucking care, at all

[Chorus]
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care

[Drop]
'Cause I'm so fucking scared
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care, at all, oh

Even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care, at all
You've been out all night
I don't know where you've been
You're slurring all your words (Slurring all your words)
Not making any sense
But I don't fucking care, at all

[Chorus]
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
'Cause I'm so fucking scared

[Drop]
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care, at all, oh
