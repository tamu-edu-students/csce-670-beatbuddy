50 ContributorsSquare Hammer Lyrics[Verse 1: Papa Emeritus III]
Living in the night, 'neath devils torn asunder
You call on me to solve a crooked rhyme
As I'm closing in imposing on your slumber
You call on me as bells begin to chime

[Chorus: Papa Emeritus III]
Are you on the square? Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now before the devil?
That you're on the square? That you're on the level?
That you're ready to stand right here, right now? Right here, right now

[Verse 2: Papa Emeritus III]
Hiding from the light, sacrificing nothing
Still, you call on me for entrance to the shrine
Hammering the nails into a sacred coffin
You call on me for powers clandestine

[Chorus: Papa Emeritus III]
Are you on the square? Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now before the devil?
That you're on the square? That you're on the level?
That you're ready to stand right here, right now? Right here, right now

That you're on the square? That you're on the level?
That you're ready to stand right here, right now? Right here, right now

[Outro: Papa Emeritus III]
Right here, right now
Right here, right now
Right here, right now
Right here, right now18Embed Square Hammer Meliora (Deluxe Edition) Ghost hard-rock
