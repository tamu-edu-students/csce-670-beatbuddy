25 ContributorsEverything Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm on my own, broke and alone
I feel the rain crashing down
All around this empty town
I'm searching for the lost and found
But you don't care, you're unaware
Keep moving like the scars aren't even there
It's in the air, like a prism flare
Just stay, 'cause the flames will burn us

[Chorus]
I thought you were the one for me
That's why I gave you everything
Held you close by the stormy seas
Oh, you meant the world to me

[Pre-Drop]
I used to kiss your head when you cried for me
Hold your hand while the pain was all around
Keep you warmed by the roaring sea
Oh, you meant the world to me

[Drop]
Oh, you meant the world to me
Oh, you meant the world to me

My darling dear, you're never here
When I'm in pain you hide and disappear
Like shadows in the atmosphere
Charming the stratosphere, yeah
I prayed for you, and catch you near
In hopes you'd chase away my fears
I'm on my own, you made it so
And now I'm chasing nightmares through your pain

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to run with you through the great big leaves
Laugh at you when you laugh at me
Hope for us because I believed
That home was just you and me

[Chorus]
I thought you were the one for me
That's why I gave you everything
Held you close by the stormy seas
Oh, you meant the world to me

[Drop]
Oh, you meant the world to me
Oh, you meant the world to me
[Bridge]
Oh, I'm gonna do this on my own
No point in blaming you, you did not know, oh

[Chorus]
I thought you were the one for me
That's why I gave you everything
Held you close by the stormy seas
Oh, you meant the world to me

[Drop]
Oh, you meant the world to me
Oh, you meant the world to me

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm gonna do this on my own
No point in blaming you, you did not know, oh
Oh, I'm gonna do this on my own
No point in blaming you, you did not know, oh

[Chorus]
I thought you were the one for me
That's why I gave you everything
Held you close by the stormy seas
Oh, you meant the world to me7Embed Everything Everything Diamond Eyes edm
