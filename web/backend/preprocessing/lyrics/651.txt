Ooh-oh, ooh-woo
Ooh-oh, ooh-woo

[Verse 1]
You say you love me, I say you crazy
We're nothing more than friends
You're not my lover, more like a brother
I known you since we were like ten, yeah

[Refrain]
Don't mess it up, talking that shit
Only gonna push me away, that's it!
When you say you love me, that make me crazy
Here we go again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times

[Chorus]
Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Haven't I made it obvious? (Ooh-oh, ooh-wooh)
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you? (Ooh-oh, ooh-wooh)
