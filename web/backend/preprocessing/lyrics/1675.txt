35 ContributorsHeart of Gold Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1: Neil Young]
I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give

[Chorus: Neil Young]
That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Neil Young]
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

[Chorus: Neil Young]
That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold21Embed
