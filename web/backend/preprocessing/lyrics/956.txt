You show us everything you've got
You keep on dancin', and the room gets hot
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
You say you wanna go for a spin
The party's just begun, we'll let you in
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'

[Chorus]
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day

[Verse 2]
You keep on saying you'll be mine for a while
You're lookin' fancy, and I like your style
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
You show us everything you've got
Baby, baby, that's quite a lot
And you drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'

I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day

I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day8Embed Rock And Roll All Nite Dressed To Kill KISS hard-rock
