I gotta go right now, that's all
Nothing to it, don't expect no call
Y'all been plotting on me, praying I fall
I been working, I been giving my all
I gotta go right now, that's all
Nothing to it, don't expect no call
Y'all been plotting on me, praying I fall
I been working, I been giving my all

[Chorus]
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that it's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that it's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong

[Verse]
One more chance to give and that's all I have
All I have left in my heart
I've been through enough to know
When you're sad and we're far apart

Give me a line so I can write you a line again (Yeah)
Give me some time and I'ma make you mine again (Yeah)
Give me a line so I can write you a line again (Yeah)

[Chorus]
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that it's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that it's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong

[Outro]
One more chance to give and that's all I have, all I have
She was the one with the broken smile
She was the one that was worth my time98Embed Broken Smile (My All) Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2 Lil Peep emo
