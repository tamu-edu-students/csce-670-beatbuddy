Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hopin' they're lookin' for you
Sure you'll be rummagin' through
Oh and the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word, so you're waitin' and waitin' and

[Chorus]
The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Well, don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for, don't you know?

[Verse 2]
The lights are flashin'
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretendin' to dance
Don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same as they all do and hope for the best
You might also like[Chorus]

Well, don't you always do the same?
It's what you’re there for, but no

[Verse 3]
Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hopin' they're lookin' for you
Sure you'll be rummagin' through
And I said, the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride, yeah
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word, so you're waitin' and waitin'12Embed
