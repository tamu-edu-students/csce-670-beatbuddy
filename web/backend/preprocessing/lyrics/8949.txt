3 ContributorsLive on Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
We got something that's something so solid
We got something that's worth more than gold
Anywhere where I got you beside me
Is home

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we got so much
As long as we got us
We got everything that we need
If we didn't have a dime
Somehow we'd still get by
You and I

[Chorus]
We could live on love
We could survive on this feeling, feeling, this feeling
'Cause this love's enough
'Cause this is all we needed, needed, we needed
We could livе on love
We could live on lovе

[Verse 2]
I don't need no fancy walls around me
I'd be fine with being on the street
I'm good being anywhere if you're there
With me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I got it all
Everything I want
'Cause you're everything that I need
If we're down to our last dime
Somehow we'll be just fine
You and I

[Chorus]
We could live on love
We could survive on this feeling, feeling, this feeling
'Cause this love's enough
'Cause this is all we needed, needed, we needed
We could live on love
We could survive on this feeling, feeling, this feeling
'Cause this love's enough
Could live on love
We could live on love
We could live on love
We could survive on this feeling, feeling, this feeling
'Cause this love's enough
'Cause this is all we needed, needed, we needed
We could live on love
We could live on love, love, love
We could live on love
'Cause it's all we needEmbed
