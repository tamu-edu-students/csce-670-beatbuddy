I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought, but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cut the cord

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

[Verse 2]
Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

[Bridge]
Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
[Pre-Chorus 3]
You've got to let me know

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

[Outro]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
Are we human
Or are we dancer?34Embed
