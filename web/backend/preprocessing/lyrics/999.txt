I hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time, but that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all
You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time, you let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hopin' you would let it go and you did

[Chorus]
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

[Verse 2]
I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did

[Chorus]
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
Hey, why do you sing with an English accent?
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you out
You might also like[Bridge]
You said when you met me, you were bored
You said when you met me, you were bored
And you, you were in a band when I was born

[Chorus]
I have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean and live without
And I wanna know what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the sound31Embed
