10 Contributors​i’m a ghost but it hurts Lyrics[Chorus]
Yeah, listen close to my words, yeah
I'm a ghost but it hurts, yeah
I got thrown to the curb, uh
All alone, it's a curse, yeah
Put my soul in a verse, woah
They don’t know how it works, yeah
I've been searching for a new life
See the stepping stones in the dirt? yeah
I want everyone to love me
I want everyone to trust me
Not gonna happen, I think about this every day
And dream about it every night, what am I lacking?
Conversations in the mirror
No one there up in the rearview
Driving alone, got no music playing when I'm steering
Hope you like it when you hear it, yeah

[Verse]
I'm doing this for myself
I'm doing this to survive
I just wanna feel alive
Got some regrets in my head but
I'm pushing them all to the side
I wanna go hard, going so far
Feeling so low, on my solo
Body so cold, going so numb
Like a sore thumb, stick out too much
Definition of a bad decision
Never told me that I had to listen
I was always on a path to glisten
Broke boy with a castle vision
Yeah, now they’re tearing me down
Can't find a crown
Can't make a sound
I couldn't show 'em what I am about

Yeah, listen close to my words, yeah
I'm a ghost but it hurts, yeah
I got thrown to the curb, uh
All alone, it's a curse, yeah
Put my soul in a verse, woah
They don’t know how it works, yeah
I've been searching for a new life
See the stepping stones in the dirt? yeah
I want everyone to love me
I want everyone to trust me
Not gonna happen, I think about this every day
And dream about it every night, what am I lacking?
Conversations in the mirror
No one there up in the rearview
Driving alone, got no music playing when I'm steering
Hope you like it when you hear it, yeah

[Outro]
Listen close to my words, yeah
I'm a ghost but it hurts, yeah
I got thrown to the curb, uh
All alone, it's a curse, yeah
Put my soul in a verse, woah
They don't know how it works, yeah
I've been searching for a new life
See the stepping stones in the dirt?6Embed
