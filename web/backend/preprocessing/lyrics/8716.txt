Seven lonely days and a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run, what you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home

[Verse 2]
So, I'm walking in the rain, thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky backroad
I've loved you much too long, my love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing what went wrong

[Chorus]
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (Rain in my shoes)
Searching for you in the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain

[Verse 3]
Showed your photograph to some old gray-bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said, "Yes, she's been here," but their memory wasn't clear
"Was it yesterday? No, wait, the day before"

[Verse 4]
I finally got a ride with a preacher man who asked
"Where you bound on such a cold, dark afternoon?"
As we drove on thru the rain, as he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you
You might also like[Chorus]
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (Rain in my shoes)
Searching for you in the cold Kentucky rain

[Outro]
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
The cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain1Embed Kentucky Rain From Elvis in Memphis Elvis Presley rockabilly
