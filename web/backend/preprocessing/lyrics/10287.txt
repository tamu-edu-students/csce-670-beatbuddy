7 ContributorsCold Lyrics[Verse 1]
Heal your frays, just to know you'll wear them thin again
Peel off the name, that I gave and I knew you wore within
Forget our nave, the summer spent within

[Chorus]
For all that it's worth now, you were worth it in the end
For all off your worth, I would lapse and fall again
For all that it's worth, I would have loved you until the end
But I'm cold in your heart and you're branded into mine

[Verse 2]
Bruise the hope, our endeavour would ever see the light
Choose your own, I'll face the world knowing that you've grown
And I'll leave your curls and move past alone

[Chorus]
For all that it's worth now, you were worth it in the end
For all off your worth, I would lapse and fall again
For all that it's worth, I would have loved you until the end
But I'm cold in your heart and you're branded into mineSee Novo Amor LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like1Embed
