3 ContributorsDumb Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've seen you like a million times
But never got ask you out
What if you don't feel like I do?
Would I stand here like a fool?
I've never met a girl like you (I've never met a girl like you)
You turn my sky from grey to blue (You turn my sky from grey to blue)
I've always tried to play it cool
But now I stand here like a fool

[Chorus]
Oh, now I'm feeling so dumb
Dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Oh, now you make me feel dumb

[Post-Chorus]
Dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb

[Verse 2]
I'll take you to a rooftop bar (Rooftop bar)
So you can shine among the stars (Among the stars)
I've always tried to play it cool
But now I stand here like a fool
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, now I'm feeling so dumb
Dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Oh, now you make me feel dumb
Oh, now I'm feeling so dumb
Dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Oh, now you make mе feel dumb

[Post-Chorus]
Dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb

[Bridge]
Nike shoes, sailor hat, button lovely, La Boum
I'm rеady to make a move
But the words that I say don't make sense anyway
I just can't get it right
You're so damn fine (Are you stupid or something?)

[Chorus]
Oh, now I'm feeling so dumb
Dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Oh, now you make me feel dumb
Dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumb
Dumb-dumb, di-da, di-da, di, dumbEmbed
