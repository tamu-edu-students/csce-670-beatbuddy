4 ContributorsCraig David - Rise and Fall (ft. Sting) (Traduction Française) Lyrics[Refrain] x2
Sometimes, in life, you feel the fight is over
And it seems as though the writings on the wall
Superstar you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

[Couplet 1]
I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties
I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends, I knew before, they go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same
Cause with the money came a different status
That's when things change
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

[Refrain]
You might also like[Couplet 2]
I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews, no pictures
And list demands
Given advice that was clearly wrong
The type that seems to make me feel so right
But some things you may find can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places
And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away
When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart ?

[Refrain]

[Pont]
Now I know I made mistakes
Think I don't care
But you don't realize what this means to me
So let me have just one more chance
I'm not the man I used to be
Use to be
[Refrain] x3
