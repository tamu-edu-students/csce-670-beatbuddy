My friend's got a girlfriend, man, he hates that bitch
He tells me every day
He says, "Man, I really gotta lose my chick
In the worst kinda way."

[Verse 2]
She sits on her ass, he works his hands to the bone
To give her money every payday
But she wants more dinero just to stay at home
Well, my friend, you gotta say

[Chorus]
"I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"
Say, "No way," say, "No way-ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"

[Verse 3]
I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough
To keep her bill collectors at bay
I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough
’Cause that girl's got expensive taste

[Chorus]
"I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"
Say, "No way," say, "No way-ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"
