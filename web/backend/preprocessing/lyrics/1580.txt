50 ContributorsI Found Lyrics[Verse 1]
And I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense, then you'll lose your mind
And I'll use you as a focal point
So I don’t lose sight of what I want
And I've moved further than I thought I could
But I missed you more than I thought I would
And I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense, then you'll lose your mind

[Chorus]
Oh, and I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me
And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me

[Verse 2]
And I'll use you as a makeshift gauge
Of how much to give and how much to take
Oh, I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense, then you'll lose your mind

[Chorus]
Oh, and I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me
And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, and I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me
And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me53Embed
