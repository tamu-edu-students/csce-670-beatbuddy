12 ContributorsTruly Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, tell me only this
That I have your heart for always
And you want me by your side
Whispering the words "I'll always love you"

[Chorus 1]
And forever, I will be your lover
And I know if you really care
I will always be there

[Verse 2]
Now I need to tell you this
There's no other love like your love
And I, as long as I live
I'll give you all the joy
My heart and soul can give

[Chorus 2]
Let me hold you
I need to have you near me
And I feel with you in my arms
This love will last forever

[Chorus 3]
Because I'm truly
Truly in love with you, girl
I'm truly head over heels with your love
I need you, and with your love, I'm free
And truly, you know you're alright, with meSee Lionel Richie LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also like2Embed Truly Lionel Richie Lionel Richie disco
