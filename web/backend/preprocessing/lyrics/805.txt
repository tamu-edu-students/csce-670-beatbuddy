Climb on board
We'll go slow and high tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together (I)
I love to hold you close tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold you close tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

[Chorus]
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place you lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behaviour
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fuckin' and fightin' on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

Pillow talk
My enemy, my ally
Prisoners
Then we're free, it's a thin line

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together (I)
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

[Chorus]
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place you lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behaviour
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fuckin' and fightin' on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

[Bridge]
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone
[Chorus]
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place you lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behaviour
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw (And raw)
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day (No)
Fuckin' and fightin' on
It's our paradise (Yeah) and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone122Embed PILLOWTALK Mind Of Mine (Deluxe Edition) ZAYN dance
