Where are those happy days? They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

[Chorus]
So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?

[Verse 2]
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood
What happened to our love? It used to be so good

[Chorus]
So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?

So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S
And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?

[Outro]
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?8Embed SOS ABBA Gold ABBA swedish
