Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria
