21 ContributorsMandy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

[Verse 2]
Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me

[Chorus]
Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming

[Chorus]
Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

[Bridge]
Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on a breeze
The pain is calling

[Chorus]
Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy
[Outro]
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you6Embed Mandy Barry Manilow II Barry Manilow disco
