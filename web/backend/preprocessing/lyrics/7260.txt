8 ContributorsWeather Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll drop and speak a charm
Take the weather from your heart
And the weight from on your toes
And there's nothing to your side
For you to recognise
It tarnished long ago

[Verse 2]
The lake will overflow
Flood all I've ever known
Break walls and sever bones
Now I'll hold it in my heart
Just for you to fall apart
Stunt all we'd ever grown

[Chorus]
Burn the bed and the dreams I've never met
Those wishes were never for granted
So burn the bed I'll face the wind and fill my head
Those wishes were never for granted
[Verse 3]
You'll drop for a new charm
Put the thunder in my arms
Hope for them to close
Leave nothing to my side
Take all I recognise
And varnish your old blows

Burn the bed and the dreams I've never met
Those wishes were never for granted
So burn the bed I'll face the wind and fill my head
Those wishes were never for granted
Oh, those wishes were never for granted3Embed
