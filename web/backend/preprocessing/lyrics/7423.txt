150 ContributorsTo Live and Die In L.A. Lyrics[Intro]
“Street Science, you’re on the air. What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pac’s new one?”
“I love 2Pac’s new record.”
“Right, but don’t you feel like that creates uh tension between East and West? I mean, he’s talking about killing people, ‘I had sex with your wife’ — and not in those words. But he’s talking about, ‘I wanna see you deceased’…"

[Intro: 2Pac]
I love L.A
No Doubt
To live and die in L.A. (California)
No matter what you say about Los Angeles
It's still the only place for me
It never rains in Southern California

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
What was a friend, now a ghost in the dark
Cold part about it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen'
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset, likin' the sin
What's the worst they can do to a nigga?
Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail
You might also like[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
My angels sing
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
It's the city of angels and constant danger
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera
On the curb watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters
I observe so many niggas gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen' right across from hell
I can't cry, ‘cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
‘Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in 'em
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in L.A
[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angels sing
You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A
You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, Brown Pride in the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember KDAY? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love yo' hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this motherfucker permed out
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Heron, Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A
[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angels sing
You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A
You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see
Let my angels sing

[Outro: 2Pac]
