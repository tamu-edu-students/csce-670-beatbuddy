Boy, I, boy, I, boy, I know
I know you get the feels (Yeah)
Boy, I, boy, I, boy, I know

[Verse 1: Nayeon, Momo, Sana, Tzuyu]
Uh, I'm so curious
’Bout ya boy, wanna keep it cool
But I know everytime you move
Got me frozen, I
Get so shy, it's obvious (Yeah, yeah)
Catching feels like butterflies
If I say what's on my mind
Would I hit bullseye? (Woo)
Shoot! I’m ready, aim and fire (Fire!)

[Refrain: Tzuyu, Jihyo, Dahyun, Nayeon]
Baby, I (Woah, wow)
Feel like Cupid's alive
Ali-i-ive tonight
Yeah, tonight
If your heart beats the same way
Let me know (Yeah, let me know)
'Cause I'm boom-boom-boom
From head to toe and I (From head to toe)
