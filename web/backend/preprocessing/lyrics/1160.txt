What you thought was your daddy was nothing but a…
While you were sitting home alone at age thirteen
Your real daddy was dyin'
Sorry you didn't see him, but I'm glad we talked"

Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive, yeah

"You're still alive," she said, oh, and do I deserve to be?

Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, hey, I'm still alive
Yeah, I, ooh, I'm still alive!
