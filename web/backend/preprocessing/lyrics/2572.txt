Ayy, ayy
Gang, gang, gang
Shooters the gang, gang, gang
Load up the bang, bang, bang
Bang
Gang, gang
The gang, gang (Great John on the beat by the way), gang, gang, gang, gang
Look, huh

[Chorus]
Niggas like, "Sheff, you be movin' too hot"
"You got nothin' to prove, you the king of this shit"
'Member days posted with thirties inside of the Glock
I was itchin' to move on a lick
Niggas be talking real hot for the 'net
But they see me in person, they all on my dick
I got they hearts in my pocket, no bully
But I could be bullyin' whole lotta shit, look
Push me to the limit
Let's see who really tryna get it, okay
Push me to the limit
And let's see who really, really with it
Don't see no Suburbans, who spinnin'?
(Don't see no Suburbans, who spinnin'? Them niggas is lyin')
Don't see no Suburbans, who spinnin'?
Don't see no Suburbans, who spinnin'? Look
You might also like[Verse 1]
He got a black flag, nigga, take it off
You get shot down if you play his songs
I keep a Glock round, I would let it off
This a diss track, this is not a song
I got 'em thinkin' it's voodoo
I'm a Cane Corso, you poodle
I been in the field like manure
Can't talk on my name 'cause I'll prove it
I'm feelin' like, feelin' like who really want it?
You niggas my sons, I ain't feel like abortin' again
Niggas can't mention no money
I double the offer and you know it's off with his head
Just pass me the chop, let me fold 'em
Me by myself, I'll do it to you
Run up, get done up, on M8V3N, huh
Me by myself, I'll give it to you

[Chorus]
Them niggas like, "Sheff, you be movin' too hot"
"You got nothin' to prove, you the king of this shit"
'Member days posted with thirties inside of the Glock
I was itchin' to move on a lick
Niggas be talking real hot for the 'net
But they see me in person, they all on my dick
I got they hearts in my pocket, no bully
But I could be bullyin' whole lotta shit, look
Push me to the limit
Let's see who really tryna get it, okay
Push me to the limit
Let's see who really, really with it
Don't see no Suburbans, who spinnin'?
(Don't see no Suburbans, who spinnin'? Them niggas is lyin')
Don't see no Suburbans, who spinnin'?
Don't see no Suburbans, who spinnin'? Look, look
[Verse 2]
Lyin' in they raps for the clout
Heard that boy a snitch, fish 'em out
Boy, I got the wave, you in drought
Reason why my dick in they mouth
No, this ain't dance music, nigga (I bust a bop, I don't dance)
No, this ain't chill music, nigga, huh (I'm tryna drill, I want 'em dead)
This for the streets, so fuck your say
Don't care if this get no radio play, huh
Bang on any who play
My flow so sick, fuck any who hate, huh
Oh, you tryna bust māthās?
Shots spin him, that's bachata
Stand over niggas and buh-blocka
The king? No, I'm da massah, nigga

[Outro]
M8V3N, M8V3N gang (Don't see no Suburbans, who spinnin'?)
