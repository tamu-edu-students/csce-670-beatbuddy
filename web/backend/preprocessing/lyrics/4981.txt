All this is no coincidence
Just, just, by my feeling
The whole world is different from yesterday
Just, just, with your joy
When you called me
I became your flower
As if we were waiting
We bloom until we ache
Maybe it's the providence of the universe
It just had to be that
You know, I know
You are me, I am you

[Chorus: Jimin]
As much as my heart flutters, I'm worried
The destiny is jealous of us
Just like you I'm so scared
When you see me, when you touch me
The universe has moved for us
Without missing a single thing
Our happiness was meant to be
'Cause you love me, and I love you

[Verse 2: Jimin]
You're my penicillin, saving me, saving me
My angel, my world
I'm your Calico cat, here to see you
Love me now, touch me now

Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Since the creation of the universe
Everything was destined
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)

[Outro: Jimin]
Let me love, let me love you
Let me love, let me love you24Embed
