17 ContributorsOblivion Lyrics[Verse 1]
Since I was young, I knew I'd find you
But our love was a song, sung by a dying swan

[Chorus]
And in the night, you hear me calling, you hear me calling
And in your dreams, you see me falling, falling

[Verse 2]
Breathe in the light, I'll stay here in the shadows
Waiting for a sign, as the tide grows
Higher, and higher, and higher oo- ooh (oo- ooh)

[Bridge]
And when the nights are long
All the stars recall
Your goodbye
Your goodbye

[Chorus]
And in the night, you hear me calling, you hear me calling
And in your dreams, you see me falling, falling

[Chorus]
And in the night, you hear me calling, you hear me calling
And in your dreams, you see us falling, falling
You might also like[Outro]
Breathe in the light, and say goodbye
Breathe in the light, and say goodbye20Embed Oblivion Oblivion (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) M83;Susanne Sundfør french
