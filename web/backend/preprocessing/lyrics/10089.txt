(I) I am the one
(The one) Who lost control
(Control) But in the end I'll be the
Last man standing
(I) I am the one
(The one) Who sold his soul
(His soul) Forever gone to be the
Last man standing tall

[Verse 1]
Glorious, noble in my mind
Everything, a fight to win
Taking all and giving
Whatever my pride would let me
Not backing down, not giving in

[Pre-Chorus]
I wouldn't lose, I couldn't

[Chorus]
(I) I am the one
(The one) Who lost control
(Control) But in the end I'll be the
Last man standing
(I) I am the one
(The one) Who sold his soul
(His soul) Forever gone to be the
Last man standing tall

I walk alone with my head held high
Never felt that I belonged
Stand my ground at all costs
Running through life with blindfolds
Just for the right, the right to be wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing would rule my world but

[Chorus]
(I) I am the one
(The one) Who lost control
(Control) But in the end I'll be the
Last man standing
(I) I am the one
(The one) Who sold his soul
(His soul) Forever gone to be the
Last man standing tall

[Guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing would rule my world but

[Chorus]
(I) I am the one
(The one) Who lost control
(Control) But in the end I'll be the
Last man standing
(I) I am the one
(The one) Who sold his soul
(His soul) Forever gone to be the
Last man standing
(I) I am the one
(The one) Who lost control
(Control) But in the end I'll be the
Last man standing
(I) I am the one
(The one) Who sold his soul
(His soul) Forever gone to be the
Last man standing tall
[Outro]
Seeing clearer what I've done
I'd refuse to let things go
I could never once admit I'm wrong
And what do I have to show?
Seeing clearer what's at stake
And the things I have to change
I just hope I can, it's not too late
To get a chance to end this pain2Embed
