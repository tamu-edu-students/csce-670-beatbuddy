I never seen you lookin' so bad, my funky one
You tell me that your super fine mind has come undone

[Chorus]
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you, my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a squonk's tears? Well, look at mine
The people on the street have all seen better times

[Chorus]
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you, my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you

[Bridge]
I can tell you all I know, the where to go, the what to do
You can try to run but you can't hide from what's inside of you
You might also like[Chorus]
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you, my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you

[Outro]
Any major dude will tell you1Embed
