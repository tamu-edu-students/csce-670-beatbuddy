[Hook]
I'm coming out
I want the world to know, got to let it show
I'm coming out
I want the world to know, I got to let it show

[Verse 1]
There's a new me coming out and I just had to live
And I wanna give, I'm completely positive
I think this time around, I am gonna do it
Like you never knew it, oh, I'll make it through
The time has come for me to break out of this shell
I have to shout that I am coming out

I've got to show the world all that I wanna be
And all my abilities, there's so much more to me
Somehow I'll have to make them just understand
I got it well in hand and oh how I have planned
I'm spreadin' love, there is no need to fear
And I just feel so good, every time I hear

[Chorus]
I'm coming out, I want the world to know
I got to let it show
I'm coming out, I want the world to know
Got to let it show
