68 ContributorsRise Lyrics[Verse 1: Jack Gilinsky]
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise 'til we fall
They say we got no no no no future at all
They wanna ke-ke-keep us out, can't hold us down anymore
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise 'til we fall

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
When we hit the bottom, nothing gonna stop us
Climb to the top with you-ou
We could be the greatest, ones who never made it
Yeah, I could be talking to you
They tryna hate hate hate
But we won't change, change anything at all, oh
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise 'til we fall

[Chorus: Both]
They think we're just dropouts
Livin' at our moms' house
Parents must be so proud
They know it all
No, they don't speak our language
They say we're too savage, yeah
No, no, we don't give a... anymore
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise 'til we fall
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise 'til we fall
No, they don't speak our language
They say we're too savage, yeah
No, no, we don't give a... anymore
