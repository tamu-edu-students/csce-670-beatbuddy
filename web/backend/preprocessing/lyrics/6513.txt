I promised myself
I promised I'd wait for you
And the midnight hour
I know you'll shine on through
I promised myself
I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers
You made my dreams come true

[Chorus]
How many of us out there
Feel the need to run and look for shelter?

[Verse 2]
I promised myself
That I'd say a prayer for you
A brand new tomorrow
Where all you wish comes true
I promised myself
That I'd make it up to you
My sister and brother
Know I'm in love with you

[Chorus]
How many of us out there
Feel the pain of losing what was once there?
God I know what people say about her
No mistake who can live without love
You might also like[Bridge]
Promised myself
And I will wait for you

[Chorus]
How many of us out there
Feel the pain of losing what was once there?
God I know what people say about her
No mistake who can live without love

[Verse 3]
I promised myself
I promised I'd wait for you
The midnight hour
I know you'll shine on through
I promised myself
I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers
You made my dreams come true

[Outro]
In the midnight hour
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
In the midnight hour
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
In the midnight hour
I will wait for you
I will wait for youEmbed
