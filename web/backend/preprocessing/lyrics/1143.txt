[Verse 1]
Don't you feel it growing, day by day?
People getting ready for the new
Some are happy, some are sad
Wo-oh-ah, we gotta let the music play
Mh-hm

[Verse 2]
What the people need is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't so hard to do if you know how
Gotta get a message, get it on through
Oh now, mamma don't you ask me why

[Chorus]
Woh-ho-ho, listen to the music
Woh-uh-oh, listen to the music
Woh-uh-oh, listen to the music
All the time

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Well, I know you know better
Everything I say
Meet me in the country for a day
We'll be happy and we'll dance
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away

And if I'm feeling good to you
And you're feeling good to me
There ain't nothing we can't do or say
Feeling good, feeling fine
Oh, baby, let the music play

[Chorus]
Woh-ho-ho, listen to the music
Woh-uh-oh, listen to the music
Woh-uh-oh, listen to the music
All the time

[Bridge]
Like a lazy flowing river
Surrounding castles in the sky
And the crowd is growing bigger
Listening for the happy sounds
And I got to let them fly
