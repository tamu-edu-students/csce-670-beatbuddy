I heard the truth was built to bend
A mechanism to suspend
The guilt is what you will require
And still you've got to dance little liar
Just like those fibs to pop and fizz
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz
And you're bound to trip
And she'll detect the fiction on your lips and dig a contradiction up

[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar takes a lot less time

[Verse 2]
I'm sure it's clear and plain to read
It's not an alibi you need just yet
Oh, no, it's something for those beads of sweat
Yes, that will get you back to normal
And after you have dabbed the patch
You'll breathe and then proceed to scratch
The varnish off that newly added calmness
So as not to raise any alarms too soon
You might also like[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt

[Bridge]
The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
Have you got itchy bones? And in all your time alone
Can you hack your mind being riddled
With the wrong memories?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt between the dirt28Embed Dance Little Liar Humbug Arctic Monkeys garage
