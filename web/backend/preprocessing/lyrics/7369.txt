Ain't Nothing Gonna Keep me From You

Wind and fire and fallin' rain

I'll be comin' through

There ain't nothin' gonna keep me from you

My love (no nothing), nothin' gonna keep me from you, my love

I'll find you

Anyplace where you may hide

I'll be by your side

There ain't nothin' gonna keep me from you

My love (no, nothin'), nothin' gonna keep me from you, my love

I'll find you
You might also likeHeaven and earth I will move for you, darlin'

Whatever it takes to be where you are

With a stronger love, let me flow through you, baby

You ain't got the power for breakin' my heart

And forever you'll be my paradise

And I'm reachin' for a dream when you don't even want me to

And baby, I believe you need me there

For the miracle of love we share

And tomorrow I will still be followin' you

I admit it, I'm really a dreamer

And I'm reachin' for a star too high up there for hangin' on

And baby, I believe in 'for all time"

And the miracle of your love and mine
It's a lonely feelin' when the meaning's gone

I'm confessin', I don't wanna let you go

And I'm burnin' for the love

That you don't show me anymore

And all of the dreams that we whispered about

They went into my heart and they never came out

And a love like this can die if we don't let it grow

Wind and fire and fallin' rain

I'll be comin' through

There ain't nothin' gonna keep me from you

My love (no nothing), nothin' gonna keep me from you, my love

I'll find you

Anyplace where you may hide
I'll be by your side

There ain't nothin' gonna keep me from you

My love (no, nothin'), nothin' gonna keep me from you, my love

I'll find you

Heaven and earth I will move for you, darlin'

Whatever it takes to be where you are

With a stronger love, let me flow through you, baby

You ain't got the power for breakin' my heart

And forever you'll be my paradise

And I'm reachin' for a dream when you don't even want me to

And baby, I believe you need me there

For the miracle of love we share

And tomorrow I will still be followin' youEmbed Teri Ore Singh Is Kinng Pritam;Rahat Fateh Ali Khan;Shreya Ghoshal indian
