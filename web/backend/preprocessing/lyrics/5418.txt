Charlie Shuffler

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Run away with the one
That's gon' be there 'til it's done
Take the blame for the gun
That's gon' be there for your son
If it's me, I don't know
But at least I'll make her smile
Would you lie here for a while?
Would you lie here 'til I die?

[Post-Chorus: Lil Peep]
When I look at you
I can see right through
And you know it's true
So you love me too
Girl, I always knew
It was me and you
And you'll know it's true
When you say, "I do"

[Verse 1: Cold Hart]
You know I'ma say, "I do" (You know)
'Cause every time I leave I be missin' you (I be missin' you)
And I know you gon' say, "I do" (Oh)
'Cause I look up in your eyes, I can tell it's true (True)
On a winter night
I ran away so far
I ran away with you
We slept inside my car
You might also like[Chorus: Cold Hart]
Run away with the one
That's gon' hold you when you're numb
Takes you home, when you're drunk
Holds your hair, when you're throwin' up
If it's you, I don't know
But at least I had some time
Just to lie here by your side
Countin' all the stars tonight

[Verse 2: Cold Hart]
Girl, I always knew (Uh) I'd see me and you (Uh)
Leaving in a coupe (Yeah) painted baby blue (Blue)
Baby, I need you (Uh), you're like a dream come true (You are)
And yeah, I always knew (Yeah, I knew) that it would be us two
Took the long way home
Bumpin' all our songs
Smokin' cigarettes
And feelin' up her dress
I always miss you most
When I'm smoking dope
They say love kills you slow
That's why I'm with you though

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Run away with the one
That's gon' be there 'til it's done
Take the blame for the gun
That's gon' be there for your son
If it's me, I don't know
But at least I'll make her smile
Would you lie here for a while?
Would you lie here 'til I die?
[Post-Chorus: Lil Peep & Cold Hart]
When I look at you (You)
I can see right through (Right through)
And you know it's true (It's true)
So you love me too (Too)
Girl, I always knew (I always knew)
It was me and you (Me and you)
And you'll know it's true (It's true)
When you say, "I do" (I do)
