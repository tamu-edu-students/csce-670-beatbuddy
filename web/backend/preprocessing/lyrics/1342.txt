Ridin' down, ridin' down
My hand on your seat
The whole way round
I carry band-aids on me now
For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground
Wheels aren't even touchin' the ground
Scared to take them off, but they're so worn down
Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt
If you promise me you'll take them off first

[Chorus]
I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no trainin' wheels left for you
I'll pull 'em off for you
I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no trainin' wheels left for you
I'll pull 'em all off for you

[Verse 2]
Lettin' go, lettin' go
Tellin' you things you already know
I explode, I explode
Askin' you where you want us to go
You've been ridin' two-wheelers all your life
It's not like I'm askin' to be your wife
I wanna make you mine, but that's hard to say
Is this comin' off in a cheesy way?

I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no trainin' wheels left for you
I'll pull 'em all off for you
I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no trainin' wheels left for you
I'll pull 'em all off for you

[Bridge]
(Everything you do) (You do, you do)
(I wanna ride my bike with you) (With you, with you)
(No trainin' wheels left for you)

[Chorus]
I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no trainin' wheels left for you
I'll pull 'em all off for you
I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no trainin' wheels left for you
I'll pull 'em all off for you64Embed Training Wheels Cry Baby (Deluxe Edition) Melanie Martinez electro
