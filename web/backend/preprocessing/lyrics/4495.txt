I'm born to run down rocky cliffs
Give me grace, bury my sins
Shattered glass and black holes
Can't hold me back from where I need to go
Yellow hills and valleys deep
I watch them move under my feet
Stranger things have come and gone
To see the world and take the throne

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't hold back
Oh, I won't hold back

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run
I'm gonna spend my time like tomorrow won't come
Do whatever I want like I'm born to run
I wanna see Paris, I wanna see Tokyo
I wanna be careless even if I break my bones
I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run

[Verse 2]
A winding road where strangers meet
To feel the love of a warm drink
My body moves, it's speaking loud
Don't have to say what I'm thinking now
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Don't hold back
Oh, I won't hold back

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run
I'm gonna spend my time like tomorrow won't come
Do whatever I want like I'm born to run
I wanna see Paris, I wanna see Tokyo
I wanna be careless even if I break my bones
I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run

[Bridge]
All these things I've seen and done
I live my life like I'm born to run
All these things I've seen and done
I live my life like I'm born to run
(I was born, born, born, born, born to run
I was born, born, born, born, born to run)
All these things I've seen and done
I live my life like I'm born to run

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run
I'm gonna spend my time like tomorrow won't come
Do whatever I want like I'm born to run
I wanna see Paris, I wanna see Tokyo
I wanna be careless even if I break my bones
I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run5Embed
