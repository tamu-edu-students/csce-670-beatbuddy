54 ContributorsEyes Without a Face Lyrics[Verse 1: Billy Idol]
I'm all out of hope
One more bad break could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone to tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease, but hard to get release

[Chorus: Billy Idol & Perri Lister]
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace, your eyes without a face

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ch-ch

[Verse 2: Billy Idol]
I spent so much time
Believing all the lies to keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth for loving what was you

[Chorus: Billy Idol & Perri Lister]
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace, your eyes without a face

[Bridge: Billy Idol]
When you hear the music, you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket, then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas
Ooh, the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down
Oh-oh-oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, trying to stay hip
I'm thinking of you and you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: Billy Idol]
Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once so alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realise
[Chorus: Billy Idol & Perri Lister]
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace, your eyes without a face

[Post-Chorus]
Such a human waste, your eyes without a face

[Outro: Billy Idol]
And now it's getting worse10Embed
