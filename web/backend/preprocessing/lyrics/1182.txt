43 ContributorsIn Too Deep Lyrics[Verse 1]
The faster we're fallin', we're stoppin' and stallin'
We're runnin' in circles again
Just as things were lookin' up, you said it wasn't good enough
But still, we're tryin' one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under

[Verse 2]
Seems like each time I'm with you, I lose my mind
Because I'm bendin' over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain, but when you're drivin' me insane
Well then I think it's time that we took a break

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under ('Stead of goin' under)
'Stead of goin' under

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
So believe me, it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

[Chorus]
I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under

[Outro]
Instead of goin' under again
Instead of goin' under, 'stead of goin' under again
'Stead of goin' under again ('Stead of goin' under again)16Embed
