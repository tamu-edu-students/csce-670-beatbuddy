23 ContributorsWar of Change Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's a truth that in love and war
Worlds collide and hearts get broken
I want to live like I know I'm dying
Take up my cross, not be afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend your locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me

[Chorus]
Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

[Verse 2]
It creeps in like a thief in the night
Without a sign, without a warning
But we are ready and prepared to fight
Raise up your swords, don't be afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me

Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

[Bridge]
This is a warning, like it or not
I break down, like a record spinning
Gotta get up
So back off
This is a warning, like it or not
I'm tired of listenin', I'm warning you, don't try to get up
There's a war going on inside of me tonight (Don't be afraid)
There's a war going on inside of me tonight (Don't be afraid)

[Chorus]
Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change
It's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change27Embed
