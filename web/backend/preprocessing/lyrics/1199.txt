I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey-yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, look what you started, the temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move (Move)
Before I make a move (Move)

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, yeah
This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby

Oh, baby, look what you started, the temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move (Move)
Before I make a move (Move)

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret (Mm)
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you ('Cause I'm so into you)

[Bridge]
Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh-woah, yeah

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up (Light me up) and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous (Dangerous), but, baby, that's how I want it (How I want it)
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you (No, ayy)
Got everyone watchin' us (Watchin' us), so, baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous (Scandalous), but, baby, don't let them see it (Yeah)
A little less conversation (Yeah) and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you (Ooh, ooh)
[Outro]
So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
Little dangerous
A little dangerous, my boy (How I want it)
A little less conversation
And a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you
Into you, into you ('Cause I'm so into you)131Embed
