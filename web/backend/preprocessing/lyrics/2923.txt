Ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh (Ah)

[Verse 1]
Nine millimetre, strapped with that heat (Wha!)
Vampire slayer, stake's on me (Woo)
Bow and arrow, call me chief Cherokee (Ooh-ooh)
I'll go animal to keep you next to me (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you lay me down in (Hey), in some supernatural way
And you take my body (Hey) to the Himalayan sea
Purify me (Woo), resurrect me from the grave
Baby, darlin' (Hey), I'll do anything you say

[Chorus]
I'll, I'll kill, I'll kill for a little drop of your good love
I'll rob and steal stars to keep it lit up in your world
The alphabet need only U and S, 'cause all we'll ever need is us
I'll kill, I'll kill for a little drop of your good love

[Verse 2]
Baby, open thе door for me
Tell me, just what I did to makе you go so quiet
Who's he? Who is he? Must be someone else tonight
Believe me, I won't be goin' nowhere without a fight, oh-oh

When you lay me down in (Yeah), in some supernatural way (Woo)
When you take my body (Yeah-yeah) to the Himalayan sea
Sugar, honey (Woo), I'll do anything you say

[Chorus]
I'll, I'll kill, I'll kill for a little drop of your good love
I'll rob and steal stars to keep it lit up in your world
The alphabet need only U and S, 'cause all we'll ever need is us
I'll kill, I'll kill for a little drop of your good love
