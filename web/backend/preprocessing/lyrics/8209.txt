9 ContributorsAll Goes Wrong Lyrics[Verse 1]
Would you take a bullet?
Would you bite the gun?
I've fallen to my knees and yes the war's already won

[Pre-Chorus]
So please don't take me for no fool
I spend a lifetime in your shoes
And now I'm walking, yes, I'm walking

[Chorus]
Through the fire I'll keep burning on
Well I'll hold myself together
When it all goes wrong
The fires, they keep burning on
Well I'll hold myself together

[Post-Chorus]
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
I'll take my time, I'll keep on holding on
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
I'll pull myself together, keep on holding on
You might also like[Verse 2]
Gloves off, we're finished
You bite the hand that feeds
I'll nurse your battle scars
But you'll leave my heart to bleed

[Pre-Chorus]
So please don't take me for no fool
I spend a lifetime in your shoes
And now I'm walking, yes, I'm walking

[Chorus]
Through the fire I'll keep burning on
Well I'll hold myself together

[Post-Chorus]
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
I'll take my time, I'll keep on holding on
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
I'll pull myself together, keep on holding on

[Bridge]
Just like I take my faints
You keep playing the same old games
But remember, but remember, oh no
[Outro]
Through dark nights, we burn right til' the sunset, til' the sunset
Through dark nights, we burn right til' the sunset, til' the sunset
Through dark nights, we burn right til' the sunset, til' the sunset

[Chorus]
Through the fire I'll keep burning on
Well I'll hold myself together

[Post-Chorus]
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
I'll take my time, I'll keep on holding on
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
I'll pull myself together, keep on holding onEmbed
