When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized
The time I saw
Flowers in your hair

[Pre-Chorus 1]
See, it takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

[Verse 2]
So then we grew a little
And knew a lot
And how we demonstrated
It to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause it's a long road to wisdom
But it's a short one to bein' ignored

[Chorus]
Be in my eyes
And be in my heart
Be in my eyes, aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart
You might also like[Verse 3]
So now I think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it's not too late
'Cause you're so attractive
And the way you move
I won't close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus 3]
'Cause it takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

[Chorus]
So be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes, aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart5Embed
