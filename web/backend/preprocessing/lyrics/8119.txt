26 ContributorsGold Lyrics[Verse 1]
Thank you for coming home
Sorry that the chairs are all worn
I left them here I could have sworn
These are my salad days
Slowly being eaten away
Just another play for today
Oh, but I'm proud of you, but I'm proud of you
Nothing left to make me feel small
Luck has left me standing so tall

[Chorus]
Gold (gold)
Always believe in your soul
You've got the power to know
You're indestructible, always believing
You are gold (gold)
Glad that you're bound to return
There's something I could have learned
You're indestructible, always believing

[Verse 2]
After the rush has gone
I hope you find a little more time
Remember we were partners in crime
It's only two years ago
The man with the suit and the face
You knew that he was there on the case
Now he's in love with you, he's in love with you
And love is like a high prison wall
And you could leave me standing so tall
You might also like[Chorus]
Gold (gold)
Always believe in your soul
You've got the power to know
You're indestructible, always believing
You are gold (gold)
Glad that you're bound to return
Something I could have learned
You're indestructible, always believing

[Bridge]
Love is like a high prison wall
You could leave me standing so tall

[Chorus]
Gold (gold)
Always believe in your soul
You got the power to know
You're indestructible, always believing
You are gold (gold)
Glad that you're bound to return
Something I could have learned
You're indestructible, always believing
(You are, gold)
Always believe in your soul
You've got the power to know
You're indestructible, always believing
'Cause you are gold (gold)
I'm glad that you're bound to return
Something I could have learned
You're indestructible, always believing (gold)
