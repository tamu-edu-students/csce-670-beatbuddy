3 ContributorsMalibu Lyrics[Verse 1: Virginia to Vegas]
I must've called you
Called you thirty times, need you to pick up
Before I lose my mind because I want you
I want you in my life
And I still miss you when I think about that time

[Pre-Chorus: Virginia to Vegas]
We went down to Malibu, ooh-ooh
In my BMW, ooh-ooh
I didn't care about the view, ooh-ooh
All I could do was look at you, ooh-ooh

[Chorus: Virginia to Vegas]
In your scuffed up chucks with your hair tied back
In a white tank top and your nails jet black
Got a Louis V bag with and an XO tat, just me and you
Your sky blue eyes, I could die inside
Wanna dive right in, fuck it, I just might
When I'm here with you everything's alright, in Malibu (In Malibu)

[Verse 2: Virginia to Vegas]
I should've told you
Told you every time that you were perfect
'Cause you'rе still perfect in my mind
And I still want you, want you
Want you in my life
And I still miss you whеn I think about that time

When I'm here with you everything's alright, in Malibu (In Malibu)
