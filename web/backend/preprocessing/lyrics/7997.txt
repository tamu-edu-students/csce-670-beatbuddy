15 ContributorsHeaven Lyrics[Verse 1]
Got a picture of your house
And you're standin' by the door
It's black and white and faded
And it's lookin' pretty worn
See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back
Memories are gray
But man, they're really coming back

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl

[Chorus]
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say

[Verse 2]
How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside 'em
Like a blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night
And you're in bed asleep
I'll wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe

I don't need to be a superman, ah ah
As long as you will always be my biggest fan

[Chorus]
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now the lights are goin' out
Along the boulevard
The memories come rushin' back
And it makes it pretty hard
I got nowhere left to go
No one really cares
I don't know what to do
But I'm never givin' up on you

[Chorus]
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends say
I know we're gonna find a way
[Outro]
(Heaven)
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh
(Heaven)
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh oh
(Heaven)
It's not too far away
Oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh
YeahEmbed
