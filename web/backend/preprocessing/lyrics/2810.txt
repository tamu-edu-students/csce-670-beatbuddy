50 ContributorsBorn to Be Yours Lyrics[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I know I've given up
A hundred times before
But I know a miracle
Is not something to ignore

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
You take me for a fool
You take me for a fool

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I never knew anybody ‘til I knew you
I never knew anybody ‘til I knew you
And I know when it rains, oh, it pours
And I know I was born to be yours
I never knew anybody ‘til I knew you
I never knew anybody ‘til I knew you
And I know when it rains, oh, it pours
And I know I was born to be yours

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
Are you the only one
Lost in the millions?
Or are you my grain of sand
That's blowing in the wind?
You might also like[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I never knew anybody ‘til I knew you
I never knew anybody ‘til I knew you
And I know when it rains, oh, it pours
And I know I was born to be yours
I never knew anybody ‘til I knew you
I never knew anybody ‘til I knew you
And I know when it rains, oh, it pours
And I know I was born to be yours

[Bridge: Dan Reynolds]
I was born to be yours
I was born, born, born, born
I was born to be yours
I was born, born, born
I was born to be yours
I was born, born, born, born
I was born to be yours
(I was born)
Oh-woah

[Outro: Dan Reynolds]
Oh-woah (hey)
Born to be yours
I was born, born, born, born
I was born to be yours
I was born, born, born (hey)
I was born to be yours
I was born, born, born, born (I was born)
