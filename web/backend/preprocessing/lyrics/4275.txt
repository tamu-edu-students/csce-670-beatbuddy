15 ContributorsCry to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
When your baby leaves you all alone
And nobody calls you on the phone
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Well, here I am, my honey
C'mon, you cry to me

[Verse 2]
When you're all alone in your lonely room
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
C'mon, c'mon, cry to me

[Bridge]
Whoa, nothing can be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness, loneliness, such a waste of time, oh oh yes
You don't ever have to walk alone, you see
Come on take my hand, and baby, won't you walk with me?
Whoa yeah

[Verse 3]
When you're waiting for a voice to come
In the night but there's no one
Don't you feel like crying? (Cry to me)
Don't you feel like crying? (Cry to me)
Don't you feel like cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cry (Cry to me) cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-crying? (Cry to me)
Don't you feel like cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cry (Cry to me) cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-crying?You might also like2Embed
