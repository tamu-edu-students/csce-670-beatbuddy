1 ContributorSpooky, Scary Skeletons (Undead Tombstone Remix Extended) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Spooky, scary skeletons send shivers down your spine
Shrieking skulls will shock your soul, seal your doom tonight
Spooky, scary skeletons speak with such a screech

They'll sneak from their sarcophagus and just won't leave you be

[Chorus]
Spooky scary, spooky scary, spooky scary, spooky scary
Scary, -cary, -cary, -cary, -cary

Sticks and stones will break your bones, they seldom let you snooze
Spooky, scary skeletons will wake you with a—
