[Verse 1]
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

[Verse 2]
The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now, we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire, yeah

[Verse 3]
The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now, we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire, yeah

[Verse 4]
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
