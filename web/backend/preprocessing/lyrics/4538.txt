25 ContributorsLost in the Woods Lyrics[Verse 1]
Again, you're gone
Off on a different path than mine
I'm left behind
Wondering if I should follow
You had to go
And of course, it's always fine
I probably could catch up with you tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
But is this what it feels like
To be growing apart?
When did I become the one
Who's always chasing your heart?

[Chorus]
Now I turn around and find
I am lost in the woods
North is south, right is left
When you're gone
I'm the one who sees you home
But now I'm lost in the woods
And I don't know what path you are on
I'm lost in the woods

[Verse 2]
Up 'til now
The next step was a question of how
I never thought it was a question of whether
Who am I if I'm not your guy?
Where am I if we're not together
Forever?
You might also like[Chorus]
Now I know you're my true north
'Cause I am lost in the woods
Up is down, day is night
When you're not there
Oh, you're my only landmark
So I'm lost in the woods
Wondering if you still care

[Bridge]
But I'll wait
For a sign (For a sign)
That I'm your path
'Cause you are mine (You are mine)
Until then
I'm lost in the woods

[Outro]
Lost in the woods (Lost, lost)
In the woods, in the woods (Lost in the woods)
I'm lost in the woods
Lost in the woods (Lost, lost)
(I'm lost)
I'm lost in the woods7Embed
