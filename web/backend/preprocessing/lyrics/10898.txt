Nothing seems to kill me
No matter how hard I try
Nothing is closing my eyes
Nothing can beat me down for your pain or delight
No

[Verse 2]
And nothing seems to break me
No matter how far I fall
Nothing can break me at all
Not one for giving up, though not invincible
I know

[Pre-Chorus]
I've given everything I need, I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
I've given everything I could
To blow it to Hell and gone
Burrow down in and

[Chorus]
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world

[Verse 3]
Someone tried to tell me something
"Don't let the world bring you down"
Nothing can do me in before I do myself
Save it for your own and the ones you can help
No

I've given everything I need, I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
I've given everything I could
To blow it to Hell and gone
Burrow down in and

[Chorus]
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Want to make it understood
Wanting though I never would
Trying though I know it's wrong
Blowing it to Hell and gone
Wishing though I never could

[Chorus]
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside world

[Outro]
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside world
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside
Blow up the outside, blow up the outside6Embed
