8 ContributorsRight Now Lyrics[Intro]
Tear down
These  walls
Well  this can't go on forever
Something's gotta give

[Verse 1]
How can I relate to a world I feel is broken
To  the minds that I feel won't open
And  how can I speak life
When all I see is death and all I see is strife
Yeah,  I'll tell them

[Pre-Chorus]
Look into their eyes
Listen to their cries
Voices speak demise

[Chorus]
Tear  down
These walls
Well this can't go on forever
Something's gotta give
Burn down
And relearn
Well we won't be here forever
Something's gotta change
Right now
Right now
Right now

How can we exist in a constant state of crisis
Society in conflict
All the ignorance betrays a weakness
Too much pride to admit there's a sickness
Vacant emotions
Like walking corpses

[Pre-Chorus]
Look into their eyes
Listen to their cries
Voices speak demise

[Chorus]
Tear down
These walls
Well this can't go on forever
Something's gotta give
Burn down
And relearn
Well we won't be here forever
Something's gotta change
Right now
Right now
Right now
Right now
[Bridge]
If we all take a second and listen
Voice of reason is how we can end this
We can't waste a minute
It needs to happen now
Drop your weapons and all your defences
Drop your pride get the point that we're missing
We can't waste a minute
It needs to happen now
It needs to happen now

[Chorus]
Tear down
These walls
Well this can't go on forever
Something's gotta give
Burn down
And relearn
Well we won't be here forever
Something's gotta change
Right now
Right now
Right now
