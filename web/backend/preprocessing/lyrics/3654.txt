Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 1: Pete Townshend & Roger Daltrey]
He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

[Post-Chorus: Pete Townshend & Roger Daltrey]
How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?

[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see, no lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

[Verse 4: Roger Daltrey]
Even on my favourite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball8Embed Pinball Wizard Tommy The Who psych-rock
