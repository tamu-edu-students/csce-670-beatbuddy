40 ContributorsToo Late To Say Goodbye Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh my precious ember burning, my sweet glowing light
From the moment I first saw you, I was yours and you were mine
Deep down we both knew you were trouble by design
And the echo of my mother's words, "Baby, don't you play with fire"

[Pre-Chorus]
I was always playing the part
First love only set by a spark
There was no way changing my mind

[Chorus]
Now I'm under your spell, trapped in a lie
Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
No turning back, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
It's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart
Wish we could go back to the start
But oh my god, is this real?
No more time
It's too late, it's too late to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I can hear the sounds of sirens circling around
Forced to watch the ashes floating, softly drifting to the ground
Deep down we both knew it was trouble by design
And the echo of my mother's words, "Baby, don't you play with fire"

[Chorus]
Now I'm under your spell, trapped in a lie
Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
No turning back, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
It's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart
Wish we could go back to the start
But oh my god, is this real?
No more time
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to say goodbye

[Bridge]
After all the dust has settled, we can settle down
Just the two of us forever, no one else around
No one else around
Around

[Chorus]
Now I'm under your spell, trapped in a lie
Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
No turning back, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
It's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart
Wish we could go back to the start
But oh my god
No escape
No more time
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to say goodbye19Embed Too Late To Say Goodbye Tell Me I'm Pretty Cage The Elephant punk-rock
