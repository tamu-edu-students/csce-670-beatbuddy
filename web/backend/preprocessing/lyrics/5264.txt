My heartbeat
Should have known better, better

You hang around
Only call me when you feel down
And it’s not for me
All I seem to do is disagree
You hang around
Only call me when you feel down
And you disagree
All I know is you’re enough for me

My heartbeat
Should have known better
So I wrote it in a love…
My heartbeat
Should have known better, better
So I wrote it in a love…
My heartbeat
Should have known better
So I wrote it in a love…
My heartbeat
Should have known better, better
So I wrote it in a love...

S.O.S. it’s time you give me your best guess
S.O.S. can’t believe you left me in this mess

My heartbeat
Should have known better

My heartbeat
Should have known better
So I wrote it in a love letter
Should have known better

My heartbeat
Should have known better
So I wrote it in a love...
