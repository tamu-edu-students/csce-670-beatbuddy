Is this really love that I am feeling inside?
I know I get afraid when I look into your eyes
For what I am feeling inside

Feel feel inside
Deep deep down inside
[10x]

Deep deep deep deep deep down inside
Deep deep deep deep deep deep down inside

Feel feel feel inside
Deep deep down inside
[2x]

I try to find a way, to get you off my mind
Is this really love that I am feeling inside?
I know I get afraid when I look into your eyes
For what I am feeling inside

Feel feel inside
Deep deep down inside
Is this really love that I'm feeling inside?

I try to find a way, to get you off my mind
Is this really love that I am feeling inside?
I know I get afraid when I look into your eyes
For what I am feeling insideYou might also likeEmbed
