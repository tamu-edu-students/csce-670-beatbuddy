Back to life, back to reality

Back to the here and now, oh yeah
Show me how, decide what you want from me
Tell me maybe I could be there for you

However do you want me
However do you need me, how
However do you want me

However do you want me
However do you need me, how
However do you want me
However do you need me

[Verse 2]
Back to life, back to the present time
Back from a fantasy, yes
Tell me now, take the initiative
I'll leave it in your hands until you're ready

No more room for trouble and fuss (No more room, no, no, no there's not)
