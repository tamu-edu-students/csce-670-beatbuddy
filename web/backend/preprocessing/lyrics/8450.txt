20 ContributorsGunslinger Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, you've been alone
I've been gone for far too long
But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you
Never let it show
The pain I've grown to know
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

[Chorus]
I reach towards the sky, I've said my goodbyes
My heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
My prayers have made it through yeah
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

[Verse 2]
Letters keep me warm
Helped me through the storm
But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you

[Chorus]
I reach towards the sky, I've said my goodbyes
My heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
My prayers have made it through yeah
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

I've always been true
I've waited so long just to come hold you
I'm making it through, it's been far too long
We've proven our love over time's so strong
In all that we do
The stars in the night, they lend me their light
To bring me closer to heaven with you

[Bridge]
(Bring me closer)
But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you

[Chorus]
I reach towards the sky, I've said my goodbyes
My heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
My prayers have made it through yeah
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

[Outro]
And with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you15Embed Gunslinger Avenged Sevenfold Avenged Sevenfold metal
