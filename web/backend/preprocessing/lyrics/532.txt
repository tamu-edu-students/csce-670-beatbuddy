Smoking cigarettes on the roof
You look so pretty and I love this view

[Pre-Chorus]
We fell in love in October
That's why, I love fall
Looking at the stars
Admiring from afar

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my girl
My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my world
My world, my world, my world
You will be my girl

[Verse 2]
Smoking cigarettes on the roof
You look so pretty and I love this view
Don't bother looking down
We're not going that way
At least I know, I am here to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
We fell in love in October
That's why, I love fall
Looking at the stars
Admiring from afar
(My girl, my girl, my girl)
