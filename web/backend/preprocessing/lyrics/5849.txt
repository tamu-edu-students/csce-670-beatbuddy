46 ContributorsSecret Door Lyrics[Chorus]
Fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

[Verse 1]
She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here
It's a magnolia celebration to be attended on a Wednesday night
It's better that than get a reputation as a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion she came to in this overture

[Bridge]
And the secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along

[Verse 2]
Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
Then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
And unveiling the unexpected
I, who was earlier reluctant
Was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature survive in such a habitat?
You might also like[Bridge]
And the secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along
Even if they were to find us
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied

[Chorus]
As all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
Ones you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence
But you're daft to think she'd care

[Outro]
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
