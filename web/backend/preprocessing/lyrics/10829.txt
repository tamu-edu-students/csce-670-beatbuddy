22 ContributorsAre You Lonely Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know that you're calling me
To light up and let the shadow
That follows you underneath
I know that you’re calling me
I don't want to play it safe
'Cause I don’t contend like that
Just keep falling into me
I know I got your back

[Chorus]
Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you

[Verse 2]
Whoever said it was easy
They never know what we'd do
Oh, when these walls fall down
I'll stand by you
What you believe in
I'll give it to you
’Cause when these walls fall down
I’ll stand by you
You might also like[Chorus]
Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?
I'll stand by you, I’ll stand by you
Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you1Embed
