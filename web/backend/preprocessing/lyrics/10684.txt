1 ContributorI Confess Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me what would you do
If I told you the truth, ah
I've been holdin' my breath
Just to get up next to you
So feed me love, feed me lies
I see the sun, see the stars, ah
And I just want you in mine
Nobody else will ever do

[Pre-Chorus]
I like the way you act dangerous
Even better with the lights down low
I know this life was never made for us
But baby I was made for you

[Chorus]
I confess, ah
That I like your hands better grippin' my chest, ah
And I wanna be someone that you can forget, ah
You should come and get to know me bеtter
Won't leave you thе way we met, wanna make your body move

[Post-Chorus]
I confess
I confess
(Won't leave you the way we met, wanna make your body move)

Tell me, is it obvious?
That you're the one thing on my mind
So what is it you want with us?
I wanna make you mine
Don't wanna waste your time (Waste your time, darlin')

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I like the way you act dangerous (Oh)
Even better with the lights down low
I know this life was never made for us
But, baby, I was made for you

[Chorus]
I confess, ah
That I like your hands better grippin' my chest, ah
And I wanna be someone that you can forget, ah
You should come and get to know me better
Won't leave you the way we met, wanna make your body move

[Post-Chorus]
I confess
I confess
(Won't leave you the way we met, wanna make your body move)

[Outro]
(Won't leave you the way we met, wanna make your body move)Embed
