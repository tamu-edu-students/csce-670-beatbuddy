Do you ever see someone and think
"Wow, God must hate me"
'Cause he spent so much time on them
And for me, he got lazy?

[Verse 1]
Got ample mental illness, personality flaws
While their only flaw seems to be that they have none at all

[Refrain]
Do you ever see someone and think
"Wow, God must hate me"?

[Chorus]
I'll let Him take accountability
For everything that's wrong with me
Can't hold myself responsible
So I blame the metaphysical
If Jesus died for all our sins
He left one behind, the body I'm in
Same hands that made the moon and the stars
Got carpal tunnel and forgot some parts
I don't know what I believe
But it's easier to think
He made a mistake with me
You might also like[Verse 2]
Do you ever see someone and think, "Wow, they got lucky"?
The craftsmanship of their bones, their brain, and their body
When I look into the mirror for too long it hurts
They don't track how many steps it takes to burn off dessert

[Refrain]
Do you ever see someone and think
"Wow, they got lucky"?

[Chorus]
I'll let Him take accountability
For everything that's wrong with me
Can't hold myself responsible
So I blame the metaphysical
If Jesus died for all our sins
He left one behind, the body I'm in
Same hands that made the moon and the stars
Got carpal tunnel and forgot some parts
I don't know what I believe
But it's easier to think
He made a mistake with me

[Outro]
Do you ever see someone and think
"Wow, God must hate me"
'Cause he spent so much time on them
And for me, he got lazy?3Embed God Must Hate Me God Must Hate Me Catie Turner songwriter
