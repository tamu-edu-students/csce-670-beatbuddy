36 ContributorsHeart in a Cage Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I don't feel better when I'm fucking around
And I don't write better when I'm stuck in the ground
So don't teach me a lesson 'cause I've already learned
Yeah, the sun will be shining and my children will burn

[Hook]
Oh, the heart beats in its cage

[Verse 2]
I don't want what you want, I don't feel what you feel
See, I'm stuck in a city but I belong in a field
Yeah, we got left, left, left, left, left, left, left
Now it's three in the morning and you're eating alone

[Hook]
Oh, the heart beats in its cage

[Bridge]
All our friends, they're laughing at us
All of those you loved, you mistrust
Help me, I'm just not quite myself
Look around, there's no one else left

[Verse 3]
I went to the concert and I fought through the crowd
Guess I got too excited when I thought you were around
Oh, he gets left, left, left, left, left, left, left
And I'm sorry you were thinking I would steal your fire
You might also like[Hook]
Oh, the heart beats in its cage
Yes, the heart beats in its cage

[Outro]
And the heart beats in its cage14Embed
