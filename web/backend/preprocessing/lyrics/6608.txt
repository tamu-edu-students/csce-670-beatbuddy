Here's a simple song
Won't stop the rain from coming down
Or your heart from breaking
Here's a simple song
It's never gonna turn this day around
Stop the earth from shaking
It's just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to

[Verse 1]
Well, I know it's not been easy
But easy ain't worth singin' about
Yeah, I know, I know
The time goes slow
But it's always running out

[Chorus]
Here's a simple song
Won't stop the rain from coming down
Or your heart from breaking
Here's a simple song
It's never gonna turn this day around
Stop the earth from shaking
It is just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to

Everything seems to be about timing

[Chorus]
Here's a simple song
Won't stop the rain from coming down
Or your heart from breaking
Just a simple song
Never gonna turn this day around
Stop the earth from shaking
It's just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to

Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to4Embed
