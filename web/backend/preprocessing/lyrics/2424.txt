46 ContributorsGolden Brown Lyrics[Verse 1]
Golden brown, texture like sun
Lays me down, with my mind she runs
Throughout the night, no need to fight
Never a frown with golden brown

[Verse 2]
Every time, just like the last
On her ship, tied to the mast
To distant lands, takes both my hands
Never a frown with golden brown

[Verse 3]
Golden brown, finer temptress
Through the ages, she's heading west
From far away, stays for a day
Never a frown with golden brown

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Never a frown (Never a frown)
(Never a frown) With golden brown (With golden brown)
(With golden brown) Never a frown (Never a frown)
(Never a frown) With golden brown (With golden brown)
(With golden brown) Never a frown (Never a frown)
(Never a frown) With golden brown (With golden brown)
(With golden brown) Never a frown (Never a frown)
(Never a frown) With golden brown (With golden brown)See The Stranglers LiveGet tickets as low as $83You might also like14Embed
