43 ContributorsEternally Yours LyricsBlow the bridge to the past, wipe the fingerprints
Melt your heart encased in wax, steal it with a kiss
Our fate engraved, scar enslaved, as we mutually destruct
Repose, my love, I’ve sinned enough for the both of us

In the name of love...

I’m ready to bury all of my bones
I’m ready to lie but say I won’t
So tell me your secrets and join me in pieces
To rot in this garden made of stones
Eternally yours

I feed like you taught me and selflessly swallow
We coalesce in darkness, so selfishly hollow
Examine the wreckage, writhing in tempo
Invisible anguish casting a shadow

And in the name of love...

I’m ready to bury all of my bones
I’m ready to lie but say I won’t
So tell me your secrets, and join me in pieces
To rot in this garden made of stones
Eternally yours

I would suffer forever to absolve all your pain

And in the name of love

I’m ready to bury all of my bones
I’m ready to lie but say I won’t
So tell me your secrets, and join me in pieces
To rot in this garden made of stones

I’m ready to bleed to make amends
And sleep in this dirt we call our bed
So tell me your secrets,  and join me in pieces
To fall and rewrite the bitter end
Eternally yours

(Eternally yours)
I’m more than willing
To rot in hell with you13Embed
