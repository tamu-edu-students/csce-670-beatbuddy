Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I used to think I love you, now I know it ain't true
Now I know it's not you, 50 on my boxers
Bitch, I know you see me, shinin' in my white tee, it's easy
I'll make it look easy, believe me, we gucci (Free Gucci)
Young punk bitch fuckin' on a young bitch (Yah, yah)
Fell in love when she saw me in the club, bitch
Young punk bitch fuckin' on a drunk bitch (Yah, yah)
Shawty fell in love, now she doin' all my drugs, Yung Bruh

[Refrain: Lil Tracy]
Standin' in the club, like, lil' mama in my eyesight (Yeah, my eyesight)
She goin' home with me tonight, we connect like WiFi (WiFi)
Yayo on the table, Gucci on my waist, too (Yayo)
Got my switchblade, tonight you'll be safe

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
Gemstone switchblade and I will pull it out (Gemstones)
This club goin' up, baby, will you hold me down? (Will you hold me down?)
Hella ice on my wrists, he thought my wrists sprained
I'm in your driveway, baby, let's skrrt away (Skrr, skrr, skrr)

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I used to think I love you, now I know it ain't true
Now I know it's not you, 50 on my boxers
Bitch, I know you see me, shinin' in my white tee, it's easy
I'll make it look easy, believe me, we gucci (Free Gucci)
Young punk bitch fuckin' on a young bitch (Yah, yah)
Fell in love when she saw me in the club, bitch
Young punk bitch fuckin' on a drunk bitch (Yah, yah)
Shawty fell in love, now she doin' all my drugs, Yung Bruh
