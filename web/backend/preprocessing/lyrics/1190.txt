I lost my own belief
Always somethin' breakin' me, was overcome
Walkin' these lonely streets
Even in good company, I want to run

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'm embracin' the way I am
I don't need nobody to hold my hand

[Chorus]
I'm doin' it, doin' it all by myself
I'm movin' it, movin' it all by myself
I'll be my own motivation
I'll listen to nothin' they're sayin'
I'm lovin' me, lovin' me all by myself

[Drop]
All by myself
All by myself, myself
All by my—

[Verse 2]
They turned the best of me into my insecurities
They shout so loud
No parties with fake friends
I never wanna blend into the crowd
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
No more goin' places I don't bеlong
They're gonna say I'm selfish, but I'm just strong

[Chorus]
I'm doin' it, doin' it all by mysеlf
I'm movin' it, movin' it all by myself
I'll be my own motivation
I'll listen to nothin' they're sayin'
I'm lovin' me, lovin' me all by myself

[Drop]
All by myself
All by my-my-my
All by myself, myself

[Bridge]
No more goin' places I don't belong
You can say I'm selfish, but I'm just strong
And now I'm breakin' free from what they wanted me to be
And I'm me, finally, oh

[Chorus]
I'm doin' it, doin' it all by myself-self-self
All by myself-self-self-self
I'll be my own motivation
I'll listen to nothin' they're sayin'
I'm lovin' me, lovin' me all by myself
[Drop]
All by myself, myself
All by myself
All by my-my-my
All by myself, myself
All by myself1Embed
