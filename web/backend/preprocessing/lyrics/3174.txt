If you could only feel the way that I feel
Ready for the war to come my way
Yeah, I struggled so I know what it takes
The pressure only builds 'til it breaks
If you could only feel the way that I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
You may think it's something spiritual

[Chorus]
But I'm betting on the right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough
(Don't need a miracle!)
Right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough
(Don't need a miracle!)

[Post-Chorus]
You might think it's something spiritual
But I don't need a fucking miracle, ayy!

If you could only see the way that I see
You could find the faith to take the leap (Take the leap)
It only took one shot to prove I'm not made of glass
There's no pain you could cause that won't eventually pass
If you could only see the way that I see

[Chorus]
You'd be betting on the right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough
(Don't need a miracle!)
Right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough
(Don't need a miracle!)

[Post-Chorus]
You might think it's something spiritual
But I don't need a fucking miracle!

[Breakdown]
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
My will is stronger!
Stronger! (Stronger! Stronger!)
Wait!
[Pre-Chorus]
You may think it's something spiritual

[Chorus]
But I'm betting on the right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough

Right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough
(Don't need a miracle!)
