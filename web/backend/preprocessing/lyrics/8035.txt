Yeah!
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
All I've ever wanted was destiny to be fulfilled!
It is in my hands
I must not fail, and I must not fail!

[Chorus]
Even through the darkest days
This fire burns, always
This fire burns, always

[Verse 2]
This is the proving ground
As the heat begins to rise
Turn away from yesterday
Tomorrow's in my eyes (Oh!)

[Bridge]
Nevermore to be held down
By the wings of history
Nevermore to be cast aside
This day is mine

Even through the darkest days
This fire burns, always
This fire burns, always

[Bridge]
I will not be denied in this final hour
I will not be denied, this day is mine!
This passion inside me is burning, is burning!
This passion inside me is burning, is burning!

[Chorus]
Even through the darkest days
This fire burns, always (Always!)
This fire burns (Fire burns!), always
Always (Always!)8Embed
