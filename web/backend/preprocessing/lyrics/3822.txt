56 ContributorsUnder Cover of Darkness Lyrics[Verse 1]
Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

[Chorus 1]
And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

[Chorus 2]
And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again
So long, my adversary and friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

[Chorus 3]
I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning yelling, "No more!"
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll be waiting for you48Embed Under Cover of Darkness Angles The Strokes garage
