Little, do you know how I'm breaking while you fall asleep?
Little, do you know I'm still haunted by the memories?
Little, do you know I'm trying to pick myself up piece by piece?
Little, do you know I need a little more time?

[Verse 2: Sierra]
Underneath it all, I'm held captive by the hole inside
I've been holding back for the fear that you might change your mind
I'm ready to forgive you, but forgetting is a harder fight
Little, do you know I need a little more time?

[Chorus: Alex]
I'll wait, I'll wait, I love you like you've never felt the pain
I'll wait, I promise you don't have to be afraid
I'll wait, my love is here, is here to stay
So lay your head on me

[Verse 3: Alex]
Little, do you know I know you're hurting while I'm sound asleep?
Little, do you know all my mistakes are slowly drowning me?
Little, do you know I'm trying to make it better piece by piece?
Little do you know I, I love you 'til the sun dies?

[Chorus: Both, Sierra]
Oh wait, just wait, I love you like I've never felt the pain
Just wait, I love you like I've never been afraid
Just wait, our love is here, is here to stay
So lay your head on me

I'll wait, (I'll wait), I'll wait, (I'll wait)
I love you like you've never felt the pain
I'll wait (I'll wait), I promise you don't have to be afraid
I'll wait, my love is here, is here to stay
So lay your head on me

[Outro: Both, Alex]
Lay your head on me, so lay your head on me
'Cause little, do you know I, I love you 'til the sun dies?57Embed Little Do You Know It's About Us Alex & Sierra pop
