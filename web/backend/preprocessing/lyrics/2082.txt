I woke up, it was seven, I waited 'til eleven
Just to figure out that no one would call
I think I've got a lot of friends, but I don't hear from them
What's another night all alone?
When you're spending everyday on your own
And here it goes

[Chorus]
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me
Tonight

[Verse 2]
And maybe when the night is dead, I'll crawl into my bed
I'm staring at these four walls again
I'll try to think about the last time I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go
And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

[Chorus]
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me

What the hell is wrong with me? Don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me?
Wide awake I'm bored and I can't fall asleep
And every night is the worst night ever

[Bridge]
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid, yeah, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
And I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid

[Chorus]
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me tonight

[Outro]
I'm all alone tonight
Nobody cares tonight
'Cause I'm just a kid tonight12Embed I'm Just a Kid No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls (15th Anniversary Tour Edition) Simple Plan punk-rock
