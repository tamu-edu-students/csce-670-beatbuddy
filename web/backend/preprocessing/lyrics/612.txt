[Verse 1]
You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

[Verse 2]
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

[Chorus]
So love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

[Verse 3]
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin
Is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah
