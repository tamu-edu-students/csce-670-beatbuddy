5 ContributorsStand Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
They had tongues like guns
I had nowhere to run
Yeah, this world can get so lonely
Yeah, the paper and pen
Were my two best friends
'Cause the sad songs understood me
The irony that all my dreams were keeping me from sleeping
Because there's something so fun being young and being dumb
'Cause you're not afraid of feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, all of my demons are kicking and screaming
But I'll never leave them behind
Yeah, maybe I'm crazy but don't try to save me
'Cause I've never felt so alive

[Chorus]
Yeah, when they knock you down, down, down
Kid, you gotta stand up (Stand up)
Stand up (Stand up)
Yeah, when they gotcha down, down, down
Gotta make your own luck (Own luck)
Own luck (Own luck)
So, tell me I'm outta my mind
Give me a sign
Take it one step at a time
I know it's gonna be fine
Open your eyes
Shut up and give it a try
When they knock you down, down, down
Kid, you gotta stand up (Stand up)
Stand up (Stand up)

Everybody go
Ooh, ooh
And everybody go
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
They had eyes like knives
I had nowhere to hide
Yeah, this world can cut you open
But all the scars, they prove
That I fought my way through
So, I always keep 'em showing
'Cause sanity is suicide
And crazy are the legends
But, yeah, I'd rather have fun
Being young and being dumb
Than be saved a spot in heaven

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, all of my demons are kicking and screaming
But I'll never leave them behind
Yeah, maybe I'm crazy but don't try to save me
'Cause I've never felt so alive

[Chorus]
Yeah, when they knock you down, down, down
Kid, you gotta stand up (Stand up)
Stand up (Stand up)
Yeah, when they gotcha down, down, down
Gotta make your own luck (Own luck)
Own luck (Own luck)
So, tell me I'm outta my mind
Give me a sign
Take it one step at a time
I know it's gonna be fine
Open your eyes
Shut up and give it a try
When they knock you down, down, down
Kid, you gotta stand up (Stand up)
Stand up (Stand up)
[Post-Chorus]
Everybody go
Ooh, ooh
And everybody go
Ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, all of my demons are kicking and screaming
But I'll never leave them behind
Yeah, maybe I'm crazy but don't try to save me
'Cause I've never felt so alive

[Chorus]
Yeah, when they knock you down, down, down
Kid, you gotta stand up (Stand up)
Stand up (Stand up)
Yeah, when they gotcha down, down, down
Gotta make your own luck (Own luck)
Own luck (Own luck)
So, tell me I'm outta my mind
Give me a sign

I know it's gonna be fine
Open your eyes
Shut up and give it a try
When they knock you down, down, down
Kid, you gotta stand up (Stand up)
Stand up (Stand up)
