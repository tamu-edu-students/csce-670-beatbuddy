Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing

[Verse 1: LIL DUSTY G & Sample]
I don't want it, you can keep all of your empathy
It's so ironic, I ain't think that they'd remember me
But in my pocket I keep everything they did to me
I ain't forgot it, I kept every single memory
Jealousy (Hahaha; Jealousy)
Popularity (Popularity)
Devilry, directed at me

[Bridge: Sample]
What is your name?
Who is your master?

[Verse 2: LIL DUSTY G & Sample]
Occupy an empty stall and sing a melody
Apologize, but I'm feelin' no sincerity
It's no surprise I've been gifted with this clarity
I can't describe how I hate your similaritiеs
Identities (You don't have any powеr!)
All the same to me
I know the recipe
Fall in line and take a seat
Take a seat, take a seat
Join the master shamelessly
Remember what they said to me? "You can't do it easily"
But recently my frequency has reached its peak
Believe in me, increasingly insidiously
Now they wanna be like meYou might also like1Embed
