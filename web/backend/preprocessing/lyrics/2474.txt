1 ContributorSilver Spoon Lyrics[Verse 1: John Disco]
There's nothing like a bad joke
To make the enemy choke
Can't excuse the punchline
It never works the first time
Look through broken windows
And everybody looks cold
Won't ask for a reason
But shutting up's not easy

[Chorus: John Disco with Sci-Fi Steven]
Tell the world about the silver spoon that I can't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon and I won't understand

[Verse 2: John Disco]
I need secondary sight
Of just what's lurking behind
Step on cracks I'm bleeding
I never stopped believing
Winter gave me shelter
But summer left me freezing
Thirty thousand feet up
My head has taken enough

[Chorus: All]
Tell the world about the silver spoon that I can't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon and I won't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon that I can't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon and I won't understand

Tell the world about the silver spoon that I can't
(Understand)
Tell the world about the silver spoon that I can't
(Understand)

[Verse 3: John Disco]
There's nothing like a bad joke
To make the enemy choke
There's nothing like disaster
To make the heart beat faster
There's nothing like a bad day
To make the enemy say
Life is like bad joke
It's always making me choke
Ha

[Chorus: All]
Tell the world about the silver spoon that I can't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon and I won't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon that I can't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon and I won't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon that I can't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon and I won't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon that I can't understand
Tell the world about the silver spoon and I won't understand
[Outro: John Disco & Manda Rin]
Tell the world about the silver spoon
Tell the world about the silver spoon (Understand)
Tell the world about the silver spoon and I won't understandEmbed
