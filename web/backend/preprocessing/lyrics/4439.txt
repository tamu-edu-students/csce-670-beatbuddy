44 ContributorsWork Lyrics"Are you working? What kind of work do you do?"

- Uh -

"Boy - boy - boy -
What is it you wanna do when you grow up?"

[Chorus]
Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah, surprisingly
I've been layin', waitin' for your next mistake
I put in work, and watch my status escalate

[Verse 1]
Now, I'mma start collectin' props, connectin' plots
Networkin' like a conference, ‘cause the nonsense is yet to stop
Jakes shake me down, haters wanna take me down
Break me down, CLAP! — All they heard was a sound
Yo, I scoped it out, I took your weak dream and choked it out
Your bitch don't really got no ass, she just poked it out
On the D-low, I'm sayin' you versus me though?
We can do this shit right here, in front of your people
See, time is money, kid, and BS walks
And to me it's funny, kid, when you meatheads talk
I see feds stalk, they wanna dig up the dirt, son
Is it me they hawk? ‘Cause I be puttin' in work, son
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah, surprisingly
I've been layin', waitin' for your next mistake
I put in work, and watch my status escalate

[Verse 2]
You cornballs get stonewalled, blackballed, I own y'all
The veteran, runnin' my plan, I'm the better man
Crazy raw, doin' my job like the mob
Blazin' y'all, and disappearin' in the fog
Or a mist, and chicks can't resist what I kick
They be beggin' for attention, or some more of the dillznick
Word up, baby, someone may have to get hurt up, baby
Shit is mad shady, but I got to get the gravy
Platinum respect like the force of a TEC
Keep you hittin' the deck, feelin' heat in your chest
Bangin' your thoughts with the hot onslaught
A kid got shot on the spot for goin' where he should not
Viciously, I make history instantly
Those other lame-ass loser-ass niggas, they can't fuck with me
I'm doin' my thing now to lamp later on
Paid in the shade with some fly gators on
But now I'm grimy as they get, mud on my pants and shirt
I bet you niggas out here know, I be puttin' in work
[Chorus]
I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah, surprisingly
I've been layin', waitin' for your next mistake
I put in work, and watch my status escalate
