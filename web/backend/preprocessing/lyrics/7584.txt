28 ContributorsCan’t Stand Me Now Lyrics[Verse 1: Carl Barat]
An ending fitting for the start
You twisted and tore our love apart
Your light fingers threw the dart
That shattered the lamp and into darkness cast us

[Verse 2: Pete Doherty]
No, you've got it the wrong way round
You shut me up, and blamed it on the brown
Cornered the boy kicked out at the world
The world kicked back a lot fuckin' harder now

[Pre-Chorus: Carl Barat & Pete Doherty]
If you want to try
If you want to try
There's no worse you could do
Uh oh oh

I know you lie
I know you lie
I'm still in love with you
Uh oh oh
Can't take me anywhere
I'd take you anywhere
You can't take me anywhere
Well, I can't take you anywhere
I'll take you anywhere you want to go

Oh, you can't stand me now, no you can't stand me now
No, you can't stand me now, no you can't stand me now
You can't stand me now, no you can't stand me
No, you can't stand me, no you can't stand me now

[Verse 3:]
Have we enough to keep it together?
Or do we just keep on pretending
And hope our luck is never ending now
You tried to pull the wool I wasn't feeling too clever
And you take all that they're lending
Until you needed mending now

[Pre-Chorus: Carl Barat & Pete Doherty]
If you want to try
If you want to try
There's no worse you could do
Uh oh oh

I know you lie
All you do is make me cry
All those words they ain't true

Can't take me anywhere, I can't take you anywhere
Can't take me anywhere, I won't take you anywhere
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
[Chorus: Carl Barat & Pete Doherty]
Oh, you can't stand me now, no you can't stand me now
No, you can't stand me now, no you can't stand me now
No, you can't stand me now, no you can't stand me now
No, you can't stand me now, no you can't stand me now

(Repeat)
No oh oh
You can't stand me now
Oh oh oh8Embed Can't Stand Me Now The Libertines The Libertines garage
