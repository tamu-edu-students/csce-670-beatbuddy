I need you to fill the void
I wonder how I got by this week
I only touched you once
Lately I can't find a beat
I used to feel the rush

[Verse 1]
Started with a little bit
Now I don't know how to quit
Always feel inadequate
Same way that my daddy did
Mama told me not to try
And I should have taken her advice
And now I'm all twisted
When it's all gone, I miss it

[Refrain]
I'll try just to do somethin'
I'll try 'cause I got nothin'
Else that gets me through the day
'Til I find another way
I'll try just to do somethin'
I'll try 'cause I got nothin'
Even if I lose again
I won't quit

I wonder how I got by this week
I only touched you once, uh
Lately I can't find a beat
I used to feel the rush

[Chorus]
And now I need you to feel the vibe
I need you to see the point
I need you to feel alive
I need you to fill the void

[Verse 2]
My insecurities are
My own worst enemy, yeah
Something's not lettin' me
Move the way I used to
Thought you could better me but
Then you stopped lettin' me walk
Now you're just settin' me off
So I'm tryna lose you

[Refrain]
I'll fight just to do somethin'
I'll fight 'cause I got nothin'
Else that gets me through the day
'Til I find another way
I'll fight just to do somethin'
I'll fight 'cause I got nothin'
Even if I lose again
I can't quit, mmm
[Pre-Chorus]
I wonder how I got by this week
I only touched you once
Lately I can't find a beat
I used to feel the rush

[Chorus]
And now I need you to feel the vibe
I need you to see the point
I need you to feel alive
I need you to fill the void
I need you to fill the void
I need you to fill the void
I need you to fill the void
I need you to fill my void

[Outro]
You paralyze me every time
I try to find some Paradise
I've got to fill the void
And now I'm paranoid
You paralyze me every time
I try to find some Paradise
I've got to fill the void
And now I'm paranoid60Embed Void Hard To Imagine The Neighbourhood Ever Changing The Neighbourhood alt-rock
