48 ContributorsDisposable Teens Lyrics[Verse 1]
And I'm a black rainbow, and I'm an ape of god
I've got a face that's made for violence upon
And I'm a teen distortion, survived abortion
A rebel from the waist down

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
I wanna thank you mom, I wanna thank you dad
For bringing this fucking world to a bitter end
I never really hated the one true God
But the God of the people I hated

[Chorus]
You said you wanted evolution
The ape was a great, big hit
You say you want a revolution, man
And I say that you're full of shit

[Post-Chorus]

We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable

The more that you fear us, the bigger we get
The more that you fear us, the bigger we get
And don't be surprised, don't be surprised
Don't be surprised when we destroy all of it
