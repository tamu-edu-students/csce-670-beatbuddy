I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard
For love to ever last

[Verse]
My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still, I fall in love so easily
I fall in love too fast

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still, I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fastYou might also like5Embed
