(Ghostbusters)
If there's something strange
In your neighborhood
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
If there's something weird
And it don't look good
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)

[Chorus]
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost

If you're seeing things
Running through your head
Who can you call?
(Ghostbusters)
An invisible man
Sleepin' in your bed
Ow, who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)

[Chorus]
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost
Uh, I ain't 'fraid of no ghost

And call
