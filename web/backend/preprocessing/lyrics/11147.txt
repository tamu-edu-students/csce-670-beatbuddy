Maybe
Oh, if I could pray and I try, dear
You might come back home, home to me

Maybe
Whoa, if I could ever hold your little hand
Oh you might understand
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah

Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe dear
I guess I might have done something wrong
Honey, I'd be glad to admit it
Oh, come on home to me!
Honey maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe yeah

Well I know that it just doesn't ever seem to matter, baby
Oh honey, when I go out or what I'm trying to do
Can't you see I'm still left here
And I'm holding on in needing you

Please, please, please, please
Oh won't you reconsider babe
Now come on, I said come back
Won't you come back to me

Maybe dear, oh maybe, maybe, maybe
Let me help you show me how
