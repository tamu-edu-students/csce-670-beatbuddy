Tell me what you want, what you like, it's okay
I'm a little curious, too
Tell me if it's wrong, if it's right, I don't care
I can keep a secret, can you?

[Refrain]
Got my mind on your body
And your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry
I just need to take a bite

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer (Ha!)

[Break]
Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus]
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I
We're cool for the summer

[Refrain]
Got my mind on your body
And your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry
I just need to take a bite

Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer (Ha!)
