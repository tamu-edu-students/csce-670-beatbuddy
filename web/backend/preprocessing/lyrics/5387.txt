Well, I was there on the day they sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out, we watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself, but it started with an alright scene

[Verse 1]
It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
It was a lie when they smiled and said, "You won't feel a thing"
And as we ran from the cops, we laughed so hard, it would sting
Yeah, yeah, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

[Verse 2]
I spent my high school career spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine, we'll show 'em what we all mean
Yeah, yeah, woah

If I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter long after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

[Post-Chorus]
So go, go away
Just go, run away
But where did you run to?
And where did you hide?
Go find another way
Price you pay
[Bridge]
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you, come on
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
