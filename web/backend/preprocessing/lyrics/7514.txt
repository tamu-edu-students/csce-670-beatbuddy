Let's go, lose control
Slippy-slide on the dance floor
Let's go, lose control
Slip-Slippy-slide on the d-d-dance floor
Let's go, lose control
Slippy-slide on the dance floor
Let's go, lose control
Three, two, one, drop it

Pass that back to the ganger boys
Let's go, lose control
Slippy-slide on the dance floor
Let's go, lose control
Slip-Slippy-slide on the d-d-dance floor
Let's go, lose control
Slippy-slide on the dance floor
Let's go, lose control
Slippy-slide on the dance floor
