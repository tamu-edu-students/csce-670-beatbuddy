I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess
Now when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

[Refrain 1: Aladdin]
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Refrain 2: Jasmine & Aladdin]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

[Verse 2: Jasmine, Aladdin, Both]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
You might also like[Refrain 3: Jasmine & Aladdin]
A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath, it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[Refrain 4: Aladdin & Jasmine]
A whole new world
Every turn, a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment, red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Refrain 5: Aladdin, Jasmine, Both]
A whole new world
A whole new world
That's where we'll be
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
