My grandpa fought in World War II
He was such a noble dude
I can't even finish school
Missed my mom and left too soon
His dad was a fireman
Who fought fires so violent
I think I bored my therapist
While playing him my violin

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh my god) That's so insane
(Oh my god) That's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad (One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon (That's right, that's right)
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you

My grandpa fought in World War II
And he was such a noble dude
Man, I feel like such a fool
I got so much left to prove
All my friends have vaping friends
They'rе so good at making friends
I'm so scared of caving in
Is that entеrtaining yet?

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh my god) That's so insane
(Oh my god) That's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad (One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon (That's right, that's right)
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you

[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Somewhere in the universe
Somewhere someone's got it worse
Wish that made it easier
Wish I didn't feel the hurt

[Chorus]
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon

[Outro]
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
All up and down a city street
While tryna put my mind at ease
Like finishing this melody
This feels like a necessity
So this could be the death of me
Or maybe just a better me
Now, come in with the timpanis
And take a shot of Hennessy
I know I'm not there mentally
But you could be the remedy
So let me play my violin for you40Embed World's Smallest Violin OK ORCHESTRA AJR rock
