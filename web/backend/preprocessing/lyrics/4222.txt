For awhile, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
In our eyes, we're alive
Deep inside, we knew our love was true
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night, something right
Would invite us to begin the day

[Pre-Chorus]
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

[Chorus]
And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

[Verse 2]
For awhile, to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
'Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love in two

Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
Oh, and yesterday was all we had

[Chorus]
And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?4Embed
