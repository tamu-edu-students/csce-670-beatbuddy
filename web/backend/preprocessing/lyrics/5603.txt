10 ContributorsNever in My Wildest Dreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never in my wildest dreams
Would I be loving you
Never in my wildest dreams
Would my dreams come true
You're just too good to touch
I can't discuss it much
I get too choked up
Don't wanna make a scene
Never in my wildest dreams

[Verse 2]
Never in my wildest dreams
Would I roam this land
Sail across the seven seas
I'm a hard luck man
I know where my purpose is
It ain't on some pilgrimage
It's wherever my baby is
My love supreme
Never in my wildest dreams

[Verse 3]
Walk in the cold, cold wind
Carry my laundry bin
Take my rags for a spin
Watch daytime TV
You're just too good to touch
And I can't discuss it much
I get too choked up
Don't wanna make a scene
Never in my wildest dreamsYou might also likeEmbed Never in My Wildest Dreams Waiting on a Song Dan Auerbach garage
