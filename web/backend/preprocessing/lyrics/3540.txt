22 ContributorsEverybody Loves Somebody Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

[Verse 2]
Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here

[Chorus]
If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms

[Verse 3]
Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

[Chorus]
If I had it in my power
I would arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms
You might also like[Verse 4]
Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

[Outro]
