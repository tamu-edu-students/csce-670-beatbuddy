34 ContributorsI Stay Away Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, hey, I want to travel south this year
Ah, woah, woah... won't prevent safe passage here

[Chorus]
Why you act crazy?
Not an act, maybe
So close, a lady
Shifty eyes, shady

[Verse 2]
Yeah, hey, yeah, tears that soak a callous heart

[Chorus]
Why you act frightened?
I am enlightened
Your weakness builds me
So someday, you'll see

[Bridge]
I stay away

Why you act crazy?
Not an act, maybe
So close, a lady
Shifty eyes, shady

[Bridge]
I stay away
I stay away
I stay away
