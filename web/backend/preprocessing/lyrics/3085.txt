19 ContributorsLessons in Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not proud, I was wrong
And the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard
Lifeboat lies lost at sea
I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

[Chorus 1]
All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

[Verse 2]
For restless eyes, egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard
Heavy hearts, token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand

[Chorus 2]
All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah

Lost without love
Lessons in love
When will you ever learn
Lessons in love
When there's nowhere left to turn
Lessons in love
Don't let your spirit burn
Lessons in love
I'll wait 'till you return

[Chorus 1]
All the dreams that we were building
We never lived them
We could use it, we should use it, yeah (Lessons in love)
Lessons in love

[Chorus 2]
All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah
