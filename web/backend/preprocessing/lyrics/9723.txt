Get-get-get-get, got-got-got-got
Blood rush to my head lit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot

[Verse 1]
Tailpipe draggin', volume blastin', bailin' out my brain
Red light flash, dem stop I smash
Abraxas, hydroplane, massive
Catch this flight flow rainin' madness
Mastered mine and laced
The ave with black cat fish tailin' waves of stratus
Curb right to far left lane
Don't wait for me, if I care
'Bout anything, anywhere
Losin' myself, I get the stares
What I'm lookin' at, wasn't there
Wasn't there, wasn't there
Wasn't there, wasn't there
Nothin' out there, can't stay inside
Hit the bar, sleep-deprived
Who drove the car? I'm still alive
Up in smoke, moon was low
How'd you know, didn't say I did
Whose is this? You know what this is
But do you know?
You might also like[Chorus]
Get-get-get-get, got-got-got-got
Blood rush to my head lit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot
Fly inside out
Rot dem big shot simp slot shit but a one-hit quick stop

[Verse 2]
So many ways to skin the frame
Remember when first got strange
Now I just think it life obey
So what comes next right away
Right away, right away
Right away, right away
Raise the cup, tilt it dry
Come black cloud, cover the sky
Tongue through pupil of your eye
Sickness moves you can't deny
Lickin' through you, mastermind
For mercy, man cry
Yeah, I'm knowin' and you know why
Nail through mental ever dem try
Pigeon hole me get crucified
Can't clone this edge
What's it cost to lose your head
Wit out end up lost
Should be askin' where's the safe
Born with a ski mask on my face
[Chorus]
Get-get-get-get, got-got-got-got
Blood rush to my head lit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot
Uh, yeah

[Verse 3]
Lycanthropic manic cycles
Fire water, burnin' bibles
Wake up ragin', call a taxi
Take me to the nearest city
Cell light up, yeah get at me
Make it quick though, blood, I'm busy
Get busy, get busy, get busy, get busy
Drilled a hole into my head
Pierced the bone and felt the breeze
Lift my thoughts out dem sick bed
Wit a pair of crow skeleton wings
Know nothin' since then it seems
Been floatin' through the nexus threadin' dreams
But did you know?
Yo

[Chorus]
Get-get-get-get, got-got-got-got
Blood rush to my head lit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot
Get-get-get-get, got-got-got-got
Blood rush to my head lit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot132Embed Get Got The Money Store Death Grips industrial
