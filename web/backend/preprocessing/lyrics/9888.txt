28 ContributorsHeading Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was so insatiable
'Til the lights came on and the stories got old
Now there's no one here, I know
And the city outside's not the same anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I, I remember when we were young
We'd write our names in the sand
So carelessly
Then the rain came and yours was gone
And now mine it stands alone

[Chorus]
Nobody sees me, now I'm a one man show
I'll do this on my own
We knew it all then now this is all I know
Guess I'm heading home now
Guess I'm heading home now
Guess I'm heading home now

[Verse 2]
When the music always played
With the sound of our lives and the sweetest escape
And the neighbors would complain
We would turn it up louder, who cares anyway?

'Cause we, we remembered that we were young
Our lives, were grains in the sand
That we, made our castles and kingdoms of
Now the waves have torn them down

[Chorus]
Nobody sees me, now I'm a one man show
Guess I'm heading home now
Guess I'm heading home now

[Bridge]
You’ll find me
I’ll be here
I can't see
I can’t breathe, anymore
But how could we have stayed?
You were high on love, I was drunk
Drunk on the pain

Guess I'm heading, I'm heading, I'm heading
I'm heading home
Guess I'm heading home now5Embed
