[Verse 1: Sam Smith & Jenna G]
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down ('Nother)
You, you enchant me even when you're not around ('Nother)
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down ('Nother)
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found ('Nother)

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith & Jenna G]
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

[Chorus: Sam Smith, Jenna G]
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you ('Nother)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you ('Nother)
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you ('Nother)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you ('Nother)
