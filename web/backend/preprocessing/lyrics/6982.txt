(Murder, murder, murder…)
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down

[Verse 1]
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
About your kind
And so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so
I'll have to play

[Pre-Chorus]
If you think you're getting away, I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way, boy, just come along
Hear me when I say, hey

[Chorus]
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove, hey-hey, hey-hey
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down

[Verse 2]
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know there may be others
And so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so
You'll just have to pray
