(I'm sorry that I fucked up)
(I’m sorry that I fucked up)
(I'm sorry that I fucked up)
(I'm sorry that I fucked up)
Ay, ay

[Chorus]
I’m sorry that I fucked up
Now we go through it again
Where I gain another pain
And I lose another friend
I fucked up
It's getting hard to stand
And I missed another plane
'Cause I took another Xan
I'm fucked up
'Cause of all the things I say
I don't mean it
But I think that I'ma say it anyway
I'm fucked up
I don’t think I can be saved
If I ever get redemption, it’ll be inside the grave
I fucked up
I fucked up
I fucked up
I fucked up
Yeah, I fucked up
I fucked up
I fucked up
I fucked up
Yeah

22 chains (Migos)
Tried to change
Take away the pain (Take away the pain)
Made it out the motherfucking block on my own two
Tried to hit me up when I'm up, I don’t know you
And all the memories I have
The things I've buried in the past (Buried in the past)
Moments I cannot get back, still can't forget you (I can't forget you)
And when the tears fell down your face
And all the words I can’t erase
All the highs
I try to chase, still can't forget you (I can't forget you)

[Chorus]
I'm sorry that I fucked up
Now we go through it again
Where I gain another pain
And I lose another friend
I fucked up
It's getting hard to stand
And I missed another plane
'Cause I took another Xan
I'm fucked up
'Cause of all the things I say
I don't mean it
But I think that I'ma say it anyway
I'm fucked up
I don't think I can be saved
If I ever get redemption, it'll be inside the grave
I fucked up
I fucked up
I fucked up
I fucked up
Yeah, I fucked up
I fucked up
I fucked up
I fucked up
Yeah
[Outro]
