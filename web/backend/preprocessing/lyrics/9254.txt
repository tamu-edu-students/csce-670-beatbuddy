Hey, ah-na-na, innocence is over
Hey, ah-na-na, over
Hey, ah-na-na, ignorance is spoken
Hey, ah-na-na, spoken
Hey, ah-na-na, confidence is broken
Hey, ah-na-na, broken
Hey, ah-na-na, sustenance is stolen
Hey, ah-na-na, stolen
Hey, ah-na-na, arrogance is potent
Hey, ah-na-na, potent, yeah

[Chorus]
What I see is unreal
I've written my own part
Eat of the apple, so young
I'm crawling back to start

[Verse 2]
Hey, ah-na-na, I repent tomorrow
Hey, ah-na-na, tomorrow
Hey, ah-na-na, I suspend my sorrow
Hey, ah-na-na, sorrow, yeah

[Chorus]
What I see is unreal
I've written my own part
Eat of the apple, so young
I'm crawlin' back to start

Hey, ah-na-na, a romance is fallen
Hey, ah-na-na, fallen
Hey, ah-na-na, recommend you borrow

What I see is unreal
I've written my own part
Eat of the apple, so young
I'm crawlin' back to start
