Looking up from underneath
Fractured moonlight on the sea
Reflections still look the same to me
As before I went under
And it's peaceful in the deep
Cathedral where you cannot breathe
No need to pray, no need to speak
Now I am under all

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go

[Chorus]
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

[Verse 2]
Though the pressure's hard to take
It's the only way I can escape
It seems a heavy choice to make
And now I am under, oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the seabed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go

[Chorus]
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

[Bridge]
And it's over and I'm going under
But I'm not giving up, I'm just giving in
I'm slipping underneath
So, so cold and so sweet
And the arms of the ocean, so sweet and so cold
And all this devotion I never knew at all
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner released
And the arms of the ocean delivered me

[Outro]
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Delivered me
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go (Delivered me)
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go (Delivered me)
Never let me go, never let me go
And it's over and I'm going under
But I'm not giving up, I'm just giving in
I'm slipping underneath
So cold and so sweet42Embed
