Where we are (Where we are)
I don't know where we are (Where we are)
But it will be okay
Where we are (Where we are)
I don't know where we are (Where we are)
But it will be okay

[Verse 1]
Laying on a table like I wasn't even there
Holding on a steering wheel and coming up for air
What was that?
Driving in the rain, what was that?
Calling out your name

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling fan, feeling far away
Leaning on the reasons like it wasn't even fair
What was that?
Driving in the rain, what was that?
Calling out your name

[Chorus]
Where we are
I don't know where we are
But it will be okay
Where we are
I don't know where we are
But it will be okay

Crashed the car in Arizona, on the interstate
People pulling over, crying, thinking we were dead
What was that?
Driving in the rain, what was that?
Calling out your name

[Bridge]
I know who you wanted me to be
Always holding up your tragedy

[Chorus]
Where we are
I don't know where we are
But it will be okay
Where we are (Where we are)
I don't know where we are (Where we are)
But it will be okay
Where we are (Where we are)
I don't know where we are (Where we are)
But it will be okay
Where we are (Where we are)
I don't know where we are (Where we are)
But it will be okay
Where we are (Where we are)
I don't know where we are (Where we are)
But it will be okay (Okay)
Where we are (Where we are)
I don't know where we are (Where we are)
But it will be okay
Where we are
I don't know where we are
But it will be okayEmbed
