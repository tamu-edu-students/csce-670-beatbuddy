34 ContributorsDecember, 1963 (Oh, What a Night) Lyrics[Verse 1: Gerry Polci]
Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

[Verse 2: Gerry Polci]
Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

[Chorus: Frankie Valli]
Oh, I, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

[Verse 3: Gerry Polci]
(Oh, what a night)
Hypnotizing, mesmerizin' me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

[Bridge: Don Ciccone]
And I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under
(Oh, what a night)

Oh, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

[Verse 4: Gerry Polci]
(Oh, what a night)
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

[Bridge: Don Ciccone]
Oh, I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under

[Outro: Gerry Polci, Frankie Valli, Don Ciccone]
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do...11Embed December, 1963 (Oh What a Night!) Who Loves You Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons r-n-b
