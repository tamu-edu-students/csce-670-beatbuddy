We brood in a land that is struck by disease
A visage so vivid I see, but it's just so unreal
I mourn for the fallen demons, leviathan carries my will
Confounded, yet I am immortal, the ultimate torment I feel

[Chorus: All & Elize Ryd]
Archangel rise, the trinity has synchronized
A remedy for humankind (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Archangel has fallen down
Against the odds we bring a bloodless sacrifice
From hell on earth to paradise (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Archangel has fallen down

[Verse 2: Mikael Sehlin & Elize Ryd]
See a red moon rise up, an omen of grief
The son of the morning descends from Elysium's creed
I sing for the fallen angels, I carry them under my wings
I'm frozen but still undefeated, for the abandoned I sing

[Chorus: All & Elize Ryd]
Archangel rise, the trinity has synchronized
A remedy for humankind (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Archangel has fallen down
Against the odds we bring a bloodless sacrifice
From hell on earth to paradise (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Archangel has fallen down

[Chorus: All & Elize Ryd]
Archangel rise, the trinity has synchronized
A remedy for humankind (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
