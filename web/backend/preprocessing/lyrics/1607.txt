Pave me a path to follow
And I'll tread any dangerous road
I will beg and I'll steal, I will borrow
If I can make, if I can make your heart my home
Throw me to the water
I don't care how deep or shallow
Because my heart can pound like thunder
And your love, and your love can set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I have promised I will love you 'til the end of time
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and divine
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme
All I want is for you to be mine, mine

[Chorus]
So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it

[Post-Chorus]
Can I get it?

You tease me with your control
Because I long to live under your spell
And without your love, I'm hollow
I won't make it, I won't make it on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
I have promised I will love you 'til the end of time (End of time)
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly and divine (So divine)
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme (Mmm)
All I want is for you to be mine, mine

[Chorus]
So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it

[Post-Chorus]
Can I get it?

[Bridge]
When will you run with me?
Like I know you wanna
(Like you want to, like you want)
You're the one for me
And I'm countin' on you (On you)
To put the pieces of me back together
[Chorus]
So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Mmm)
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it9Embed
