28 ContributorsTurning Page Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've waited a hundred years
But I'd wait a million more for you
Nothing prepared me for
What the privilege of being yours would do

[Verse 2]
If I had only felt the warmth within your touch
If I had only seen how you smile when you blush
Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough
Well I would have known
What I was living for all along
What I've been living for

[Chorus]
Your love is my turning page
Where only the sweetest words remain
Every kiss is a cursive line
Every touch is a redefining phrase

[Verse 3]
I surrender who I've been for who you are
For nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours
Well I would have known
What I've been living for all along
What I've been living for

Though we're tethered to the story we must tell
When I saw you, well I knew we'd tell it well
With a whisper we will tame the vicious seas
Like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees18Embed Turning Page Turning Page Sleeping At Last ambient
