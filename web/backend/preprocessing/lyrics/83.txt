He don't love me no more
He don't love, he don't love me no more

[Verse 1]
Evergreen, he controls me
Was there something wrong with my body?
Am I not what you wanted, babe?
If I ever tried, If I ever tried
I would

[Chorus]
Evergreen, he tears me to pieces
(Evergreen) Doesn't even have to try

[Verse 2]
She don't know you like me
She could never love you more
More than me
But sometimes I pray that you fall in love
I've cried, I've cried so much
For you, baby

[Chorus]
Evergreen, he tears me to pieces
(Evergreen) Doesn't even have to try (Evergreen)

You know you really made me hate myself
Had to stop before I break myself
Shoulda broke it off to date myself
You didn't deserve me at all, at all, at all
One last time
I see, Ever, Evergreen
Please don't come home to me
Sweet Evergreen
He don't love me no more

[Outro]
He don't love me no more
He don't love, he don't love me no more5Embed
