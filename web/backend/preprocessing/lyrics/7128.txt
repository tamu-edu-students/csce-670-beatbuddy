And if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to lose
And if you wouldn't care I would like to leave
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe

[Chorus]
Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame

And if you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe

[Chorus]
Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame
Yeah!
