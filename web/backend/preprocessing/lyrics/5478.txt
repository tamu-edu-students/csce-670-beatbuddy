This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your metal on (Ooh), we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
'Til God strikes us
That's a pretty fuckin' fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the 5
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fuckin', underneath moonlight now
Pretty fuckin', sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur, hey)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, haze, wait)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on a speed boat?
We smell of Californication (Strike a pose)
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows (Ooh)
Can you come when I call again?

[Verse 2]
On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
Piece in my hand worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away
Because I'm stronger and the Congo is dim (Smoke)
In comes the morning, ah (Smoke)
In comes the morning, ah (Haze)You might also like61Embed Skyline To Blonde Frank Ocean soul
