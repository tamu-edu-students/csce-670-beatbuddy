3 ContributorsHigh Note Lyrics[Intro]
(We got a vibe, yeah)
(We got this vibe for you)
(Oh, we got a vibe)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
It's a little hard, sometimes
To rest, unwind
Holla if you're here because
You want to leave your stress behind

Getting into overload
Don't lose your flow
Holla if you're here because
You wanna bury your sorrow in a vibe

[Pre-Chorus]
In a vibe, honey
All of your troubles don't seem so amplified
'Cause inside, worry
Can take you over, deplete your appetitе

Got a vibe, honey
We got thе specialist beat, secret supply
We put it down, down, and they'll be telling us
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, Yeah
Spin another vibe, bro
Wheel it, then light up

When the night ends
You'll be leaving on a High Note
Get out here hyper

Yeah, Yeah
Spin another vibe, bro
Wheel it, then light up

When the night ends
You'll be leaving on a High Note
Get out here, get out here

(And you'll be singing ah-ya-ya-ya)
You'll be singing 'Ah-yah' in no time

(Like I don't wanna go-ya-ya-ya)
Like I don't wanna go, go, go home

(And you'll be singing ah-ya-ya-ya)
You'll be singing ah-ya-ya-ya
Ah-ya-ya-ya
(Like I don't wanna go-ya-yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's a little hard, sometimes
To fill the quiet
Holla if you're settling
We'll let it spin, we're never tired

Getting into overload
Don't lose your flow
Holla if you're here because
You wanted us to take control with a vibe

[Pre-Chorus]
With a vibe, honey
All of your troubles don't seem so amplified
'Cause inside, worry
Can take you over, deplete your appetite

Got a vibe, honey
We got the specialist beat, secret supply
We put it down, down, and they'll be telling us

[Chorus]
Yeah, Yeah
Spin another vibe, bro
Wheel it, then light up
When the night ends
You'll be leaving on a High Note
Get out here hyper

Yeah, Yeah
Spin another vibe, bro
Wheel it, then light up

When the night ends
You'll be leaving on a High Note
Get out here, get out here

[Outro]
(Get out he-ere)
(Wo-oah)
You'll be singing ay-yah in not time
Yeah, like 'I don't wanna go, go, go home'
You'll be singing ah-ya-ya-ya-yeah....
Ah-ya-ya-ya-yeah

I don't wanna go home
(Cause inside...)
Control the vibeEmbed
