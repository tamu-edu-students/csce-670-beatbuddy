6 ContributorsI Feel Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
Livin' life in color
Everything around me looks so beautiful and sweet
Heavenly desire
Everything's so bright, it's like a brand new movie scene

[Pre-Chorus]
All the immersive colors
Picture perfect
Vibrant gainless paradise
And the world keeps goin' 'round

[Chorus]
I feel good
When there's a million stars in the sky
I feel good
When the sun is shining so bright
I feel good, yeah
When the world keeps goin' 'round
Goin' 'round
I feel good

[Verse 2]
Life is clearer than I've ever seen
Feels like I've got magic inside me
Thе world is lightin' up, lightin' up, ooh
All in, all in
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
All the immersive (Around mе) colors (Colors)
Picture perfect (Oh)
Vibrant gainless paradise (It feels so)
And the world keeps goin' 'round

[Chorus]
I feel good
When there's a million stars in the sky
I feel good
When the sun is shining so bright
I feel good, yeah
When the world keeps goin' 'round
Goin' 'round
I feel goodEmbed
