Such a lonely day and it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life
Such a lonely day should be banned
It's a day that I can't stand

[Chorus: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

[Verse 2: Daron Malakian]
Such a lonely day shouldn't exist
It's a day that I'll never miss
Such a lonely day and it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life

[Bridge: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
And if you go, I wanna go with you
And if you die, I wanna die with you
Take your hand and walk away

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
