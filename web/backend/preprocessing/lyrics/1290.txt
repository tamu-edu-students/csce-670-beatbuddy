What's with these homies dissin' my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?

[Pre-Chorus]
Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, and that's for all of time

[Chorus]
Ooh wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that

[Verse 2]
Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a guardian

[Pre-Chorus]
Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, and that's for all of time

Ooh wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that

[Bridge]
Bang, bang, knocking on the door
Another big bang, get down on the floor
Oh no, what do we do?
Don't look now, but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' sick?
What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' blue? Oh-oh
[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's for all of time
And that's for all of time

[Chorus]
Ooh wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that43Embed
