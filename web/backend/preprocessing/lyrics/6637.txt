57 ContributorsI Just Had Sex Lyrics[Intro: Andy Samberg & Akon]
Sometimes
Oh, oh, oh
Something beautiful happens in this world
Akon
You don't know how to express yourself, so
And Lonely Island, yeah
You just gotta sing

[Chorus: Akon]
I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I just had sex, and I'll never go back (Never go back)
To the not-having-sex ways of the past

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone & Akon]
Have you ever had sex? I have, it felt great (Yeah)
It felt so good when I did it with my penis (Yeah)
A girl let me do it, it literally just happened (Oh)
Having sex can make a nice man out the meanest
Never guess where I just came from, I had sex
If I had to describe the feeling, it was the best
When I had the sex, man, my penis felt great
And I called my parents right after I was done
Oh, hey, didn't see you there, guess what I just did?
Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest
Was sure nice of her to let you do that thing
Nice of any girl ever! Now, sing
You might also like[Chorus: Akon]
I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I wanna tell the world

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone & Akon]
To be honest, I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it
Doesn't really make sense! But, man, screw it
I ain't one to argue with a good thing! She could be my wife
That good? The best thirty seconds of my life (My life)
I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her
'Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure (Manure)
With that in mind, a soft, nice-smelling girl's better
Plus, she let me wear my chain and my turtleneck sweater

[Bridge: Akon]
So this one's dedicated to them girls
That let us flop around on top of them (Yeah)
Whether you're near or far, whether short or tall (Yeah)
We wanna thank you all for letting us fuck you

[Interlude: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, & Akon]
She kept looking at her watch
Doesn't matter, had sex
But I cried the whole time
Doesn't matter, had sex
I think she might've been a racist
Doesn't matter, had sex
She put a bag on my head
Still counts!
[Bridge: Akon]
I just had sex (Sex), and my dreams came true (Dreams came true)
So if you've had sex in the last thirty minutes
Then you qualified to sing with me

[Chorus: Akon, Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
I just had sex (Everybody sing), and it felt so good (We all had sex) (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her (I wanna tell the world)
I just had sex (I just had sex), and I'll never go back (I just had sex) (Never go back) (No no no)
To the not-having-sex ways of the past
(Sex has gotta be so great)15Embed
