I don't wanna play this ping-pong
I would rather film a TikTok
Your mom raised you as a prince
But this is queendom, right?
I like dancing, I love my friends
Sometimes we swear without cigarettes
I like to "eh" on drinking whiskey
I won't change it, what the hell?

[Pre-Chorus: Shuhua, Miyeon, Soyeon]
미친 척이라 말해, what's the loss to me? Yeah
사정없이 씹으라고, you're lost to me, yeah (To me, yeah)
사랑 그깟 거 따위 내 눈에 눈물 한 방울 어림없지
너의 하찮은 말에 미소나 지을 바엔
