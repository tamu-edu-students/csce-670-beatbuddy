Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come followin' you

[Verse]
Take me for a trip upon your magic swirling ship
All my senses have been stripped
And my hands can't feel to grip
And my toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'

I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Unto my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

[Chorus]
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come followin' youYou might also likeEmbed Mr. Tambourine Man Mr. Tambourine Man The Byrds psych-rock
