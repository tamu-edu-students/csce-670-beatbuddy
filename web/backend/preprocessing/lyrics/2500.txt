69 ContributorsFrom Now On Lyrics[Verse 1: Hugh Jackman]
I saw the sun begin to dim
And felt that winter wind blow cold
A man learns who is there for him
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
'Cause from then, rubble, one remains
Can only be what's true
If all was lost, there's more I gained
'Cause it led me back to you

[Chorus: Hugh Jackman]
From now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight, tonight
Let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on

[Verse 2: Hugh Jackman]
I drank champagne with kings and queens
The politicians praised my name
But those were someone else's dreams
The pitfalls of the man I became
For years and years, I chased their cheers
A crazy speed of always needin' more
But when I stop and see you here
I remember who all this was for
You might also like[Chorus]
And from now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight, it starts tonight
And let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on
From now on

[Refrain: Ensemble, Hugh Jackman]
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again (From now on)
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again
And we will come back home (From now on)
And we will come back home (From now on)
Home again
And we will come back home (From now on)
And we will come back home (From now on, yes)
Home again
And we will come back home (From now on)
And we will come back home (From now on)
Home again
[Chorus: Hugh Jackman, Ensemble]
From now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight, it starts tonight
Let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on
From now on

[Refrain: Ensemble]
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again
