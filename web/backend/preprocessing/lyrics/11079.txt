I remember I had walked home that day, content with all my misery
Told myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather, but the summer rays were kissin' me
I, I was lost

[Verse 1]
So I took a different path; in the distance, he awaited me
Had no weapon, I'm guessin' his hands were just enough for me
Was no question, I'm guessin' he laughed just at the sight of me
I was lost

[Chorus]
I remember I had walked home that day, content with all my misery
Told myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather, but the summer rays were kissin' me
I, I was lost

[Verse 2]
And there he was, his presence was alarming
As he approached, was casual, we talked 'bout self-harmin'
He told me, "Kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own"

[Verse 3]
You ever woke up on a train track with no motherfuckin' clothes on?
Death before your eyes, you prayin' to God, but ain't no response
Tryna scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on
But ain't nobody comin', so you scream on and scream on and scream on
While this evil fuck laugh at you
Train gettin' closer, you still surprised that he battered you
Tears fallin' harder and harder, minutes get minuscule
Coulda had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?
You finna die here on this train track
'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back
Thinkin' 'bout your previous memories, goin' way back
All them fuckin' dreams 'bout a diamond chain and a Maybach
Now your time finally up
Ask yourself this final question, is you goin' down or up?
Recollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck
Now it's here, death has now arrived, time's finally up137Embed Train food SKINS XXXTENTACION emo
