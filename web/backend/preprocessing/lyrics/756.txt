Don't hold my hand, don't beg me back
Don't say that we'll make it through this
If I'm so beautiful, then why?
The doors we slammed, the plates we smashed
Echo with the sound of madness
I can't remember why we try

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo]
My heart only wants you
The moment you say no

[Chorus: Lisa, Jisoo, Jennie]
But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it doesn't matter
Tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop thе tears if I want to
But tonight, I'll be the happiеst girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

[Verse 2: Rosé, Lisa]
Don't make us saints, we're wards of pain
The past and a perfect picture
There's no one else to blame this time
Don't change the truth, we can't undo
The high we chase, steal the crash, no
You're not the one who gets to cry
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo]
My heart only wants you
The moment you say no

[Chorus: Jennie, Jisoo, Rosé]
But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it doesn't matter
Tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

[Bridge: Lisa, Jisoo]
All it takes is a smooth pop of a bottle top
To fix a heart, a broken heart, baby
All it takes is a little rollin' paper
Take us to the start, go back to the start

[Chorus: Rosé, Jisoo, Jennie]
But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it doesn't matter
Tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
But tonight, I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened37Embed
