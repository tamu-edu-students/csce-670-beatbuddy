I etched the face of a stopwatch on the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass
I heard an unhappy ending, it sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning

[Chorus]
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
And the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

[Verse 2]
Mysteries flashing amber go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire never changes
I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning

[Chorus]
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
And the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
You might also like[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
