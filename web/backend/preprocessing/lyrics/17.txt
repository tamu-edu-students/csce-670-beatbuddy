Hypersonic, sex erotic
On my body, boy, you got it
Hit them 'draulics while I ride it
Got me actin' hella thotty
So excited, so exotic
I'm a seasoned professional
Squeeze it, don't let it go
Tease it, no self-control
I got time today (I got time today, I got time)
Oh, I (I got time today, I got time)
I can't wait to come out and play
Ooh, yeah, you
Come and cuff it, cuff it, cuff it, cuff it, baby
While I buss it, buss it, buss it for you, baby
Oh, baby
Anywhere, anytime
I don't mind, I don't mind

Yeah (I don't mind)
For you (All for you)
I'm backin' the truck up, huh (Back that truck up)
For you (All for you, for you)

For you (All for you, you)
