My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
