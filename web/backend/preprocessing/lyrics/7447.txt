12 ContributorsShen Yeng Anthem Lyrics[Intro]
No gyal cyaan see mi and cause problem
Dem a man clown so mi walk 'pon dem
Mi no love chat, but mi a warn dem
Tell dem this a real ShenYeng Anthem
No gyal cyaan see mi and start problem
Dem a man clown so mi walk 'pon dem
Mi no love chat, but mi a warn dem
Tell dem this a real ShenYeng Anthem

[Chorus]
Nah fight no gyal over no man, mi no idiot
If mi a tek your man, mi a keep that
Dem haffi see mi inna street
And pass and whisper to friend if a she that
If a gyal touch mi, mi nah say mi nah beat that
But if mi a tek your man, mi a keep that
She haffi see mi inna street
And pass and whisper to friend if a she that

[Verse 1]
Mi big bad and brave so mi beat mi chest
No gyal cyaan see mi and try tek set
The bitch would a sick so bring her to the vet
ShenYeng stamp S inna chest when mi step
No fight over man, mi no stress over yute
Some gyal head full a air like parachute
When mi and him 'par everybody say we cute
She turn a navigator and take another route
You might also like[Chorus]
Nah fight no gyal over no man, mi no idiot
If me a tek Jordan, me a keep that
She haffi see mi inna street
And pass and whisper to friend if a she that
If a gyal touch mi, mi nah say me nah beat that
But if mi tek your man, mi a keep that
She haffi see mi inna street
And pass and whisper to friend if a she that

[Verse 2]
When cocky good, baby, you haffi share it
But mi no care once mi a him favourite
Mi good pussy shift cocky and tear it
Send him a your yard after so you repair it
Cyaan say a yearn, but 'fraid fi declare it
That mean say a no your own den
If mi a thief man mi no borrow or lend
Mi lock that up like a bull inna mi pen

[Chorus]
Nah fight no gyal over man, mi no idiot
If mi a tek your man, mi a keep that
Dem haffi see mi inna street
And pass and whisper to friend if a she that
If a gyal touch mi, mi nah say me nah beat that
But if mi a tek your man, mi a keep that
She haffi see mi inna street
And pass and whisper to friend if a she that
