Don't get emotional, that ain't like you
Yesterday's still leaking through the roof
That's nothing new
I know I promised this is what I wouldn't do
Somehow giving it the old romantic fool
Seems to better suit the mood

[Chorus]
So if you wanna walk me to the car
You oughta know I'll have a heavy heart
So can we please be absolutely sure
That there's a mirrorball?

[Verse 2]
You're getting cynical and that won't do
I'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view
Darling, if I were you
And how's that insatiable appetite?
For the moment whеn you look them in the eyеs
And say, "Baby, it's been nice"

[Chorus]
So do you wanna walk me to the car?
I'm sure to have a heavy heart
So can we please be absolutely sure
That there's a mirrorball for me?
Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for meYou might also like24Embed
