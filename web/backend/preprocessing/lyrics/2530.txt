I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
'Cause then all of those nights
They would just be all for nothing

[Verse 1]
Third of October, we were never sober
First few times that we hung out
But we fell in love somehow
First time that I met you
I didn't have a damn clue
That I love everything about you
Now I can't think of life without you

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ehh) Did you know that you're my whole heart?
(Ehh) Did you know that I never stop, no
Giving you everything I got ‘cause I'm so

[Chorus]
I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
'Cause then all of those nights
They would just be all for nothing
Yeah, I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
'Cause then all of those nights
They would just be all for nothing

Now that I know that, now that I know

When you cry baby I'll be there, oh

(Ehh) Did you know that you're my whole heart?
(Ehh) Did you know that I never stop, no
Giving you everything I got 'cause I'm so

I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on

They would just be all for nothing
