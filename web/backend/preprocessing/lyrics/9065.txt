Just let it go, don't wanna argue anymore
I can't be sure, I know just what we're fightin' for
I know you're scared and that you're thinkin' I may go
I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard, it seems we've worked at this so long
It's often foolish pride that tells us we're not wrong
I hear your voice, you tell me that you'll never go
And I believe it, I believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question
You might also like[Chorus]
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And we can keep this goin' on
We'll make it work some way
And every step, it makes us
Stronger every day

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true? (What if I was nothin'?)
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you (What if I was nothin')
So what if I was angry? (What if I was nothin') What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you12Embed
