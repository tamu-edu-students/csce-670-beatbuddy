My God, I'm so lonely, so I open the window
To hear sounds of people, to hear sounds of people
Venus, planet of love, was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much too? Did its people want too much?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want your pity, I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward, I just want to feel alright
And I know no one will save me, I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss and I'll be alright

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody

[Verse 2]
I've been big and small and big and small and big and small again
And still nobody wants me, still nobody wants me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know no one will save me, I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss and I'll be alright

[Bridge]
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
