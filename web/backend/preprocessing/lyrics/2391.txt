Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train
New York City, it rains
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
[Verse 2]
Mind over matter
I'm in tatters thinkin' about her
Taste my disaster
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow
Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time
You might also like[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
(I missed that train)
New York City, it rains
(Fly to East L.A.) in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
(All the lights aglow)
Tokyo snows
(Go to watch the show)
Curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

[Bridge]
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
You know you're on my mind
[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
(I missed that train) And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
(Fly to East L.A.)
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
And if the world don't break
(All the lights aglow)
(Tokyo snows)
(Go to watch the show)
(Curtain's closed)
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall27Embed
