21 ContributorsNever Say Never Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without and just hold the smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of, together all the while

[Pre-Chorus]
You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time and time again
Younger now than we were before

[Chorus]
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Picture, you're the queen of everything
Far as the eye can see under your command
I will be your guardian when all is crumbling
I'll steady your hand

You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time, time, and time again
Younger now than we were before

[Chorus]
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

[Bridge]
We're pulling apart and coming together again and again
We're growing apart, but we pull it together
Pull it together, together again

[Chorus]
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go20Embed Never Say Never The Fray The Fray piano
