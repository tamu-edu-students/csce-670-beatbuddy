A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
