18 ContributorsNothing In My Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
A turning tide
Lovers at a great divide
Why do you laugh
When I know that you're hurt inside?

[Chorus]
And why'd you say
It's just another day, nothing in my way
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna stay
So there's nothing left to say?
And why'd you lie
When you wanna die, when you hurt inside
Don't know what you lie for anyway
Now there's nothing left to say

[Verse 2]
A tell-tale sign
You don't know where to draw the line

[Chorus]
And why'd you say
It's just another day, nothing in my way
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna stay
So there's nothing left to say
And why'd you lie
When you wanna die, when you hurt inside
Don't know what you lie for anyway
Now there's nothing left to say

Well, for a lonely soul
You're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul
You're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul, it seems to me
That you're having such a nice time
You're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul
You're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul
You're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul, it seems to me
That you're having such a nice time
You're having such a nice time11Embed Nothing In My Way Under The Iron Sea Keane piano
