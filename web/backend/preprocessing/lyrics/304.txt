Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn & All]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry & All]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

[Verse 2: Niall & Liam]
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on so tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry, All]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

[Bridge: Zayn]
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you
Is like chasing the clouds

[Breakdown: Niall]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen

[Chorus: All & Zayn]
The story of my life, I give her hope (I give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke inside ('Til she's broke inside)
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)
[Outro: All & Harry]
The story of my life
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)
