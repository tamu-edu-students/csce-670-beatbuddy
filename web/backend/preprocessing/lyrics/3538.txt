1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1: Tom Misch]
I love the way it flows
I love the way it grows
There’s something in this sound that takes me far
It’s like a special song
Can move my mood along
But I cannot say you’ll hear through my guitar

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tom Misch]
She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me that the groove is mine
It will take us through the night
And where I’ll go
Can’t explain I’ll never know
But it’s beautiful

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
You can’t take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can’t take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You might also like[Verse 2: Tom Misch]
I love the way it sings
All the joy that it brings
Remember skating down the road towards the park?
I can never say no
You with that summer glow
The music gives me sun when winter starts

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tom Misch]
She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me that the beat is mine
It will rock us through the night
And where I’ll go
Can’t explain I’ll never know
But it’s beautiful

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
You can’t take this away from me (Oh)
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can’t take this away from me (Oh)
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
[Bridge: Tom Misch &  Posdnuos]
You can’t take this away from me (Oh)
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can’t take this away from me (Oh)
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me

[Verse 3: Posdnuos]
Yo, I wear notes like coats
Blues like doos, warm from the rhythm, soul that glues
That bounce to my bones, that jazz in my spine
The hop is my home, rap is my grind
I'm grindin' on the backside of life, we dance
She threw me a chance, her hands in my pants
Actually, my pockets holdin' me tight
Whispering a dream I could hold in the night
Blood tight, a rhythm that's throbbin' my veins
Wake up and write it on a pad, the pains
Like church, the organ will invite the tears
Like birth, I'm cryin', let you know I'm here
Held by the song that gave me a name
Dressed by the verse that gave me a claim
(There’s just a bass in the line) safe to inhale
And if you live well
Belonger years in this state, you will be
A timeless octave to play for the tree
That’s rooted in every single nerve in me
The nerve of he who ignores the key
And use it to open the minds that be free
Whenever you're hot head ignores you, you are free
Beneath the clouds, you allowed to see, in clarity
Through harmony, someone harmin’ me?
That won't be done
I stand protected by the laws of fun
I am perfected through the rhymes of Run
Walkin' this way and leave the party stunned
This music, it launched me
With no aim, I've landed with some plane
Where I am I can't explain or never know
But it's beautiful so...
[Chorus: Tom Misch & Posdnuos]
You can’t take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me (C'mon y'all)
You can’t take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me12Embed
