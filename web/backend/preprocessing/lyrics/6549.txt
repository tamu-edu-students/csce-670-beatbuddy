36 ContributorsBigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's always somebody taller with more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he’s fit
And you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
Wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there

[Pre-Chorus]
They've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in

[Chorus]
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I know you were though

[Verse 2]
Now you don't know what she's up to, you can only assume
If she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
Bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that’s what he likes
I know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

[Pre-Chorus]
But she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
She’s looking at you funny, rarely looking at you twice
You might also like[Chorus]
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but it's clear you were though

[Verse 3]
Have you heard what she has been doing? Never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gate at twenty past three
She’s been with all of the boys but never went very far
And she wagged English and Science just to go in his car

[Pre-Chorus]
They've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched me bird and he'd probably kick my head in
Oh, now the girls have grown
Yeah, but I'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways

[Chorus]
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, I'm better off without her anyway
I said I wasn’t sad to see her go
Yeah, but I’m only pretending, you know
Yeah, I’m only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know6Embed Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor Arctic Monkeys garage
