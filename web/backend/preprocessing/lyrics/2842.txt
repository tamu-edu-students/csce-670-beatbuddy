12 ContributorsAddicted Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me

[Verse 1]
Ooh, girl, let's take it slow
So as for you, well, you know where to go
I wanna take my love and hate you 'til the end

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not like you to turn away
From all the bullshit I can't take
It's not like me to walk away

[Chorus]
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me
Yeah
You might also like[Verse 2]
I know when it's getting rough
All the times we spend
Tryna make this love
Something better than
Just making up again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not like you to turn away
All the bullshit I can't take
Just when I think I can walk away

[Chorus]
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
I'm so addicted to
The things you do
When you're going down on me
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me, yeah
When you're loving me
[Bridge]
How can I make it through
All the things you do
There's just gotta be more to you and me

[Chorus]
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
It's unlike anything
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything

[Outro]
I'm so addicted to you
