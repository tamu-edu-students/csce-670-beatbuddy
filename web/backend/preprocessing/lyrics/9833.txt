10 ContributorsSmoke Detector Lyrics[Chorus]
Smoke detector, smoke detector
All you need to do is protect her
Smoke detector
Smoke detector, smoke detector
Blink and bless her and let her rest
Don't let my memory dissolve

[Verse 1]
Make a list of your loved ones in order of height
Laugh at the blackbirds in the knack of the night
Forgive all the favorites in your phone
Imagine yourself completely alone
Sit in the backyard in my pharmacy slippers
At least I'm not on the roof anymore
In a year or so, I hope nobody remembers
This, this run of episodes of my time on the floor
Need to recharge, light from the stars
Won't really reach anything, will it?
Binary capsules of all human culture
History and science and headless sculptures
Stories of monkeys and digital religions
Like life on a note of the last living pigeon

[Chorus]
Smoke detector, smoke detector
All you need to do is protect her
Smoke detector
Smoke detector, smoke detector
Blink and bless her and let her rest
Don't let my memory dissolve
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'll get better, I'll fluff the feathers
I'll punch in the numbers and I'll enter the letters
Why don't you let me lay here and listen to the distant sirens?
Wonder why they have a dog in the driver's seat
With a red helmet and his head out the window
It's getting closer no matter where we go
Brush your teeth and write your name
On the bottom of a brick under the window pane

[Verse 3]
Sift through the slush and the ash and the dust
For whatever stands out for whatever reason
If it's a laugh or a rush or a remembered feeling
You don't know what it means, but you don't wanna leave it
Put it in a plastic bag and put it in a pocket
Hang it on a hanger and put it in a closet
You'll know where it is whenever you need it
I make a good argument, admit it

[Chorus]
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
[Bridge]
Let's just try to remember the best of us
Let's just try to remember the best of us

[Verse 4]
Make a list of your loved ones in order of height
Laugh at the blackbirds in the black of the night
Forgive all the favorites in your phone
Imagine yourself completely alone
Sit in the backyard in my pharmacy slippers
At least I'm not on the roof anymore
In a year or so, I hope nobody remembers
This run of episodes of my time on the floor
Need to recharge, light from the stars
Won't really reach anything, will it?
Binary capsules of all human culture
Science and history and headless sculptures
Stories of monkeys and digital religions
Like a note on the ankle of the last living pigeon

[Chorus]
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
[Verse 5]
I'll get better, I'll fluff the feathers
I'll punch in the numbers and enter the letters
Why don't you lay here and listen to distant sirens with me?
I wonder if they have a dog in the driver's seat
With a red helmet and his head out the window
It's getting closer no matter where we go
Brush your teeth and write your name
On the bottom of a brick under the window pane

[Verse 6]
Sift through the slush and the ash and the dust
For whatever stands out for whatever reason
If it's a laugh or a rush or a remembered feeling
You don't know what it means, but you don't wanna leave it
Put it in a plastic bag and put it in a pocket
And hang it on a hanger and put it in a closet
You don't know where it is whenever you need it
I make a good argument, admit it

[Chorus]
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
You don't know how much I love you
Do you?
