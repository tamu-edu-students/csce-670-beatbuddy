(Oh)
(Oh)
(You're my cold heart)
(Oh)
(Oh)

[Verse: Elton John]
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you (Oh)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa with Elton John]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you (Oh)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa with Elton John]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart (Oh)
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby (Oh)
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have said

('Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find)
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid
