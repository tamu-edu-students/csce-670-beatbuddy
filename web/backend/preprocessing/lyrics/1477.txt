I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down, I get real down
When I'm high, I don't come down
And I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I could leave you just as fast

[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me, and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need ya

[Verse 2]
You do shit on purpose
You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things
But you're perfect, poorly wired circuit
And got hands like an ocean
Push you out, pull you back in
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause you see it from the same point of view

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me, and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need ya

[Bridge]
(I got issues, you got 'em too)
And one of them is how bad I need you
(I got issues, and you got 'em too)

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too (I got)
So give 'em all to me, and I'll give mine to you (You got 'em too)
Bask in the glory of all our problems (I got issues)
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em (You got 'em too)
Yeah, I got issues (I got)
And one of them is how bad I need ya (You got 'em too)
[Outro]
Yeah, I got issues (I got issues)
And one of them is how bad I need ya (You got 'em too)
Yeah, I got issues (I got)
And one of them is how bad I need ya109Embed Issues Nervous System Julia Michaels electro
