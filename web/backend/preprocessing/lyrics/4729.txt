Well, it rains and it pours when you're out on your own
If I crash on the couch, can I sleep in my clothes?
'Cause I've spent the night dancing, I'm drunk, I suppose
If it looks like I'm laughing, I'm really just askin' to leave
This alone, you're in time for the show
You're the one that I need, I'm the one that you loathe
You can watch me corrode like a beast in repose
'Cause I love all the poison, away with the boys in the band

[Pre-Chorus]
I've really been
On a bender, and it shows
So why don't you blow me
A kiss before she goes?

[Chorus]
Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
Your kiss, and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright, the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me

There's a place in the dark where the animals go
You can take off your skin in the cannibal glow
Juliet loves the beat and the lust it commands
Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands, Romeo

[Pre-Chorus]
I've really been
On a bender, and it shows
So why don't you blow me
A kiss before she goes?

[Chorus]
Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
Your kiss, and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright, the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me

[Chorus]
Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
Your kiss, and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright, the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
