Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you, for you
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you

[Verse 1]
As years go by
I'd race the clock with you
But if you died right now
You know that I'd die too
I'd die too
You remind me of the times
When I knew who I was
But still the second hand will catch us
Like it always does
We'll make the same mistakes
I'll take the fall for you
I hope you need this now
Because I know I still do

[Chorus]
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you

Should I bite my tongue
Until blood soaks my shirt
We'll never fall apart
Tell me why this hurts so much
My hands are at your throat
And I think I hate you
But still we'll say "remember when?"
Just like we always do
Just like we always do

[Chorus]
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
Yeah I'd spill my heart
Yeah I'd spill my heart for you

[Bridge]
My hands are at your throat
And I think I hate you
We made the same mistakes
Mistakes like friends do
My hands are at your throat
And I think I hate you
We made the same mistakes
Until the day I die
I'd spill my heart for you
[Chorus]
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
Until the day I die
Until the day I die9Embed
