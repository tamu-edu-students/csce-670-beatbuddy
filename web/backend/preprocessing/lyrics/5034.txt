[Refrain: Leony & FiNCH ASOZiAL]
When everything's fucked up and you're losin' your mind
It's like the world burned down and they left you behind
You feel alone 'cause no one's there by your side
But love goes on, oh yeah, love goes on
Oh, when everything goes wrong and you're losin' your mind
It's like the world burned down and they left you behind
You feel alone 'cause no one's there by your side
But love goes on, oh yeah, love goes on (On, on, on)
(On, on, on, on, o-o-o-o-on)
Easy peasy lemon squeezy

[Drop: Leony]
-thing's fucked up and you're losin' your mind
It's like the world burned down and they left you behind
You feel alone 'cause no one's there by your side
But love goes on, oh yeah, love goes on
Oh, when everything goes wrong and you're losin' your mind
It's like the world burned down and they left you behind
You feel alone 'cause no one's there by your side
But love goes on, oh yeah, love goes on (On, on, on)

[Strophe: FiNCH ASOZiAL]
Ey, warum lächelst du nicht? (Hä?)
Wenn du ins Fettnäpfchen trittst
Gerechtigkeit gibt's nicht
Die Schwächeren trifft es
Wenn dein Leben dich nervt (Ja?)
Ja, dann bete zum Herr'n (Amen)
Ach, was red' ich daher? (Yeah, yeah)
Fahr lächelnd in den Gegenverkehr (Yeah, yeah)
Glücklich sein ist doch so kinderleicht (Easy)
'N paar Millionen und dann stimmt der Vibe (Rolex)
Das schnelle Glück bringen die Insta-Likes
Wenn dein Kind nächtelang nur heult
Schmeiß weg, ich mach' dir neue
