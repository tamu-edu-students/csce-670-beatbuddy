(All day, all day)

[Interlude]

[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now
I've seen you look at strangers too many times
The love you want is of a different kind

[Verse 2: Neil Tennant]
Remember when we felt the sun?
A love like paradise, how hot it burned
A threat of distant thunder, the sky was red
And when you walked, you always turned every head

[Chorus: Neil Tennant & The Voice in Fashion]
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
(Domino dancing)

[Verse 3: Neil Tennant]
I thought that when we fought, I was to blame
But now I know you play a different game
I've watched you dance with danger, still wanting more
Add another number to the score

[Chorus: Neil Tennant & The Voice in Fashion]
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
(Domino dancing)

[Bridge: Neil Tennant]
When you look around, you wonder
Do you play to win?
Or are you just a bad loser?

[Verse 4: Neil Tennant]
I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now
I hear the thunder crashing, the sky is dark
And now a storm is breaking within my heart
