12 ContributorsGlitch Lyrics[Intro]
Close your eyes
Let your mind submerge
Are you ready?
Three, two, one

[Verse 1]
I feel a glitch in the cortex
Like a ghost in the shell
Caught the devil playing mind tricks
I feel the dread close in like the walls of a cell

[Refrain]
I cannot sleep, I cannot hide, I cannot take
One more night on the dark side of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I close my eyes to sleep, the shadows speak
And they won't stop when I'm awake

[Chorus]
Everything they say would seem
Feeds the fear inside of me
Lеt it feed the fear inside
Hеlp me take this pain away
Sleep is now my enemy
Now it feeds the fear inside of me

The fear inside of me

[Verse 2]
The fear hit like a shell shock
Body froze like my heart stopped
REM waves got my limbs locked down but my eyes wide open
Sheer terror manifest before me

[Refrain]
I cannot sleep, I cannot hide, I cannot take
Living this way on the dark side of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I close my eyes to sleep, the shadows speak
And they won't stop when I'm awake

[Chorus]
Everything they say would seem
Feeds the fear inside of me
Let it feed the fear inside
Help me take this pain away
Sleep is now my enemy
Now it feeds the fear inside of me

[Bridge]
I close my eyes to sleep (Sleep paralysis)
Let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me the fuck out
Let me the fuck out
[Chorus]
Everything they say would seem
Feeds the fear inside of me
Let it feed the fear inside
Help me take this pain away
Sleep is now my enemy
Now it feeds the fear inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
It's the fear inside of me (Me)

[Refrain]
I cannot sleep, I cannot hide, I cannot take
One more night on the dark side of my mind1Embed
