50 ContributorsBetter Than Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every girl from here to Soho
Loves to tell me things I don't know
Beautiful and smart, and not good for me
At all
All your boyfriends go to film school
Nathan was in plays in high school (how 'bout that?)
Me? I'm going to play the imbecile, who
Who keeps choosing you
Even though you're bi-polar and you're selfish and I hate you! Ahhh!

[Chorus]
Everyone is better than me, I think
Everyone is better than, better than me
Everyone is better than, better than me
Hey, hey! Oh, hey!

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
Look what you've done, now I'm a mess
Today I even thought I'd wear a dress
It's beautiful, so smart and no good for me
At all...

[Outro]
Yeah!
Everyone is better than me, I think
Throw your hands up if you agree with me
Now everyone is better than me, I think
Everyone is better than, better than me
Better than, oh hey, come on now!
Oh, oh!
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa!
