Yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes I don't let go
I shine, I shine, now the hate froze
Niggas mad ’cause they all hoes
Watching from the outside
Sometimes I don't let go
I shine, I shine, now the hate froze
Niggas mad 'cause they all hoes
Watching from the outside, ayy

[Verse 1]
Sauce as fuck, I’m verified
And I'm on your thottie mind
But I don't want her, 'cause I got a wife
Playin' with the kitty through the day and night
Playin' with the mind on the beat, oh, I
Shawty wanna swallow up the meat, oh, I
Shawty wanna swallow up the meat, oh, I
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes I don't let go
I shine, I shine, now the hate froze
Niggas mad 'cause they all hoes
Watching from the outside
Sometimes I don’t let go (Ayy)
I shine, I shine, now the hate froze
Niggas mad ’cause they all hoes
Watching from the outside
