I think of feelings that I can't throw
I don't want them to fade
They're warm enough to stay
When I feel cold
To be at ease
All these feelings
To be at ease
All these feelings

These feelings are all I know
Hidden in ways that I can't show
The burden feels okay
I'm used to the weight
All alone

To be at ease
All these feelings
To be at ease
All these feelingsYou might also likeEmbed
