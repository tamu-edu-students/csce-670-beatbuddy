Karma police, arrest this man, he talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge, he's like a detuned radio

[Verse 2]
Karma police, arrest this girl, her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill and we have crashed her party

[Chorus]
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us

[Verse 3]
Karma police, I've given all I can, it's not enough
I've given all I can, but we're still on the payroll

[Chorus]
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us

[Outro]
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myselfYou might also like105Embed Karma Police OK Computer Radiohead alternative
