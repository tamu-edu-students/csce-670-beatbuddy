3 ContributorsCoffe Cups and Cigarettes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Coffee cups and cigarettes
Upon the balcony
A lost philosophy
Breaking down
A summer frown has got the best of me
Won't you confess to me

[Chorus]
You don't need me
To function anymore
Take the keys and lock the door
You don't need me
To function anymore
Take the keys and lock the door
I'm going out of my mind

[Verse 2]
A glass of wine
At five to nine in the morning
The clearest warning
Pop your pills
As the day is barely dawning
I lie there yawning

[Verse 3]
Take a look at me now
I never really made you proud
I've been floating on the clouds of black and grey
So just leave me here like this
Without a lovers goodbye kiss
You know I'd only take the piss
I'm going out of my mind
You might also like[Chorus]
You don't need me
To function anymore
Take the keys and lock the door
You don't need me
To function anymore
Take the keys and lock the door
I'm going out of my mindEmbed
