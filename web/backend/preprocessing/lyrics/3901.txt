Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you, with a fine toothcomb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

[Verse 2: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kenny Rogers, Kenny Rodgers & Dolly Parton]
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, huhn huh
Making love with each other, huhn hah

[Chorus: Kenny Rodgers & Dolly Parton]
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah
From one lover to another, huhn hah

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

[Verse 4: Kenny Rodgers & Dolly Parton]
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

[Pre-Chorus 2: Dolly Parton, Kenny Rodgers & Dolly Parton]
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, huhn hah
Making love with each other, huhn hah

[Chorus: Kenny Rodgers & Dolly Parton]
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah
From one lover to another, huhn hah
[Interlude: Kenny Rodgers, Dolly Parton]
Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me

[Chorus: Kenny Rodgers & Dolly Parton]
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah
From one lover to another, huhn hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah
From one lover to another, huhn hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between4Embed
