25 ContributorsHorns Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey! In her heart, there's a hole
There's a black mark on her soul
In her hands is my heart
And she won't let go 'til it's scarred
Ha! Try to breathe, but I can't
'Cause the air she feeds me is damned
Got a touch like a thorn
'Cause the girl, she's hiding horns

[Chorus]
She got blood cold as ice
And a heart made of stone
But she keeps me alive
She's the beast in my bones
She gets everything she wants
When she gets me alone
Like it's nothin'
She got two little horns
And they get me a little bit

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's the fire in the sin
And I burn breathin' her in
Now it's love suicide
And I sell my soul for the high
Truth be told, I don't mind
'Cause her Hell's my paradise
She can crush every hope
Got her heels stompin' down my throat
You might also like[Chorus]
She got blood cold as ice
And a heart made of stone
But she keeps me alive
She's the beast in my bones
She gets everything she wants
When she gets me alone
Like it's nothin'
She got two little horns
And they get me a little bit

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
She got horns like a devil
Pointed at me and there's nowhere to run
From the fire she breathes
She got horns like a devil
Pointed at me and there's nowhere to run
From the fire she breathes
She got horns like a devil
Pointed at me and there's nowhere to run
From the fire she breathes
Horns like a devil
Pointed at me
She got two little horns
And they get me a little bit
[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
She got two little horns
And they get me a little bit10Embed
