I'm just a step away, I'm just a breath away
Losin' my faith today
We're fallin' off the edge today!
I am just a man, not superhuman!
I'm not superhuman!
Someone save me from the hate

[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
It's just another war
Just another family torn
We're falling from my faith today!
Just a step on the edge
Just another day in the world we live

[Chorus: John Cooper, Jen Ledger & Both]
I need a hero to save me now!
I need a hero!
To save me now!
I need a hero to save my life!
A hero will save me 
Just in time!

[Verse 2: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
I've gotta fight today to live another day
Speakin' my mind today
My voice will be heard today!
I've gotta make a stand, but I am just a man
I'm not superhuman!
My voice will be heard today
