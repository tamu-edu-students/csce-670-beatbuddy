Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

[Verse 1]
Oh, the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talking to me, but it's alright
She's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers make us too good for her to ignore
See, she's talking but I'm not entirely sure

[Chorus]
Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

[Verse 2]
Oh, a sudden disheartener
Somebody's partner's talking to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't
She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
And I knew, how could she not? She could have anyone she wants
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response
Like, "I don't mind, it'd be a big mistake for you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really, love, it's fine"
I said, "Really, love, it's fine"

[Verse 3]
And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy
I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh, but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse
She said, "It's the red wine this time," but that is no excuse10Embed
