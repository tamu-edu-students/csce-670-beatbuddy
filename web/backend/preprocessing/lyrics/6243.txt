20 ContributorsProducer Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
She was only seventeen
When producer man came offering that
All her dreams would come true
He said, "Come here, sweetie, I can make you a star!"
"I just want to see you flourish, and I know you'll make it far"
What she couldn't see was he was in it for the money (Ah-ah-ahh)

[Chorus]
Money, ah-ah-ahh
Money, money
Money, ah-ah-ahh
Money, money

[Verse 2]
Got the girl to move to L.A
Got the paperwork so she could sign her life away
And it was in his plan to work her 'til he got his pay, ay-ay-ayy
He said, "Sign right here," and sign she did
He knew that she was too young to know what she wanted
And now she's in the hands of good old producer man

[Chorus]
Money, ah-ah-ahh
Money, money
Money, money
Money, money

Knew his way to get the girl to listen
Made her into someone she isn't
Gotta listen well, only matters how you'll sell (Sell, sell)
"Sweetie, this was part of the deal
What you thought was fake, hun, the money is real"
It was too late now, caught herself with no way out (Ah-ah-ahh)

[Chorus]
Money, ah-ah-ahh
Money, money
Money, money
Money, money

[Bridge]
I am your only chance
And you know you want it bad
I'll make you a deal you can't refuse
A deal you'll never lose
I am your only chance
And you know you want it bad
I'll make you a deal you can't refuse
A deal you'll never lose

[Outro]
Sign on the line, 'cause you're running out of time
