Dada dada dada, dada, da da da dada, dada
Dadada dadada dada, dada, dada, dada
Let's go!

[Verse 1]
It's not easy making a name for yourself
Where do you draw the line?
I never thought I'd be in this far
Let's have some fun and never change up for anyone
Try not to miss me when I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
I sold my soul to the open road
I'll live my life alone!

[Chorus]
You won't find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leaving
And not coming back, you're right, and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna need you to try to follow along
I did the best that I could to try to write you songs
Now go tell them we sold out, like we're the ones who changed
I write what I feel, I say what I mean, you can't buy sincerity

Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
I sold my soul to the open road
I'll live my life alone!

[Chorus]
You won't find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leaving
And not coming back, you're right, and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all

[Bridge]
Don't forget yourselves, we made up our minds
Yeah, we signed three, four, five on that dotted line
Don't forget yourselves, we made up our minds
Yeah, we signed three, four, five on that dotted line

[Chorus]
You won't find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leaving
And not coming back, you're right, and I was wrong
You won't find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leaving
And not coming back, you're right, and I was wrong
[Post-Chorus]
This town will be the downfall of us all
This town will be the downfall of us all

[Outro]
Downfall of us all!
Downfall of us all!
Downfall of us all!
Downfall of us all!26Embed
