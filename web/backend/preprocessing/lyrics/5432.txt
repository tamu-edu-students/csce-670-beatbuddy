I'll give you whatever I can
But honestly, there's not a lot where I stand
Nobody knows where we'll go
But I've got a hunch that it feels like home, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
And nobody knows you like
I do, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
So take me down to earth
I'll listen to everything you say
If nothing else gets you through, gets you through
Then darling I'll cry with you, cry with you
And even though you hurt
I'm always a phone call away
As long as I'm here with you, here with you
Then darling I'll cry with you, cry with you
(Cry with you)

[Verse 2]
It's been a while since you've said
If I don't get famous, I'm better off dead
So pleasе, stick around for a while
'Cause therе's a whole lot that'll make you smile
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And nobody knows you like I do
And nobody cares like we do

[Chorus]
So take me down to earth
I'll listen to everything you say
If nothing else gets you through, gets you through
Then darling I'll cry with you, cry with you
And even though you hurt
I'm always a phone call away
As long as I'm here with you, here with you
Then darling I'll cry with you, cry with you
Cry with you

[Bridge]
I can't get it out of my head
Life's a bitch, pretty soon we'll be dead
I'm disassociating right now
Take my hand and we'll figure it out
I can't find the meaning, I can't find a reason
It hurts just to say it out loud (It hurts just to say it out loud)
And nothing's forever, I
Hope you get better, I'll make it up to you somehow

[Chorus]
So take me down to earth
I'll listen to everything you say
If nothing else gets you through, gets you through
Darling I'll cry with you, cry with you
And even though you hurt
I'm always a phone call away
As long as I'm here with you, here with you
Then darling I'll cry with you, cry with you
Cry with you2Embed
