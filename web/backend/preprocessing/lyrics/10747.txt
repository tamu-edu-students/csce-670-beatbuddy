5 ContributorsYou Drive Me Crazy LyricsYou know, Baby, when you're in my arms
I can feel your loving magic charms
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy

And when I'm looking in those big blue eyes
I start afloating round in paradise
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy

Heaven must have sent you down
Down for you to give me a thrill
Evry time you touch me
Evry time you hold me
My heart starts speeding like a train on a track

I love you, Baby, and it's plain to see
I love you, honey, it was meant to be
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, oh

Heaven must have sent you down
Down for you to give me a thrill
Evry time you touch me
Evry time you hold me
My heart starts speeding like a train on a track

I love you, Baby, and it's plain to see
I love you, honey, it was meant to be
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, oh
You might also likeAnd when I'm looking in those big blue eyes
I start afloating round in paradise
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy

You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, ohEmbed
