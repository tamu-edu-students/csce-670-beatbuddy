1 ContributorWe’ll be coming back - calvin harris & example LyricsWe took it all apart
But I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away
But I miss the thing, are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Got to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day
You can see it from afar
We were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something not great
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away
But I miss the thing, are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Got to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, or ignore the stars
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Got to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one dayYou might also likeEmbed We'll Be Coming Back (feat. Example) 18 Months Calvin Harris;Example progressive-house
