1 Contributor​my type Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't let nobody say you're psycho
Even when you're on a tightrope
They don't know that it's the pain for something else
What a shame they couldn't paint it on themselves

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a second on me
It's a habit when it's old
When you get up in the middle of the night
Feel like you're losing control
You know we're never gon' be like

[Chorus]
But you feel right
I can't define it for you
You get my vibe
Like no one else beforе you
Yeah, you feel right
There's just somеthing about you
You're my type
You're my, you're my...

[Verse 2]
Don't you think I noticed that
You've been keeping that distance, yeah
You know I don't mind if you're candid
With you I feel like I am blinded, yeah
We go dumb-de-de-dumb-dumb
Feel so faded now
We've been down-de-de-down-down
And now I'm walking on a tightrope waiting for you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But it's a habit when it's old
When you get up in the middle of the night
Feel like you're losing control
You know we're never gon' be like

[Chorus]
But you feel right (You feel right)
I can't define it for you (I can't define you)
You get my vibe
Like no one else before you
Yeah, you feel right (You feel right)
There's just something about you (Oh)
You're my type (You're my type)
You're my, you're my...

[Outro]
But you feel right (You feel right)
I can't define it for you (I can't define you)
You get my vibe (Oh-oh)
Like no one else before you
Yeah, you feel right (You feel right)
There's just something about you (Something about you)
You're my type (You're my type)
You're my, you're my...Embed
