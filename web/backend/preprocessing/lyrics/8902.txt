57 ContributorsArsonist’s Lullabye Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
When I was a child, I heard voices
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices
I learned the voices died with me
When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame, something in it had a power
Could barely tear my eyes away

[Chorus]
All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
When I was sixteen, my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me
I knew this scent was mine alone

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
Always keep them on a leash

[Bridge]
When I was a man, I thought it ended
When I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake

[Outro]
All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash39Embed
