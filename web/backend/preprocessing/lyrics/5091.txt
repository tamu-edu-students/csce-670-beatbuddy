3 ContributorsLove Is Gone Lyrics[Verse]
Don't go tonight
Stay here one more time
Remind me what it's like, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And let's fall in love
One more time
I need you now
By my side
It tears me up
When you turn me down
I'm begging, please
Just stick around

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, don't leave me
I want you here with me
I know that your love is gone
I can't breathe, I'm so weak
I know this isn't easy
Don't tell me that your love is gone
That your love is gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And let's fall in love
One morе time
I need you now
By my side
It tears mе up
When you turn me down
I'm begging, please
Just stick around
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm sorry, don't leave me
I want you here with me
I know that your love is gone
I can't breathe, I'm so weak
I know this isn't easy
Don't tell me that your love is gone
That your love is goneEmbed
