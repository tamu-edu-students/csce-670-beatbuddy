Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie

[Verse 1]
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Tell your mom, girl, and I won't stop it until you're mine, girl
And you can't stop that until your mine, girl
And I can't find out what you want, what you got
I got that honey-pie, come bite it
Bring your own fork, girl, you know I don't provide it

[Chorus]
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie

Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey

Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
