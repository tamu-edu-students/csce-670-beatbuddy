24 ContributorsPressure Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm in a mood
I'm still tastin' you
Pacin' around for days
Crave you back with me
Pretend I'll be good

[Chorus]
Give me silence, silence, I just need your touch
Know your violence violence, hides on the tip of your tongue
In the darkness darkness, we go on and on
Always under pressure
(Pressure, uh)

[Verse 2]
Can't take it back (Back)
When you talk like that, no
You make me see red
Still end up in my bed
Know I want that sweat
Aye, yeah

[Chorus]
Give me silence, silеnce, I just need your touch
Know your violence violеnce, hides on the tip of your tongue
In the darkness darkness, we go on and on
Always under pressure
(Pressure, uh)

I don't know, don't know what to do
Tension just feels so thick in the room
I don't know, don't know
I don't know, don't know what to do
Tension just feels so thick in the room
Always under pressure
(Ah, ah)

[Chorus]
Give me silence silence, I just need your touch
Know your violence violence, hides on the tip of your tongue
In the darkness darkness, we go on and on
Always under pressure9Embed
