Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then, she tried to run
And then on a night with the settin' sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone

[Pre-Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
They've warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hidin' in the dark
Then somethin' came creepin'
It told her, "Don't you worry, just

[Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh"

[Drop: Emelie Hollow]
Just let me in, ooh

She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold, thin ice
Then it broke and she awoke again

[Pre-Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
Then she ran faster and
Start screamin', "Is there someone out there?
Please help me, come get me"
Behind her, she can hear it say

[Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
"Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh"

[Drop: Emelie Hollow]
Just let me in, ooh

[Bridge: Emelie Hollow]
Ooh
"Everything you want in gold (Ooh)
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh"
[Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
"Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh"

[Outro: Emelie Hollow]
Then she ran faster and
Start screamin', "Is there someone out there?
Please help me"
"Just let me in, ooh"24Embed
