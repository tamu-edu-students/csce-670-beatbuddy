A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

[Chorus]
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

[Verse 2]
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with

[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

[Verse 3]
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
You might also like[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises, please
(Get me out of here)113Embed No Surprises OK Computer Radiohead rock
