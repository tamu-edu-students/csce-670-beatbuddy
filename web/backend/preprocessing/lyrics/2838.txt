112 ContributorsAnimals Lyrics[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preyin' on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals
Like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals, animals
Like animals-mals
Baby, I'm (Hey)

[Verse 1]
So what you tryin' to do to me? (Hey)
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies (Hey)
But we get along when I'm inside you
Yeah (Hey)
You're like a drug that's killin' me (Hey)
I cut you out entirely (Hey)
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free (Hey)
You can find other fish in the sea (Hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be (Hey)
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you makin' that sound (Hey)
Takin' me down, rollin' on the ground (Hey)
You can pretend that it was me, but no (Hey)
Oh
