We were so magical, why end this way?
I know you're furious, yeah, just like me
You got good reasons, but I do too
What really happened here? I wish I knew

[Pre-Chorus]
It escalated so fast
We yelled things we can't take back
It escalated too soon
I know what they say, I know that they say that

[Chorus]
No one dies from love
Guess I'll be the first
Will you remember us
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?
No one dies from love
Guess I'll be the first
Will you remember us
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?

[Verse 2]
I tried my best with you, you claim the same
Somehow, we're strangers, but share this pain
Keep writin' letters I'll never send
Don't want you movin' on when it's my end
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It escalated so fast (So fast)
We yelled things we can't take back (Take back)
It escalated too soon
I know what they say, I know that they say that

[Chorus]
No one dies from love
Guess I'll be the first
Will you remember us
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?
No one dies from love (No one dies from love)
Guess I'll be the first (Guess I'll be the first)
Will you remember us (You'll remember)
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?

[Bridge]
(Love)

[Chorus]
No one dies from love (No one dies from love)
Guess I'll be the first (Guess I'll be the first)
Will you remember us (You'll remember)
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?
No one dies from love (No one dies from love)
Guess I'll be the first (Guess I'll be the first)
Will you remember us (You'll remember)
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?2Embed
