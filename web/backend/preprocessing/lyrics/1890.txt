Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape

[Verse 2]
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

[Verse 3]
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

[Verse 4]
Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill

[Verse 5]
And you can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke
You might also like[Outro]
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke88Embed Exit Music (For A Film) OK Computer Radiohead alt-rock
