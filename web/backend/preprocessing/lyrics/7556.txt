4 ContributorsCarried Me With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're the soul who understands
The scars that made me who I am
Through the drifting sands of time
I got your back and you got mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you bear a heavy load
I'll be your wheels, I'll be the road
I'll see us through the thick and thin
For love and loss until the end

[Chorus]
'Cause you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue
I was just too blind to see
Like a lighthouse in a storm
You were always guiding me
Yeah, it's true
You carried me with you

[Verse 2]
From the day it all began
Yeah, you were there, you took my hand
And when I hurt a bit too deep
You watched me as I fell asleep

And when my head was in the clouds
You found a way to pull me out
You picked my heart up off the ground
And it showed me love was all around

[Chorus]
Yeah, you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue
I was just too blind to see
Like a lighthouse in a storm
You were always guiding me
Yeah, it's true
You carried me with you

[Bridge]
Oh, we'll be sittin' on the world together (Ooh-ooh)
Watchin' as the days turn into night (Ooh-ooh)
We know how to brave the stormy weather (Ooh-ooh)
And we're never givin' up without a fight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you should ever bear a heavy load
I'll be your wheels, I'll be the road
I'll see us through the thick and thin
For love and loss until the end
[Chorus]
'Cause you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue
I was just too blind to see
Like a lighthouse in a storm
You were always guiding me
Yeah, it's true
You carried me with you

[Outro]
Oh, you carried me with you1Embed
